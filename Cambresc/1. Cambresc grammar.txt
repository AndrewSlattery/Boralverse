- Mutations

There are four types of initial mutation in Cambresc, usually triggered by a preceding word.

-- Soft mutation
This is by far the most common. Its effects are
> p t c/k/q m/b d g ł rh 
> b d g     v   ð Ø l r

Relevant words which trigger it: <am, ei¹, gan, i, ne, o¹, y/yr¹ (with feminine singular nouns)>.

The direct object of a finite verb also undergoes the soft mutation.
> kefl; diskynes i gefl | horse; alight.1s.pst 1s horse "I dismounted a horse" 
> kyraeð; gra vi gyraeð | arrive; do.1s 1s arrive "I arrive"

Adjectives modifying feminine singular nouns also undergo the soft mutation.
> mor bah | sea small "a small sea"
> łong vah | ship small "a small ship"

Extraordinarily, <d> does not mutate to <ð> if the preceding word ending in <-s>.
> nos da "good night" (nos "night" being a feminine noun)

-- Nasal mutation
> p  t  c/k/q b d g
> mh nh ngh   m n ng

This mutation does not appear in the text.

-- Aspirate mutation
> p  t  c/k qu
> ph th ch  quh

Relevant words which trigger it: <a¹, a², ei², gyda, na³>.

-- Mixed mutation
This mutation acts like the aspirate mutation on <p t c/k/qu>, and the soft mutation on <m/b d g ł rh>.

Relevant words which trigger it: <na¹, na², ni¹>.

- Verb Morphology

Verbs inflect for past and nonpast (only the latter of which appears in the text). Nonpast verbs used as finite verbs usually have a future sense, except with stative verbs, which can also have a present sense.
> gωn i | know-1s 1s "I know", gυiðωn i | know-1s.pst 1s "I knew"
> arhosa vi | stay-1s 1s "I will stay", arhoses i stay-1s.pst 1s "I stayed"

The text also contains one use of the conditional, there used as a politeness marker and pointed out in the lexicon.

Other TAM senses are achieved via auxiliary verb constructions. The verb <greud> "to do" creates verbs with perfective aspect, in past or nonpast tense.
> grei di ðrysυ vi | do-2s 2s confuse 1s "you (just) confused me"
> graeth o dybjed yr ateb | do-3s.pst 3s.m guess def answer "he guessed the answer"

The complex <bod ... yn²>, on the other hand, creates verbs with imperfective aspect.
> ω vi'n arhos | be-1s 1s comp stay "I am not moving"
> oeðyh whi'n canυ | be-2pl.pst 2pl comp sing "you were singing"

The complex <bod ... am> created verbs with future tense, esp. near future or highly-probable/intended futures.
> mae'r dyn am roi boned i'w reg  | be-3s=def man about give bonnet to=3s.m.poss wife "the man will give a bonnet to his wife"

- Syntax

-- Noun Phrase

The definite article <y, yr, 'r> precedes the noun. Feminine singular nouns undergo the soft mutation after the definite article.
> gωr, y gωr "a husband, the husband"
> greg, y reg "a wife, the wife"

Adjectives follow the noun. They undergo the soft mutation after feminine singular nouns.
> gωr da "a good husband"
> greg ða "a good wife"

Genitive phrases "the husband of the doctor", "the Sun Hotel" are formed by simple apposition. Nouns which are possessed in this way cannot themselves take a definite article.
> gωr y meðyg | husband def doctor
> tavarn y heυl | hotel the sun

Pronominal possession consists of a possessive pronoun before the noun (often triggering some mutation), and a resumptive pronoun after the possessee.
> ei dad o | 3s.m.poss father 3s "his father"
> eih grageð whi | 2pl.poss wife-pl 2pl "your wives"

In formal writing or speech, the resumptive pronoun may be omitted.

-- Adpositions

Adpositions precede their noun phrase. Many prepositions have inflected personal forms used instead of explicit pronouns.
> i'r łongor | to=def ship-pl "to the ships"
> iðyn | to-3pl "to them"

-- Verb Phrase

Cambresc is VSO.
> Pentωrroð y dyn y cathod | collect-3s.pst def man def cat-pl "the man collected the cats"

The direct object of a finite verb undergoes the soft mutation (note in the above example "y cathod", beginning with a vowel, doesn't change).

In practice, sentences often use an auxiliary, with syntax Aux S (prep) V O.
> Greωch whi weld hωnno | do-2pl 2pl see that.m "you see that"
> ω vi am arhos | be.1s 1s about stay "I'm going to stay"

Negative sentences make use of a preverbal particle <ni(d)>, which triggers the mixed mutation, and a particle dim which becomes (the first part of) the direct object and thus is usually mutated to ðim.
> ni raethυm i ðim haeðυ | neg do-1s.pst 1s neg win | "I didn't win"

Questions use a preverbal particle <ne>, which triggers the soft mutation.
> ne weles ti'r mor? | q see-2s.pst 2sg=def sea "could you see the sea?"

--- Possessed Verbs

Complement clauses (I suppose *that you are a doctor*) and clauses following certain conjunction (before *he can catch them*) with proniminal subjects are formed in Cambresc using possessed verbs. These use the same syntax as ordinary possession.
> eih bod whi | 2pl.poss be 2pl "that you are"
> ei ał o | 3s.m.poss can 3s.m "that he can"

Here they are used in context.
> tybja vi'h bod whi'n veðyg | suppose-1s 1s=2pl.poss be 2pl=comp doctor "I suppose that you are a doctor"
> kyn ei ał o eυ dal nhω | before 3s.m.poss can 3s.m 3pl.poss catch 3pl "before he can catch them"

-- Fronting

Cambresc can front almost any constituent to the front of the sentence. In affirmative sentences the preverbal particle <yr, 'r> is often inserted after the preposed element.
> meωn ty'r ω vi'n byw | in house=pt be.1s 1s=comp live "I live *in a house*"
> y nghi bides i vo | 1s.poss dog feed-1s.pst 1s 3s.m "I fed my dog" 

In the second example, note the resumptive pronoun, necessary when fronting a subject or direct object.

If a phrase starting with the complement particle <yn²> is fronted, the <yn> is omitted.
> mae vo'n blino | be.3s 3s.m=comp annoy "he is being annoying"
> blino'r mae vo | annoy=pt be.3s 3s.m "he is being *annoying*"

- The copula <bod>

The copula has several extra forms unique to it. The ones relevant in the text are detailed here.

<mae>: third-person singular nonpast, affirmative; used for auxiliary, copular and existential meanings.
> mae hi'n canυ | be.3s 3s.f=comp sing "she is singing"
> mae vo'n ðyn | be.3s 3s.f=comp man "he is a man"
> mae cath yn y goeden | be.3s cat in def tree "there's a cat in the tree"

<oes>: third-person singular non-past, negative or interrogative; used only for the existential meaning.
> Nid oes dim cath yn y goeden | neg be.3s neg cat in def tree "there are no cats in the tree"
> Oes dynjon o'r davarn? | be.3s man-pl from=def hotel | "are there men from the hotel?"

<sy>: third-person singular nonpast; used only in relative clauses in which the subject is relativised or complement clauses which share a subject with the main clause; "who is, that are, who will be"
> y dyn sy'n canυ | def man be.3s=comp sing "the man who is singing"
> łongor sy doc am ðadangori | ship-pl be.3s soon about unmoor "ships which will set off soon"

As with other verbs in relative clauses <sy> uses the negative particle <na¹> instead of <ni(d)>.
