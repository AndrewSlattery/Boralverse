Once upon a time, a man went for a walk in a park that isn't far from my neighbouhood. He heard a baby crying. Whose baby was this? He went towards the sound of the crying, but it became quiet before stopping completely. Two misshapen hands with very sharp nails appeared, reaching out and grabbing the man. It was a demon that eats people! In the end, nothing remained but his torn clothes.
