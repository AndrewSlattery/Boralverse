A few years ago, a man walked in a park not far from my neighbourhood. He heard a baby crying. Whose baby was this? He followed the sound of the crying, but it became quiet, then stopped completely. Two gnarled hands with very sharp nails appeared, reaching out and grabbing the man. It was a spirit that eats people. In the end, all that remained were his torn clothes.
