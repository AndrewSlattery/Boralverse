lon cost /lɔn ˈkɔst/ [lʊŋˈkɔst] free (of charge), freely given

< “without cost”. The first word is from Old Boral loin “away from”, from Latin longē “from far off”; the second a deverbal derivation of the verb costar “to cost, to be worth” (first attested 12C), from Latin constō “I consist of, I cost”.

bakilau /ˌbakiˈlo/ [ˌbakɪˈlo] cod, marine fish of the family Gadidae

< Origin contested. Extant from 9C as cabeilau, bacalau (among other variants), from Middle Dutch (Mi-Willem), cf. French cabillaud “cod”. Entered Middle Dutch either from some derivation of baculum “stick, rod”, or else from Basque kabailao “cod”. Formerly assumed to be a direct loan from Vask into Boral – see also other naval/fishing terminology like hagr “mast" – but this is now considered phonetically untenable.

nohas /noˈhaz/ [nʊˈxaz] (of economics) right-wing, conservative

< 1751, from Arabic نحاس (nuḥās) with the same sense, and originally “copper”. Inspired by the Copper faction in the court of Malik Hisham Al-Rashid (reigned 1601-1610) of Libya, who petitioned against the poor reforms he oversaw. The Copper, and their opposition, the Tin, took their names from the two principal colours of the Libyan banner at the time, which was quartered into two black, one white, and one orange field. These two terms – nohas and casdir – were borrowed into various European languages through the success of the Vascon writer David Bensaíd's treatise on statecraft The Three Cities, which was translated into over twenty languages. Compare for example French nouase, kasdir.

Stou y Duc coy l'eç nohas parmy sull'administration d'autortað may accarr.

viol cemtir /vjɔl ʦɛmˈtɪʀ/ [vɪˈjɔw ʦɪnˈtɪː] graveyard fiddles

< The first word from Mediæval Tuscane viola, probably from Old Vascon viula, from Late Latin vitula (all with the same meaning). The second from Old Boral cemiteȝr, from Latin cœmētērium “burial ground”, from Greek κοιμητήριον “sleeping chamber”.

Refers to the mysterious sound of string instruments in the air, which in Borlish folklore is attributed to various spirits connected to death, and to cemeteries in particular. Usually said to be low, mournful melodies. Apparently a tradition peculiar to Borland, as no closely analogous figures are seen in stories abroad.

Featured  in the opera Ale in Fiamme “Wings Afire” (a retelling of the story of Icarus which famously takes place entirely after the events of the myth), composed by Venisian Chiarina Bruno and first performed in 1824. Her first work, she is said to have heard the tale of the viol cemtir from her brother Jacomo, who had fought alongside Borlish soldiers in the Second German War.

Refers to the first snowfall of the year (that is, on or after the first of March), if there is one. Years with a green snowfall are generally considered unlucky, as a symptom of a long and bitter preceding winter.

< present participle of retrasir “to cross back over”, being the prefix re- “again, once more” with the verb trasir “to cross”. This verb is either a somewhat irregular derivation of Latin trānsvertō “I turn across”, or directly from the preposition tras “across” + -ir.

Ambrose¹ III (17 March 1435 - 29 February 1518) was king of Vascony from 1456 until his death, making him the longest ruler in Vascon history. He rose to the throne with the country at its greatest extent during his reign: from Bordew in the north to Port Calè in the south, although in practice Vascon rule barely reached as far as Braga.

King Ambrose III pushed for naval development, establishing the New Navarre Enterprise in 1458. He aimed to capitalise on Vascon supremacy in the fishing trade, trading cod from Dunclothe and Valland throughout the Middlesea. And of course, it was just such a ship that landed on Mendevan² shores in 1471 and introduced Eurasia to the Novomund.

Despite losing Vascony's Middlesea coast to Burgundy and Barcelon, and despite never marrying, King Ambrose III is remembered well for presiding over a period of relative peace and prosperity. His death presaged the decline of Vascony; it lost over a fifth of its population in the Second Great Dying, and ceded Portingale (its economic heart, having benefited the most from Novomundine trade) to Andalus after the Romantic Wars of the seventeenth century.

The Brethin of Kernow [1] (Boral: Y Brethin a Cornou) were in the late mediæval period the most influential school of the Brethin religious society. They saw a substantial increase in membership through the twelfth century and counted among their members (Roman) Pope Damian VI (1199-1208) and the saint Victor of Dunchurch.

The Brethin (named for their distinctive heavy cloak; in Old Welsh, their bretin) were founded in Tremonnow [2], at that time in Devon, as an order devoted to record-keeping and the maintenance of history. Originally, they preserved in particular the history of the Christianisation of Albion [3] and Ireland, but quickly expanded their remit to secular history. They spread rapidly through the Briton states and later made inroads into France, Burgundy and even Andalus.

The Brethin of Kernow were notable for being a single organisation which admitted both men and women into their orders, although their institutions were segregated by gender. Some members were sent out of the monasteries to advise in courts across Europe, most (in)famously in the Crovatian [4] House of Domago, whose Duke so favoured his Kernish advisors that his siblings organised a coup against him.

… the death of up to one-fifth of the population.

Of course, despite the name, not everywhere in Europe suffered so badly from the Second Great Dying as did Portingale. Those more inland areas, such as Boham and Burgundy (having lost its coastal territory to House Amigòt in 1499) endured far fewer casualties simply by virtue of being further from the main mode of transmission: naval trade. It was not by chance that the first recorded death attributable to this plague was in Damvath in Borland [1], said at the time to be the most-trafficked port city outside the Middlesea [2].

It is a common misconception, popularised further by the famous scene in Maresca's 1931 film Frutto Amaro (Bitter Fruit), that people blamed cats and dogs for the sickness sweeping the continent. This idea, first attested in connection with the Second Great Dying only several decades after the fact, perhaps originated with the tale of the monastery at Bonn, which after several deaths to an “unknown illness” in 1512 (probably luetic pox [3]) banished all animals from the monastery and (unsuccessfully) from the neighbouring village, claiming they were a Satanic influence.

In fact, the reaction to the Dying varied significantly across Europe. The countries of Albion [4], having for the most part escaped the first continental plague the century before, and furthermore still recovering from the Wars of Fealty, were perhaps the least prepared for an epidemic, and indeed…

excerpt: New Skies, Old Stories by Simon d'Estiala, published by Prindor Marsillès, 1980

… in her twilight years she campaigned for reforms to Saxony's inheritance law, ultimately unsuccessfully, although her political society would (after her death) spearhead the suffrage movements in Saxony, Denmark, and across the Latin republics.

The Voidtale craze sparked by Sneider's seminal work persisted until the Second German War, when its optimistic and exploratory character dropped rather rapidly out of fashion. Nonetheless there are examples generally counted as Voidtale works to be found later: most notable is Narayanan's series of landscapes depicting the surfaces of other planets orbiting our Sun. Importantly, he portrays these places as barren and inhospitable, in stark contrast to the xenic [1] worlds of Sneider or her imitators. This illustrates the shift in tone in many areas of art following the war, as industry swept the world and the age of the Global Workshop dawned.

It is perhaps foolhardy to attribute the decline of Voidtale trevolds [2] solely to the gloom of post-war Europe. We might say, for example, that the idea of exploring new lands and meeting new civilisations had lost its shine, with the opening of Caddisow [3] leaving few “mysterious lands” to discover, and the developing steeple-mesh [4] allowing people everywhere to communicate far more rapidly (in particular, to discover that distant nations were often much less exotic than one imagined!).

King Vigo the Magnificent (Vigo Magnificens, rex Brittonum)

The Kernish kingdoms at the dawn of the eighth century had only recently been unified, ruled by widowed Queen Maud of Angeus. Her son Vigo ascended to the throne upon her death in 720, shortly after the Catumagin Accord which ended hostilities and established an official border with the Kingdom of the Franks.

[Recall that the region now known as Kernow had at the time many names, including Armorica, Brittania and Dumnonia (this taken from the region in Albion whence the Britons had emigrated); the modern name dates from the eleventh century when the House of Kernow allied with the Normans to take the throne.]

King Vigo is remembered chiefly for spearheading the reconquest of Devon, which had been under the sole authority of the Kingdom of Wessex since the final defeat at Gaulford in 656 (although much of Cornwall had never entirely submitted to English rule). He had married Guinnumar, daughter to King David I of Wynneth, and had managed to secure Welsh assistance with the invasion.

After over two decades of intermittent warfare with Wessex and the victory at Petherton, Vigo was crowned King of Greater Devon (rex Magnæ Dumnoniæ), unifying Devon and Kernow. He had at least three children: among them were Cadern the Doubter, who would become king upon Vigo's death in 761, and his daughter Iseld, who later became the first patron of the Brethin of Tremonnow, and for whom the Iseld House in Bristow is named.

- in translation, from the collected correspondence of Absolon Mortenszen, playwright and commentator in Alburgh, Denmark

[Penned the morning of the 18th of March, 1560 Nascentiæ]

To the Good Sir Anscon d'Aupont,

I hope you are well recovered from the ague of which you spoke in your last missive; I need not remind you to consider leaving the city until the bulk of the trading has ended. One never knows what foreign ills merchants may bring, as my grandfather could have attested [1]…

The town remains as dull since you departed as it was before we met, you will be pleased to hear. In point of fact, even the decent lodging-house on the strand is poorer for having banned all the interesting people in town; perhaps it speaks poorly of me that they yet allow me entrance, though I will at least avail myself of the views while I can.

My dear brother (you may remember his shoes) is celebrating the birth of his daughter in the usual way; I continue to be astonished Beatrys consented to marry him, though she has been managing to escape him and the baby often enough to visit myself and Clara. We, you will note, have not yet succumbed to the child-bearing impulses the new friar insists we all harbour within.

There is a new friar at the hostel, less talkative and (if you will believe my wife) less handsome than Daniel. More than anything he reminds me of the moralising mentor one sees in the dreadful morality plays they still show down in the city [2]; he seems the sort to dream of visiting Rome and upon arriving declare it insufficiently Christian! One supposes Lorenzo's new Machines of Helios sculpture about which you droned on at me for hours might send the good man directly into an apoplexy, which would at least be entertaining…

The new play is a mild success [3], despite the inclement weather rather betraying the fact that Alburgh is not, to my regret, Barcelon. Clara has had marvellous fun with the new fabrics and dyes; please accept my sincerest gratitude for the billrod [4], although it is far too expensive to use regularly.

I leave with you my kindest regards,

A. Mortenszen

from “An Abridged History of Northern Albion” by Aidan Donblane, published by Cloddale Primers, 1940 (with commentary by his daughter Anhart, 1980)

…and thus, with the aid of Harald the Blue, established the Githel Kingdom of Scotland in what had been Pictland. Records of the Picts quickly become scanty, suggesting an acceleration of the encroachment of Githel language and culture from the west, into Murray [1].

With the Northumber conquest of Eidin (modern Edinbrough) in 928, the Kingdom of Dunclothe lost the remaining vestiges of its eastern coast. However, the extended Viking in the east had left many of their eponymous Isles severely underdefended [2], and over the ensuing decades, Dunclothe under Roderick would invade many of them: first Arran in 934, and most importantly, Mann fell in 942.

While the inevitable acrimony this expansion engendered with both the Irish kingdoms and with Denmark [3] is beyond the scope of this book, we shall briefly examine its effects on Northumber, on the new Scotland, and on Wynneth to the southwest.

Relations with the Kingdom of Northumber cooled from the moment Edinbrough fell; the common enemy both states had in the Norrish (recall the conquest of Yorwick) presumably helped speed the process along. According to the relevant copies of the English Chronicle, the bride of King Radulf, who succeeded his uncle in 951, was one “Atre of Cheswic”; this is suspected to be the same town as Cumbrian “Keswick”, although whether she was a daughter of King Roderick is unclear…

—

[1] Recent research calls into question the then-prevailing theory that Alba (and in turn Scotland) only experienced significant Norse influence during and after the eleventh-century migrations. Placename analysis (see F. Berger, 1977) has been correlated with dig sites and suggests that the kingdom had a significant Norse subtrate from its inception.

[2] This is a simplification: the Norse ascendancy through the ninth century and the beginning of the tenth had at last reached its peak, and politics further east (as well as the interference of the French Normans) diminished the resources that the Sodrick kings had at their disposal.

[3] That is, the various states making up what are now Denmark and Horth, and so on.

scartellar /ˌxaʀteˈlaʀ/ to tear apart, to rend, to quarter

< 13C, from early Middle French esquartiler “to quarter, to divide into four” (used particularly in heraldry to describe the separation of a coat of arms into four parts), possibly a derivation from esquarter “to separate”, from Vulgar Latin exquartō “I divide into four parts”, from quartus “fourth, quarter”.

Y scon hagraç foy scartellað par un hombeul abject.

descombr /dɛsˈkɔmbʀ̩/ to go to bed, to lie down to sleep

fourth conjugation, -oy variant (past participle descont)

< from Old Boral de(s)combr “to recline”, from Latin dēcumbō “I lie down, I fall”. Evidence from Taglour etc. suggests the pronunciation [deˈʃɔmbr̩] was common until at least the sixteenth century, but analogy with other verbs in des-, such as descovrir “to discover” produced the modern pronuncation.

Com os tu suggerir ig jo so ja descont pre minogt ?

Let us understand the extent to which the European languages are an incestuous foudoir “clusterfuck” by looking at four Borlish words which all derive from the single Ancestral Eurasian word ƕnōghs “finger/toenail”.

ongr (a pie) /ˈɔngʀ̩ a ˈpje/ [ˈɔŋg‿ʀa ˌpje] toenails, hooves

< Old Boral ongl' að pie with the same meaning (nails of the foot), from the Latin words ungula “nail, claw”, a diminutive of unguis (idem.), and pedem “foot”.

Jo pieð ig vostrell'ivan foln noc mell'ongr a pie.
I ask that your children don't step on my toes.
/ʒo ˈpjɛθ aj vɔˌstʀeliˈvan ˈfoln̩ ˌnɔk meˈlɔngʀ̩ a ˌpje/

ongulað /ˌɔngiˈlaθ/ [ˌɔŋgɪˈlah] hooved animal, ungulate

< late 17C, borrowed from Latin ungulātus “having hooves or claws” with influence from ongr “hoof”, or perhaps via French ongulé with the same meaning and influenced by French ongle. The Latin from ungula “claw, hoof” plus the adjectival derivation -ātus. First used as a noun in Borlish in Jan Prestr's 1780 work Classifaction of the Child-bearing Beasts.

Il saven noc ig balen son comportandessem a ongulað.
They didn't know that whales were most closely related to ungulates.
/ˌɪl saˈvɛn nɔk ˌaj baˈlɛn sɔn ˌkɔmpɔʀtanˈdɛsɛm a ˌɔngiˈlaθ/

nagl /nɛjl/ [ˈnɛjʊ] peg, dowel

< 8C, from Old Boral naȝl “nail, peg”, borrowed from Old English nægl “peg (tool for fastening), plectrum”. This from Classical German naglas “(finger)nail”, a derivation of the ancestral ƕnōghs.

Un ellips es y form traçað n'un cort boucr a dou nagl vardað tis.
An ellipse is the shape made by a pen in a taut loop attached to two pegs.
/ɪn elɪps ɛz y fɔʀm tʀaʣaθ nɪn kɔʀt bucʀ̩ a du nɛjl vaʀdað tɪz/

onyx /oˈnɪks/ [ʊˈniks] onyx (gemstone), scallop (species of mussel), variety of pasta in the shape of a shell

< Seen variously in Old and Early Middle Boral as oneç, onniç, etc.; relatinised to onyx by 14C. The Latin onyx “onyx, yellowish gemstone, scallop” borrowed from Greek ὄνυξ (ónux, “nail, onyx”), from the ancestral ƕnōghs as before.

Y lagç onyx con saus a kes er collüið de bou aromað.
The scallop pasta in cheese sauce came with spiced beef.
/i ˈlɛjʦ oˈnɪks kɔn ˌsoz a ˈkɛz ɛʀ ˌkolaˈjɪθ de ˈbu ˌaʀoˈmaθ/

##

cordamn /kɔʀˈdamn̩/ [kɔːˈdamɐn] rigging, tackle (on a sailing vessel)

< from Mediaeval Latin cordāmen “(collection of) ropes”, from cordō “I tie up” with the nominaliser -men. Probably an independent development, unrelated to the parallel Italian derivation cordame, with the same meaning (although later confluence is probably due to contact).

Y ci annað seyon fait sur mar, i fruya soul parmy toð y cordamn.
While he was away at sea, he would dance around in the rigging.
/ˌi ʦi aˈnaθ siˌjɔn ˈfet sɪʀ ˈmaʀ | i fʀaˈja ˈsul paʀˈmi ˌtɔθ i kɔʀˈdamn̩/

rouvaç /ruˈvaʦ/ (bank) heist, robbery, stick-up

< 17C, from Middle Boral rouvar “to steal from, to burgle” (now obsolete), borrowed from Germanic; probably Middle Dutch berôven “to rob, to deprive”.

Y fugnt posc y rouvaç valois fort ig un hom parmy connois parolar ne Theudesc.

The getaway after the heist would have gone better, had any of them spoken Dutch.

/i ˈfajnt ˌpɔx i ʀuˈvaʦ vaˈlɔjs ˌfɔʀt aj ɪn ˈɔm paʀˈmi koˈnɔjz ˌpaʀoˈlaʀ ˌne tawˈdɛx/

oho, elements! what elements are known already? what are their names?

  Great question! :D I imagine by, say, 1950 at latest all naturally occuring elements had been discovered (in real life the last such was rhenium in 1925), but I have only fixed the Borlish names of seventeen of them so far. Here we go:

Connuð des aubon dell'hour: / Known since antiquity:

argent - silver
aur - gold
far - iron
cuivr - copper
plom - lead
stan - tin (the above six all from Latin)
azauc - mercury (from Morrove Arabic via Portingale azouco)
brunstan - brimstone [1] (from Old English brynstān “sulfur, lit. burn-stone”, often incorrectly linked to stan “tin”.

Aer: / Airs: [2]

aquifex - aquifex [3], from Scholastic Latin aquifex “water-maker”.
coronal - coronal [4], from Latin corōnālis “of the crown”, referring to the corona of the Sun, where it was first detected.

ignifex - ignifex [5], from S. Latin īgnifex “fire-maker”.

muria - muria [6], from Latin muria “brine, salt liquor”, via muriatic acid.

xanthal - xanthal [7], from Ancient Greek ξᾰνθός (xanthós) “yellow, golden”, with ending by analogy with coronal.

Clað dur: / Stiffs [8]:

adamant - adamant [9], from Latin adamans “unbreakable, hard as steel”.
jast - jast [10], from S. Latin [1] iastum “zinc”, originally from Hindi जस्ता (jastā) “zinc”.
machovin - machovine [11], named for the Machow mine in Poland near where it was first isolated.
natron - natron [12], from A. Greek νίτρον (nítron) “nitre” via Arabic and French, among others.

—

[1] i.e., sulphur. [2] Gases. [3-7] hydrogen, helium, oxygen, chlorine, neon.

[8] Solids. [9-12] titanium, zinc, strontium, sodium

Y Preyer “Nossy Paðr” - The Lord's Prayer

In the modern day, this is one of the most widely-used translations of the Lord's Prayer in Borlish churches, coming from a popular sixteenth-century Bible translation.

Nossy Paðr stant ne ciel
/ˈnɔstʀ‿i ˈpaðʀ̩ ˈstant ne ˈʦjɛl/
sagntfiað sey ty nom.
/sɛjntˈfjaθ ˈsi ti ˈnɔm/
Vin ty reyaum, advin ty grað
/ˈvɪn ti ʀiˈjom | adˈvɪn ti ˈgʀaθ/
cossy ne tar e ne ciel.
/koˈsi ne ˈtaʀ e ne ˈʦjɛl/
Don nos l'oc jorn nossy pan cottidian
/ˈdɔn no lɔk ˈʒɔʀn ˈnɔstʀ‿i ˈpan ˌkotiˈdjan/

/a paʀˈdɔn no ˈnɔstʀ‿i ˈdawt/

/kɔm ˈno lu paʀˈdo no diˈjɛnt/
E dug nos noc vars tentation
/e ˈdaj no ˈnɔk vaʀz ˌtɛntaˈʣjɔn/
ma descaðen nos de mal.
/pi ˌdɛskaˈðɛn no de ˈmal/

The doxology appears in most mainstream Borland churches:

Ke* tien* es y regn, y possenç eð y gloir, siecr siempr ; Amen.
/ke ˈtjɛn ɛz i ˈʀijn | i poˈsɛnʦ ɛθ i ˈglɔjʀ | ˈsjekʀ̩ ˈsjɛmpʀ̩ ‖ aˈmɛn/

*These words are archaic or obsolete in their contemporary definitions in Modern Borlish:

deut “sin” < past participle of deïr “to owe”. Displaced by synonym peccað, and now usually restricted to adjectival senses “due, owed, necessary”.
ke “for, since, because” < from Latin quia with the same meaning. Already old-fashioned at the time this was written, it now survives only in certain expressions. 
tien “thine, yours” < formed after mien “mine” < Latin meum, now also obsolete. The modern construction would be tell'un “your one”.

The first word analysable synchronically as cair “fall, happen” plus the nominaliser -nç, but probably just directly from Late Latin cadentia “result, occurence”. The other words are simple descendants of Latin nivem “snow” and augustus “August”.

Nossy nuçal ant regnbou doblað ny ciel sta un cainç a ney d'aost.

in translation from An Overview of Revitalist Art in Sixteenth-Century Rome, by Safourian Amigòt, published 1870 by Prindor Nicês

By 1550, Rome and the surrounding Italian states had for the most part played catch-up over the last century, with respect to the study of Classical mathematics and science. Having neither the Novomundine explorations of Vascony, Kernow and Morrack to fund patronage of the new inventors, nor the very new medical advances in Denmark (that is, in the Dane Concert) to incite renewed interrogation of Classical medical texts, the various Italian states were further disadvantaged by their unchecked monarchs; and of course, nowhere more so than Rome herself, seat of a papacy that at the time still governed the spritual lives of most of Europe south of Venise.

This is not the place to discuss the causes and immediate political effects of the Great Fracture; for our purposes it suffices to note that, while on paper the Pope in Rome remained an absolute ruler (along with political dominion over several smaller Italian and German provinces), his temporal powers were in practice much diminished. In particular, the venerable prohibitions over blasphemous arts and philosophical publications within the city limits were swftly dissolved by the new Triunvirato, who ordered the obtention of great minds from around Europe; for example, this led to the establishment of the first Brethin House in all of Italy. They undertook this course of action, one assumes, less out of a sincere zeal for scientific discovery (although the personal correspondence of Lord of Houses Josforo Desmono suggests a passing interest in the subject) than a wish to introduce various new political factions into Rome in opposition to the See.

The influx of artists surrounded by scholars of antiquity led to an outpouring of artworks taking inspiration from the great legends of the Greek and Roman pantheons, dubbed in retrospect the Rivitalisto period. Apart from the many paintings and stories (usually retellings of previous myths), probably the most well-known work from this time is I Macchine di Helio (The Machines of Helios) by sculptor Lorenzo dell'Acchedia, a stylised depiction of Helios the Sun and the six known planets gyring around him. The question of exactly where Lorenzo heard about the new astronomical theory remains open: he certainly had enough opportunity in the various city fora…

tegndr /tijndʀ̩/ to soak, to dye, to affect, to influence

< attested as early as 7C in Old Boral as teȝnr et al. “to dye, to immerse”, from Latin tingō “I wet, moisten, tinge” (with possible influence from the derivation intingō “I plunge, saturate”). Metaphorical senses in evidence from 13C.

My ci fraðr e mey tegnsm toð my camis ne roug fosc.

sevrar /seˈvʀaʀ/ [sɪˈvʀɑː] to separate, to split up, to wean (a child)

also mission sevrant /miˈsjɔn seˈvʀant/ injective function, one-to-one map

< 11C; from Vulgar Latin sēperō “I divide, I distinguish”, an alteration of Latin sēparō with the same meaning. Possibly via Old French sevrer “to separate, to sever”.

Sense in mathematics from 1830, in the fundamental work of mathematician Marc Ausbagn, possibly influenced by the existing term mission covrent “surjection”, a translation of the Kentish “covrend (map)”.

Un mission sevrant sevr y sunt ; y ci destegnt accaçað a destegnt.
An injective function separates; distinct inputs are sent to distinct outputs.

The bookseller of Hawthorn Street was a handsome man of perhaps thirty years, and the first time Frederick met him, on a balmy summer evening in 1755, he had (by dint of some quick gossip with his sister) learnt two things about the man: first, he sold books of a higher quality and a lower price than anyone else in Sowbruck [1], or maybe even all of London, and yet always seemed as impeccably maintained as any professional in the borough (despite the reportedly small size of his household); and second, he would vanish for days at a time with little warning and still less in the way of excuses.

Fred had been privately convinced that the man was discreetly employed by the Lord Mayor's office, or by one of the better-concealed deparments of Her Majesty's administration - though bookseller seemed an odd role to foist upon a spy.

taken from the tale A Door, Once Opened by Clarissa Bellamy, published 1920 by Sagittarius Editions

Mr Talbot: Your most recent book has proven remarkably popular, especially for what many would argue is a parachthon [2] story, a genre which hasn't seen much critical success in recent years. It is also somewhat of a departure for yourself, having published primarily in the lovetale [romance] market until now. What inspired you to write this book?
Mrs Bellamy: In some ways I see it as a natural extension of the character development I had worked on before. Really, I had wanted for a while to read para-stories which focus on how people react to the fantastic around them, rather than great battles and politics and mysterious xenozones [aliens]. In the end my husband simply asked “Well then, why don't you write one yourself?”. So I did.

Mr Talbot: You have mentioned that the setting required a lot of research to portray accurately. What drew you to the London of the late eighteenth century?
Mrs Bellamy: I must continually thank my sister-in-law Heleth, who is a historical scholar at the New Lyceum; her interest and counsel were both invaluable to me. Though she focuses more on the Democratic Wars themselves, I found myself more interested in the aftermath, with London a newly independent state, surrounded by uneasy allies and vulture-like enemies, waiting for a single misstep.

Mr Talbot: How would you describe the main moral or theme of your work?
Mrs Bellamy: The most apparent image to me, as I was writing the trevold [novel], was about reciprocity, the idea that any relationship between two people, two places - or indeed two times - is a mutual one. In fact, the title only came after I had finished the first draft; there's a line in one of Davis' plays that goes “A door, once opened, can be stepped through in either direction”. Aside from referring directly to some of the tale's events, of course, I think that quote is emblematic of the relationship between Frederick and the bookseller.

from The Story of Borland (Y Stoir d'Istr Boral), a school history textbook published 1982 by Cordin Editions

Let us compare how the fall of Rome affected Borland and Britain (when we talk about this part of history, remember that Britain refers to all of Albion, not just the Briton states, and not all of them, either). The end of Roman life in Britain occurred quickly during the first three decades of the fifth century. By contrast, although a lot of people did leave Borland for the continent during this time, it seems like the way Borland was a little more independent from the rest of the Empire helped it. In fact, there is recent evidence that some Romans left Britain to Borland, especially from the major cities of Londinium [A19] and Camulodunum [Ð17] (now London and the Merch town of Conster).

At this time, Germanic people, particularly the Angles and Saxons, came from the mainland of Europe and settled in Borland and Britain. In Britain there was a complete shift away from Roman culture over the fifth and sixth century; the Angles established East England [D15] and Northumber [B8] in the east, while the Saxons founded Wessex and Markland in the west.

The story in Borland is similar, but less drastic. Much of the south and west coast was settled by Angle immigrants through the fifth century, where they founded Angland [J11], Southbar [L13] and several more minor kingdoms. At the same time, the informal and decentralised political structures throughout the self-described Roman towns was changing to adapt to the new condition. Several towns in the south were abandoned completely to emigration or assimilation into the Angle kingdoms, and most of the more urbanised east was unified under the rule of Prase Victor Rossetus as the dioces boralis, the Diocese of Boral.

excerpt: The Communication Toolset (El Herramente de Communicazòn) by Joan Bensaíd, published 1951 by Quaterno Theorético a Cordova

In the usual way of things, multiple nations claim the title of the first steeplemesh [5]. The very earliest incarnations of the idea arose during the Democratic Wars of the mid-eighteenth century, but these tended to be single lines of temporary signal towers set up to span terrain that made it too costly to simply send a rider with a message. Moreover, these were set up only to transmit simple messages; for example, an hour to launch an attack.

There were two major developments required for the first true steeplemeshes. First, the means of communication. Early wartime towers usually relied on lampfire and thus were reliable only at night, or else a collection of patterned flags, which were usable at day but required a shorter distance between watchtowers [6]. The two-arm system, allowing up to nine separate states to be transmitted, was probably first tested in the Willem town of Thynen [7], where the church's weathervane was reportedly commandeered to send the first lines of the Pater Noster to the neighbouring town Bost. (Hence, probably, the name “steeplepost”.)

Second, the encoding of a true alphabet, rather than a fixed sets of messages. One early Andalusian attempt (from Cordova to Málaga, usually given as the first line connecting two major cities, and essentially just formalising the signal system that had existed for the duration of their conflict with Morrack [8]) used a variant of the ancient Polybius square as discussed in Chapter 3, adapted for Arabic script. The first modern steeplescript was developed in Cracow [9] by engineer Sigmund Adamich and his son Andrei as part of the royal initiative to connect Cracow to Bitom, using a set of four symbols, traditionally referred to as “dot, dash, bar and hook”.

from The Story of Borland (Y Stoir d'Istr Boral), a school history textbook published 1982 by Hendric Tambour et al. for Cordin Editions

There was a steady influx of Christians into the Diocese of Boral (and later the First Kingdom of Borland) from the latter years of the fifth century, well into the seventh. Early on many of these were Roman or even Celtic Christians displaced by the Germanic migrations, and by the time of Pope Mercury II in 590N, Rome had taken a particular strategic influence in the small kingdom, which at the time was on the defensive against a stronger Southbar [1].

In the first instance, the new Kingdom was viewed as a vital Christian outpost from which Rome could send missionaries east and west to aid the conversion of Albion and the Danes. Thus the early Borlish monasteries and schools of theology were much more outward-focused than the comparatively insular Irish groups. It was to this end that the Golfhaun sanctuary was first erected (with the Latin name Asylum Æstuarii [2], which contains the oldest surviving church building in Borland.

The opinions of the Papacy regarding Borland were as inconstant as the Italian lands it claimed and the men themselves. Many also saw the distant land as a convenient way to make sure inconvenient elements were far away and unable to make trouble. In this way, any given Borland monastery might house semi-heretical monks “entrusted with the conversion of the pagans”, or perhaps several awkwardly-Hellenic men with a suspicious sympathy to one of the Greek heresies.

from The Latin Republics: Jewels under Tyrian Standards by Jacob Trelaune, published by the Yievle Brethin Primers, 1902

Part VI: The Republic of Provence

It would be ahistorical to claim that the republics of the Middlesea were brought about due to the unusually totalist monarchies they neighboured, or even to stake out the somewhat more popular position that those Italian monarchies grew so tyrannical as a reaction to the republics. Nonetheless, one case in which the link between republicanism and totalism is undeniable is with the Republic of Provence.

In the first half of the second millenium, Provence was first a county in the West Francian Kingdom, and following the Emergency at Dijon, the largest province (so to speak) in the Kingdom of Burgundy. The county was elevated under the house of Savoy to a duchy in the thirteenth century, and as the direct link between the capital at Geneva and all of Middlesea sea-trade, it became known as lo panier de Borgogne (the Burgundian breadbasket).

However, with the Novamundine landfall in 1471, and the accompanying Ascendancy of Vascony under Ambrose III, piracy (which had long plagued the very coast which made Provence so profitable, and which was the scourge of the venerable republics of Jeans and Venise, among others) thrived off the general prosperity. In Marsella, the raiding became so frequent that many treated it more as an occupation, and many of the wealthy fled to safer pastures inland.
 
The aid requests presented to Rudolf VIII went largely unanswered. Charitably, one might say he was distracted by the ongoing Bavarn conflict, and the religious difficulty attendant to being the northwesternmost polity yet answerable to Rome. But it is generally allowed that the young king was simply concerned only with himself (or by extension his many lovers) and with resplendent lakeside banquets.

Things came to a head in the last years of the fifteenth century. Lord Daniel Menton of the house of Amigòt had secured the aid of King Marc V of France (France having finally reached reconciliation with Normandy and avoiding the tangle that was the Albion Wars of Fealty), on the advice of the foundling-general Guillen daus Sanz. Thus prepared, he and several other noble families declared independence from Geneva on the twenty-first of June, 1497 (which to this day is a national holiday in Provence). Though this declaration would not be formally recognised until Burgundy's defeat two years later at the Battle of Margès, it was this event which cemented House Amigòt's position as primus inter pares in the new republic.

At least, that is, for the next eighteen years…

The years between Pope Paul I/XI's (Whether or not to include the predecessor Roman Popes, or indeed some other count including any of the antipope lines, was a controversial issue for much of the thirteenth century, so both appellations are seen. The reformist Damien I established that they should not be included, although Paul himself usually did.) first announcing the establishment of a sedes sanctissima in Augsburg and the eventual capitulation of Rome are frustratingly ill-documented, for obvious reasons. Nonetheless, we can reconstruct much of the sequence of events from outside commentary, such as the various Brethin Houses [2] to the west, and the exilic Lombard accounts among the Hellenes.

As we must start the analysis somewhere, let us begin with the 1210 declaration of a renewed Crusade for Jerusalem. It is nowadays usually acknowledged that Pope Just was persuaded to call the new crusade by King…

excerpts in translation from the diary of Nadàlla fi Carol, daughter of the town reverend in Santrafew, an early trading post and latterly a significant settlement in the territory of New Provence.

1590 Nascentiæ

Monday 17th April

Penelope told me this afternoon that there's a nobleman at the docks' lodginghouse, some French fop who's run away from his grandmother. Honestly I'm surprised he survived the crossing; not every such man would last two months with Marco's crew, especially with their new Libyan friends. They'd never have let him hide from work belowdecks, no matter how generous the bribe he gave them for discreet passage…

…moreover, said grandmother is allegedly the Countess [1] d'Avosche! One cannot imagine the scandal of the heir apparent's flight (for he was, we are to understand, to inherit everything) has not ruined her influence over King David's court. No-one has any idea why this mysterious newcomer should have exchanged a chasteau on the Rhin for our humble blankpine rooms on the Becouin.

Wednesday 19th April

Along with the usual bevy of whichever goods the Concert wishes to foist upon the Mastoisèt (Father believes nothing will do as much good for our diplomacy as sending more bronze and iron, or at least more men to mine and smith any we can dig up for ourselves), Marco was good enough to stockpile the Marsella weekly papers, so we have news of the old country for the first time all year. Penelope wants me to read them all to her properly tomorrow morning, but a first glance suggests at least that our heretical cousins haven't yet found themselves on the wrong end of a short rope…

[1] This is Nadàlla's mistake; Avosche was by this time a duchy.

fold /fɔld/ crease, fold, wrinkle

also turning point, waypoint; in literature, plot twist

< 14C, nominal derivation from early Kentish folden “to fold” (or else a borrowing directly from an English noun, since we have no attestation of a Borlish *foldar). The Kentish from Old English fealdan, with the same meaning. Extension to metaphorical senses from 16C; to literature from 1831.

Jo vis un hom aye un fold ag cogn mis d'un fougl a mi plaç pall'oc trevold.

I saw someone had folded over the corner of a page halfway through the book.

parlocar /ˌpaʀ.loˈkaʀ/ [ˌpɑː.lʊˈkɑː] to straddle, to be either side of

< 15C, formed from prefix par- “by, through”, from Latin prefix per-, and from Latin locō “I put, I place”. Although no contemporary verb perlocō is attested, Scholastic Latin had by 1500 readopted it from these later compounds; cf. French parloquer, Vascon pellocar.

Nos entraum ne Rhodos najant, y grant pigl eramn nos parlocant.

We sailed into Rhodes, the great bronze legs on either side of us.

   - overheard on the walkways of Long Street, in the Manster township of Utter Safford, secondmost populous city (the area was recorded to cover 4.4 million people in the 2010 Œcumen Count) in Markland proper.

“Oh wow, Ben! I haven't seen you in weeks - happy New Year! Can you believe the weather we've been having?”

“Carrow! Lovely to run into you - I've actually been downstream in Runkhorn for the festivities, which reminds me, actually, I should have quisted the whole crew by now really - are you and Martha free on Tuesday? We're having a little sorty for Jack's birthday at ours, nothing too fancy. Unless Martha's already planning to spend all night with the Dubliners, of course.”

“Oh I'd love to come down - yeah, Matt's got family in from all over for the light shows, but she probably won't want me embarrassing her in front of the parents in any case, haha! So Jack'll be what, 22 already, goodness - wait, how have I known Jack for a tenyear and not found out his birthday's on Patrick's Day? My father-in-law's called Patrick, I feel as though this should have come up.”

“You've only been married what, six months? And you basically met the in-laws at the altar, if I recall correct-”

“I did not-”

“Anyway, we were always home from school for the Lent break, yeah? He says he can't complain because his sister was born on Sawin, which obviously is even worse, but he's also flanked by all the yearturning gifts and the Eastre baskets, so people often just count those for his birthday.“

"Ouch. Like being born in Marsella at midsummer.”

“Or in Damvath on Christide, exactly. We should see some of the Dubliners' show from the house, though, especially if the Aldreman relaxes the rocketting height restrictions - I bet he will, since the Poolers showed us up so well on New Year's.”

“Didn't they just build a replica of the Ambrosian Steeplepost Tapestry for its two hundredth anniversary? I saw that it took over the local mesh that afternoon, and Mum said one of her friends helped with the construction.”

“It's not just that, obviously, or it wouldn't have been such a big deal! You see, there's a whole story with the canals…”

The former word from Old Boral prow, prof et al. “test, trial”, from Latin proba “proof, evidence”; the latter from Old Boral soldart with the same meaning, adapted with the agentive suffix -art from contemporaneous solder < Latin soldārius “soldier, one having pay” from solidus, a type of coin (see solt “shilling”).

from Handbook of Natural Theory, by Jason Ridley and others, published 1967 in Markland English by the Lincon Collegiate Editors

In mechanics, œculux (commonly referred to simply as light) is a form of propagant lux that carries energy through the barrick extent, most commonly experienced as light or heat. In vacuo, œculux moves at the normal speed, commonly written œ; in more common units, at a rate of 300 dichilomecon per second.

The word œculux is a chimer (to the certain dismay of our more classically-minded readers!): the first half is related to such words as œcumenical “of the secular world”, and here is intended to denote “universal, the entire extent of”. However, its origin is in fact the Greek οἰκουμενικός “the whole world”, literally “the inhabited places”. The suffix -lux, coming directly from Latin lux “light”, is more familiar, perhaps from the new threshold mills and their unsettling martial applications. It is important to keep in mind that luxes aren't just the scary invisible rays from a blacklayer film, but include all the colours of the rainbow.

We conventionally grade œculux by its period, since we interact with it in many different ways.

Light with the shortest periods are scattering, having enough energy to interact with atoms and give them a deficit of plenty; we say the atom becomes deficient. All shortform and penetrating œculux is scattering, and depending on convention some further surblavic light may be included. The maximal period of light which can in theory scatter an atomic base is around 320 trihekimecon, which is still shorter than any visible light. High exposure to light of such brief period is dangerous, and fortunately the atmosphere blocks the majority of such luxes that the Sun emits (although not all, as a sunburn will attest!).

machinal /ˌma.kiˈnal/ mechanical, automatic

< 16C, literally “done by machine”, from machin “machine, engine” + adjectival -al. Noun borrowed 14C from Latin māchina “machine, plan”. Alternatively, directly from Latin māchinālis “of machines”, although the semantic shift is less plausible.

Sy respos sta monoton e machinal, ogl fis a paið.

His reply was monotone and automatic, eyes downturned.

25m Març

calm /kalm/ [kawm] still, immobile, (archaic) calm

also calmar to still, to stop moving

< late 14C, borrowed from Italian calmo, calmare via Old French calme, calmer (or possibly via some Spanish intermediate). Originally only a noun calma “calm, stillness”, from Greek καῦμα (kaûma) “heat, burning”. The semantic shift appears to be “burning > midday heat > rest during the midday heat”, cf. Late Latin verb caumō “I rest in the shade”.

Note calmar does not mean “to calm” as many cognates do (for example, French calmer); for that sense, use keðar < quiētō).

I resgardau e vis y tarnour ponent e calm a cost y sougl.

/i ˌʀɛzgaʀˈdo e ˈvɪz i taʀˈnuʀ ˈponɛnt e ˈkalm a ˈkɔst i ˈsujl/

The bookseller of Hawthorn Street was a handsome man of perhaps thirty years, and the first time Frederick met him, on a balmy summer evening in 1755, he had (by dint of some quick gossip with his sister) learnt two things about the man: first, he sold books of a higher quality and a lower price than anyone else in Sowbruck, or maybe even all of London, and yet always seemed as impeccably maintained as any professional in the borough (despite the reportedly small size of his household); and second, he would vanish for days at a time with little warning and still less in the way of excuses.

…will at least suffice to discuss the transformation of the Order of Saint Hemma of Still Water, commonly the Convoy Australier, from a glorified band of mercenaries to one of the principal military forces under Roman control.

Despite the name history has given the Failed Crusade of the early thirteenth century, the Christian states in the Holy Land were in some ways more secure in their position than they had hitherto been. Nonetheless, it is irrefutable that Pope Just revoking the Convoy Australier's rulership of Antioch and Port Simon in 1208 saved the order a great amount of trouble in the long run. Their subsequent assignment to the courts of Svonimir of Crovatia and Taxon of Hungary meant they were the natural choice to lead the Vatican's grand project to bring Christianity to the Far North, even as the German troubles began to stir…

from “A Baptism of Fire: Christianity and the Graven” by Agata Naziunas, published by Leidéiai Givatés, 1988

…sovravnt nostre deft saȝntaðessem eð atavallessem n iȝ atrevre Golfhavn seȝ hamar dont y Verb divin ismettr a eç povre paian. Peðev soul cy font fallent por vn nov cleȝs d'istroyenç istablir…

Mark considered walking out. Instead he picked up the bottle in front of David and used it to fill the empty not-a-wine-glass in front of him.

David se leyau un sorcegl. “Jo save noc alcohol te toc.”
David's eyebrow lifted. “I didn't know alcohol affected you.”

“I le fay noc,” respos Marc n'engolliscent con gourf lað dy vin. “Pu parveg j'am fort en parformar.”
“It doesn't,” Mark answered and took a hearty mouthful of the wine. “But sometimes I like to pretend.”

Un ricot. Bas, e sincer cos souprendent. “Ða tu desir en parformar, beu lentessem, fros un pog ty laur, figur tu osc y gost, ma noc tan com tu l'ador.”
A laugh. Low and surprisingly earnest. “If you want to pretend, drink slower, pucker your lips a little, pretend you hate the taste, but not as much as you love it.”

“Lonc ty parol tu en a experiç.”
“You sound like you speak from experience.”

“Oc, jo so dou man por m'eurar faus,” promis David. “Par outr, cos allagr, jo so tan dou man por m'eurar ne realtað.”

melle /meˈle/ high society, good company, the activities of the rich and powerful

< Borrowed 15C from Middle French meslee “brawl, confused fight, mixture” variably as mesle, melley, etc. (whether the orthographic <s> which had already been lost in French pronuncation was ever pronounced in Boral is debated). The French itself from mesler “to mix”, from Vulgar Latin misculō, a variant of misceō “I mix”. Original sense of “brawl, tournament (especially one of hand-to-hand combat)” ameliorates to “social gathering, party (in particular, of the aristocracy)” by the late 17C. Modern sense probably influenced by Kentish melee, a later borrowing popular in London in the decades following the Democratic Wars and its independence.

Ostensibly set in the fifteenth century during the Totalist Reaction but depicting utterly-anachronistic politics, foods and technologies (tea, to say the least).

It's not an unusual sight – the Hostess of Perla Solare is one of the more common visitors to the Condottore villa, being responsible for the most successful business in Fontanelli. But usually she should rather visit later in the afternoon, not first thing in the morn.

“Oh, I should have been besieging your door if it were – no, not as grave as all that. Good morning, my lady,” Victoria says, smiling. “One of my girls was about late, and she spotted something on her way home which I thought you should like to know post-haste.”

“Por tant, noc un production tan gra ? Alor certan vos sceust un doncel m'accaçar coll'eç novel ?” rou Claudia, asseyent eð y magð ablegant cant i cour le sarvir.
“And yet it's not as grave as all that? Then surely you could have sent one of your girls to tell me?” Claudia asks, taking a seat and waving off the maid who rushes to serve her.

    lines from the early nineteenth-century trevold Vista Terrena (Earthly Scene), originally published by Antòin Herrel in the Vascon city of Santander. However, it was swiftly banned on charges of indecency (the resurgence of the Modest Arrangement in Spain and Gaul no doubt inflamed by the inevitability of its decline), and the book was only saved due to Antòin's swift flight to Portsmouth, where he changed his name to Tony Smith and republished the story in Kentish (presumably aided in the translation by his companion Hal Brennan). The original manuscript was eventually published in 1870, some years after his death.

antir /anˈtɪʀ/ [ɐnˈtɪː] elder, more old (of people)

e.g. sour antir elder sister; cf. fraðr postir younger brother

    questions taken from the January 2003 N scitation documents for the course 1471 - 1517: War, Peace and Exploration after the Novomundine Landfall, 37st avenue in Concurrence History at the Tremonnow Open School (formerly the Brethin Mesh Institute).

Question 1 (thirty minutes)

Discuss the effect of three new foodstuffs introduced to North Africa and Europe via either (i) the Morrack involvement in Western Cappatia, or (ii) the New Navarre Enterprise.

Question 2 (ninety minutes)

“Perhaps we should have sent for a Kentish witness! They might learn the subtle craft of ending the wars they start.”

- General Guillen daus Sanz on the eve of the Battle of Margès, 1499

Answer any two of the three questions related to the above quote.

(i) A colleague of yours commends daus Sanz and Lord Menton for achieving independence in just two years, noting that in Albion the conflict lasted for forty-six. In what ways might you dispute their characterisation of events?

(ii) The quote suggests that, although Burgundy was not directly involved in the Albion Wars of Fealty, knowledge of the conflict was widespread in Europe. Examine the opinion of any relevant courts (for example, that of Ambrose's Vascony) towards Kent under the Two Henries, and how these impacted Kent's standing between Albion and Gaul.

(iii) To what extent can we say that the Provincial Secession from the Kingdom of Burgundy inspired the development of the principles of Vicinity? You may wish to consider the writings of Jaume fi Gustau advocating for the Doccian language, and, if you have time, compare the Secession to the Emergency at Dijon in 1170 (although this falls somewhat outside the bounds of this course).

    from One Quiet Day by Roberta Bluemore (published in parts from 1939 until 1943 in the Pattinson Issue HM), a retelling of the plot of the 1921 sensation The Day We Let the Chaos In, an illustred trevold collaboration between the siblings Martha and Dean Armstrong. Although, as with most generally-popular works, there were many such derivative pieces published (Markland having at the time an eighteen-year withholding), Bluemore's enjoyed widespread fame, leading to a run on Pattinson's primers and a copy shortage. The full work was edited singly in 1945, and translated into Borlish in 1946 by Margret Courleon.

Ricart zoum, lor mort y carn bou. “Or, y cligs partenent. Dig mey honest – cal pes tu de Fraðr Desmont ?

She snorts, amused. “Of course you were,” she mutters. “I've heard that story almost more times now than the story of his miracle. Oh how humble and pious, how dedicated Sir Richard is, seeking salvation in acts of humility. You are an embarrassment.” Caroline sighs. “You've never been the religious sort. What are you plotting?”

“L'a aer d'y bourg aðelir.”
“He seems good for the town.”

“Casc gent saun ig – alcun hom autr n'a se mis a genoil por luy, malgrað,” dig Carolin, e lor parisc i comprendr ig seyon dit. “Bon Deu, Ricart, vel le deniar.”

Latin cognitus “known, recognised, noted”, perfect passive participle of cognōscō “I know, I recognise”.

1. Vulgar Latin connōscō with passive participle connūtus regularly gives Boral verb connoscr /koˈno.xʀ̩/ [kʊˈno.xɐ] “to know (of), to meet” with participle connuð “known, met”.

    I've not yet come across a stranger man.
    /ʒo ˈne deˈʒa ɪn ˈsiʀ ˌkilaˈjɛsɛm koˈnɪθ/

2. cognitus gives Old French coint, queynt “clever, intelligent” (among other forms), borrowed into Old Boral and surviving to the modern day as queint /kwint/ “intelligent, sophisticated, charming”. (In French we now have quain, quainte /kɛ̃(t)/ “nice, pretty”).

3. The antonym incognitus “unknown, untested” gives Old Italian incognito “unknown” also, “disguised, hidden”, reanalysed as in cognito “in hiding, in disguise”, giving cognito “disguise, hiding”. This phrase borrowed into Old French as en cognite with the same sense, and by 1400 into Middle Boral as ne cognit “in disguise” and cognit /kɔjˈnɪt/ “disguise, hidingplace, secret plot”.

    taken from Middlesea Meals, published bilingually in Wessern and Kernish 1892 by Iscombe Editors. It was translated from the acclaimed 1880 mealbook Pasti Mezziterreni, written by traveller Josforo Sant'Angelo and intersperses anecdotes from his journeys with his favourite dishes.

King James Stew (Frigotta de Rei Jaume)

Of all the fish stews I sampled along the solarium coasts of Barcelon and Provence (not to mention the singular mussel-olive dish I was served on the beaches of Mayurca), none compare to the King James. Locally and affectionately called the jaumetia “little James”, this stew is named for James VI (1691-1749), the longest-ruling monarch in Barcelon since its establishment in 1067. Although similar stews existed in the region before his reign, most simply functioned to use up whatever seafood remained from a day's catch. The King James is perhaps the first such dish made for its own sake, and indeed should for best results use hake or haddock, or a similar whitefish.

Wares (for four)

5ι sweet aumonds
eq. grain garlic, olive oil
1 large onion per cubos
1 whole pepper, sliced
some sweet drypepper, petersly and fendle (fine)
½ pint Empordan or other white
8ι pit shadome or sauce thereof
2п6ι whitefish per frangos
½ limmon, juced

Method

First bake the aumonds until golden and grind to a coarse powder. In a broad pan heat the oil, then gently fry the aumond, garlic, onion and pepper for roughly fifteen minutes, or until the vegetables are soft.

Add the drypepper and half the herbs and stir together. After two minutes add a dram of the wine and allow it to mostly boil off. Now add the shadome sauce or chopped shadomes, pour in the rest of the wine, and cook for fifteen minutes more.

Salt the strips of fish and push them into the sauce. Cover the pan and leave for five minutes, until the fish is just cooked. Uncover, add the rest of the herbs (or whichever amount suits) and cast the juce over the dish. Serve bowled with hardbread.

Nowadays usually either meaning “distant in time” (the spatial sense mostly reserved by lontan) or else the metaphorical “unlikely”, which is first attested 18C.

    scitation questions lifted from Safford Technic Scole's Spring 89 course Along Natural Theory V: Astronomy from Lorenzo to th'Alluning, last in a series following the history of scientific development [reformatted for English.JK]

Answer any number of the following questions in the next three hours.

- - -
Question 2

With reference to Bensaíd's The Communication Toolset, discuss the 1677 global effort to observe the transit of Mercury as an early example of international scientific collaboration.

    Chronicle either the voyage of Danes Gudmund and Rebecca Scradder to the Seldivan court, or the political difficulties at the Observatory at Trapoles under Malik Lisan Al-Mostansir.
    Illustrate mathematically how the threepoint method allowed people to calculate the solar distance using their combined transit records.
    Was it a lack of sufficiently-accurate timekeeping that prevented such an effort during the Venusian transits of the 1630s?

- - -
Question 5

“And all at once Adelaide understood the terrible infinitude cast out before her. She could let the Captain lose her under any xenic sky, and become at once and entirely the most isolated person in history.
The thought appealed.”
- from Through a Black Mirror (1795, Elsebeth Sneider ~ Siegert)

    Describe the state of astronomical knowledge at the time Sneider wrote the above quote, on the eve of the nineteenth century.
    With the conclusion of the First German War in 1770, Saxony was ascendant and controlled more territory than it had at any point in its history. Consider Sneider's writing about the attendant early urbanisation of Lepzi. To what extent did this and her 1772 marriage to Sternkundhaus scholar Otto Sneider influence her writing?
    “The Voidtale fashion reared a generation of star-gazing men and women and thus was ultimately responsible for the cosmic discoveries of the mid-nineteenth century; bint Inám locating the planet Janus, and the normal speed being fixed, for example.” To what extent do you agree with this quote?

< first attested 13C in later Old Boral crullar (possibly 9C ?cunlare “cleave” but this is ambiguous), believed to be from Old English cnyllan “to strike, to knock”. Sense of sound-making established by late 14C; extension to music from 16C. Vulgar sense probably old but only in writing from 19C.

This word continues the habit of transliterating Latin “short <u>” as Boral <o>, on the basis of sound similarity.

In 15C, briefly shifted to mean “zealous, evangelical, stubborn”, but this sense is soon lost to the modern “shy, taciturn”, which dates from roughly the same time.

    from the collected correspondence of Marian Siegert ~ Miller (1725–56), illegitimate daughter of Elias Villingen, second Duke of Far Suebia (the title having been created by King Frederick of Bavarn after the Blue Trans-Willem War and the dissolution of the Kingdom of Burgundy).

[received at Castle Carlsfeld in the winter of 1744]

To my dear brother Thomas,

Albert suggested that I write to you first, and I was only too happy to do so; ideally your witticisms shall be as entertaining on paper as in person, and in any case I cannot help but feel some kinship with you. We are the two fledgeling sparrows cast out from Father's nest to fend for ourselves.

I am of course exaggerating; doubtless the King can provide for any number of wards (no matter how grudgingly accepted; your evenings with Father were perhaps not as private as you hoped! Shall we just say that everyone downstairs is aware of Prince M's Indiscretion?), but neither can I complain overmuch. Albert understated the extent of his cobbler's empire here in Lepzi; it cannot compare to home (as still I think of it) but I had been prepared to face far greater hardships when I accepted his hand.

You were, as ever, entirely correct to insist on extra language tutors (and entirely too generous in letting me attend!). The compulsory Latin has revealed itself less than useless—we run in entirely the wrong circles—but the Dutch they have here is almost as awful as that of those Flemish performers we had in some summers past. I expect I will acclimate, but for now I am having far too much fun speaking Burgund and Boheme with Albert's company.

Does the news we get of bread troubles have any basis? We know not to trust anything the Lepzi weeklies have to say about life south of the Danaw, but the rumours about Venise and Crovatia are bad enough; do abscond back to Stuttgart at the slightest sign Bavarn is along the same track…

Your sister,

F. Marian Siegert

Toð pris accougl, Marc no'r certan de noc faïr y tuyaut recevir, ma ancour l'oc no sta total extrane. Prefaibr untal aucoum par gent aye lou sgardað e pesað a lour y jorn a cortisment meðes, n'y bel per admirant.
On balance, Mark wasn't sure that he wouldn't rather have had the cigar, but there was still something in it. Probably any number of people had looked at them and thought of their own courting days, admiring the handsome couple.

“Vos eð y fest broucað ?” rovau Anna, posc il aurn ci may follað.
“Did you have a nice time?” Anna asked, once they'd walked a bit more.

“Oc fort, vray,” admis i. “Dig le noc a alcun hom.”
“I did, rather,” he admitted.  “Don't tell anyone.”

Y magð scarneu. “Jo vos support may cant vos parformað noc star dessur de tout.”
She huffed.  “You're more fun to be around if you aren't trying to pretend you're above it all.”

I luy dau un sgart fix, e dis sec, “Jo so vray dessur de tout.”
He gave her a sardonic look, and said archly, “I am above it all.”

“No soð vos,” dis i enter serious. “Vos soð paregl com nous autr.”
“No you aren't,” she said, quite seriously.  “You're the same as the rest of us.”

Vuscau vos ayað bon. “Jo promet de noc ig star.”
If only that were true.  “I'm really not.”

I soupirau, pariscent a pognt d'uncos digr, ma se taçoy.
She sighed, seeming about to say something, but chose not to.

They let themselves in quietly, Mark locking the door behind them.  When they reached the place where the men and women went their separate way—and after they'd seen that Daisy and William parted with no funny business—Anna rose up on her toes and quickly, chastely, kissed his cheek.

L'er partið pall'ig scagl domn pre Marc sceus y façon decidr de sy reaction.
She was gone up the women's staircase before Mark had quite decided how to react.

tuyaut /taˈjot/ cigar, pipe, cigarette

also dick, cock

< from early 16C, borrowed from French tuyau “pipe, tube” and immediately narrowing in meaning in Boral. Unetymological <t> is probably hypercorrection, either after borrowing or in the now-moribund Flanders dialect. Pronounced as would be expected in Boral from at least 1689 (cf. Barton), although a former fransc variant is likely. The French from Old French tuial, tudel “pipe”, from Classical German theutō via Frankish thūta “tube”. Related to Merch theet “channel, watercourse”. Vulgar sense in evidence from the twentieth century.

    L'oc bourg a recar dy molin a tuyaut ; lourell'empley, mendrem.

cortisment /ˌkɔʀ.tɪsˈmɛnt/ [ˌkɔː.tɪzˈmɛn(t)] courtship, dating

< 16C, nominal derivation from cortisar “to court, to woo”, a borrowing of the French synonym courtiser, and modelled on Boral cort “court” (or perhaps directly from Italian corteggiare, whence the French). In any case, a verb from Latin cohors “courtyard”, referring to courtly chivalry.

    Vos fal seg monð, ben un annað meðes, por cortisment idone.

    censor commentary on a question from the 1985 scitation paper Consequences of Viking Statecraft, set as part of Lester Academy's series on northwestern European history.

Question 1: What factors enabled Dunclothe in the mid-tenth century to conquer the heartland territory of the Dane Sodrick (also known contemporaneously as the Kingdom of the Isles)?

Censor: On the whole a well-answered question, with the majority of respondents correctly noting the troubles further east - a typical good answer included the following:

    the several famine years during the 920s and 30s across Denmark and Horth (some incorrectly referred to the Eurasian Warming, but this began only several decades later, and in any case did not lower crop yields in the region).
    the skirmishes between Dane-ruled Borland and Sothbar, now harbouring the exilic Roman king and his family (the wife, of course, being King Roderick's cousin).
    the inevitable slowdown of the flow of wealth obtained by raiding; excellent responses compared Sodrick to Danish Jarvick, which managed to transition to a more diplomatic stance by virtue of inheriting (so to speak) a city well-positioned in its trade mesh. By 980 N Jarvick had even successfully reunited Northumbre under its own rule, although Edinbrough and her fief remained de facto independent until increasing Gallic incursion necessitated a more active defence.

Less common but by no means unwelcome was discussion of the Norman French, to whose relative prosperity many left Sodrick entirely; the extent of the depopulation is difficult to quantify but we read several good arguments along these lines. Of particular note is one student; she managed to find convincing records of triplet brothers, born in Mull around 915 N, and mentioned again in reference to a Norman raid of Marsella in 946 N.

It was somewhat disappointing that few respondents mentioned the aggressor Dunclothe in any detail - the lack of decent contemporary sources outside the Tremonnow gravatory does make discussing Roderick's court a challenge. Nonetheless, we appreciated any discussion of, for example, Oscar of Eidin's influence among the northern lords.

platabac /ˌpla.taˈbak/ cupboard, sideboard, chest of drawers

often and traditionally a (necessarily free-standing) item of furniture used to store crockery or utensils, and on which food might be plated before a formal dinner.

< 13C platabac(q) “sideboard, cupboard (often literally a board attached to a wall)”, from late Old French plat abaque “sideboard”, literally “flat board”, retaining a then-rare sense of abaque < Latin abacus “board, abacus”. The mathematical sense of abaque was so predominant that one occasionally sees the reanalysis plat à bac “raftboard” in the contemporary literature, despite the incongruous semantics.

    extract from the Borlish translation of 1981 novel En haut, en bas “Upstairs, Downstairs” by Vincent Margouille, Norman author and former professional lineball player (part of the team that led Kent to its only cup victory in 1965). The story is a period piece set in a fictional manor house late in the Grand-Jeu period; later books in the series follow some of the characters through the Millstone War.

…Meneva (now Tyðewi, or in Wessern tradition Tythew, literally meaning “David's house”), and died on the first of March at the end of the seventh century. He was canonised by Pope Agatho (1001-1026); it is commonly told that this was a signal of Papal support for the foundering Kingdom of Wales, which had been losing people and land both to Markland and to Devon.

The story of Saint David, while interesting, is somewhat tangential to our plot. In the early years of the twelfth century, amidst the great successes of the First Crusade, Pope Nuntius instituted a reform of the heretofore universal Julian calendar. Most relevant to us was the shift of the New Year from the Annunciation on the 25th of March to David's Day, on the first. (In fact, during the Roman period, the first month was January, and to this days certain Eastern heterodoxies celebrate the yearturning at the beginning of that month). It is thus unsurprising that the Welsh New Year celebrations are a global legend. I myself was fortunate enough to be in Deganny for the 200th anniversary of the coronation of the People's King—my hearing has never been the same!

Of course, despite Rome's unparalleled power at this time, not all of Christendom implemented the Nuntian reforms at once. The spiritual significance of the Annunciation proved a particular sticking point; this formed one of the famed Pauline Denunciations—“the reckless diminution of our ordained measure”, as he characteristically put it. Thus did the Augsburg dominions retain the Julian calendar until the Rhine Compromises much later.

The second and more involved change to the Julian calendar regarded the placement of leap years. It had been noted that the equinoces under the Julian system would drift from their astronomical ideal by one day for every 128 years…

tarsc /taʀx/ [tɑːx] card, note, small paper, memo

< 11C from Old French targe “small shield, buckler”, itself from Frankish targa with the same meaning. Probably conflated with the Norse and English cognates, which would alone have given *tarc or *targ. The shift in sense to paper dates to 16C, from clipping of fougl tarsc “buckler sheet”, the term for the paper size one-half of a trevold. Specific meaning “memo” from 19C.

    excerpted from The Secret Guide to Ausbagn (English edition), sold 1967 for 1⍚30 in the Calder Museum of Health's leavingstore [1]. Published first in 1962 on behalf of the Maglen Formeuç Caritativia, as part of a series of tourist guidebooks for cities along both coasts of the Rustigh Strait [2].

…reign, and this at the greatest extent of the First Drengotian Empire in the west. For context, the Ausbagn of the late twelfth century is the de facto seat of the County of Sothbar; by 1190 Count Steven is known to have resided year-round in the coastal town, bequeathing the old house in Heitriç to his younger brother.

The location of Ausbagn on one side of the Rustigh Strait proved to be of immense strategic value, both militarily and economically. The Great Flie Flood of 1171 (which created the island Texel, about which more later) swept away much of Lower Frisland, and was devastating for all of Willemy. This was not least because the Duke, one Lovis the Tall, was in Amstel at the time, and was killed in the deluge [3]. In any case, Ausbagn was for several decades afterward the obvious choice of harbour for any trader moving from the Danish lands through the Drengot domain and onward to Spain and the riches of the Middlesea.

More relevant to history (or at least to the good reader's moneypurse!) are the Order of Saint James, in whose name was built the Peninsular Monastery which overlooks the city. Founded in the tenth century under the patronage of Amelia of Bruges, they were implicated in a popular uprising against Geoffry II and forced to flee to Borland in 1067 [4]. Today the Order (with its modern name, the Jacobin Fraternity) is in the main known for its Jaibos breweries and for owning much of the land around the city, including the site of one of the ancient Roman bathhouses…

    extract from the Borlish translation of We Wake to Broken Windows, by Norman author Mark Deuthex. It was published by Maison Bateller (Ferryman House) in 1973, in the hey-day of the spycraft romance. It draws on the author's own experience working for the Red House in Roun, whose activities were revealed to the public as part of the Furore of 1961. The events of that year led to the collapse of the Drengot Collusion (in particular, Darchild's tinplate government) and eventually to the Kentish ostracon reforms, used as a model in several polities around the globe.

It was sent on Michael's day in 1859 (less than a month after the Auroric Anomaly [1], about which much has been made in film retrospectives), and received manually by Vilmanas' friend Margreta Legaite in Tvaniste – a machine capable of transcribing directly from the steeplemesh having not yet been developed.

A B C D E F G. HAEC TUA PENELOPE LENTO TIBI MITTIT ULISSE.

..be tempting to connect these early developments in distributed communication – so vital to the modern concept of Vicinity – directly to our own tachslates and meshfora [2], but it is important to keep in mind the machinery of the era. Even the self-contained tachygraph was still in its infancy, with most models only capable of setting type at at most half the speed of practised handwriting. The Armanburg Tachygraph (Tachygrafia Armangrod), which was commercially available in Poland from 1842, was so awkward to use that it was lampooned in the bit-sheets as the Bradygrafia (literally the “slow-writer”, tachygraph meaning “fast-writer”).

Moreover, the barrick [electric] steeplepost was still so young that it had not displaced the earlier flag-lamp system, widespread across Spain, Gaul and Italy. With some exceptions (notably the Cracow-Bitom line in southern Poland), the ground was clear for the spread of wired post across northern and eastern Europe, and indeed it is from these places that we get most of the barrick innovations of the late Workshop period (a similar phenomenon is at play in Arabian Cappatia and Lower Mendeva).

lougir /luˈʒɪʀ/ [lʊˈʒɪː] to shimmer, to glimmer, to gleam

that is, to shine intermittently or while flickering

first -ir conjugation, s variant (past participle lous)

< 9C, from Old Boral louger, fouger “to gleam, to flash”, from Latin fulgeō “I flash, I lighten” (see also fourraç “lightning”, from the same root). The initial consonant shift from f to l is difficult to explain, with two main competing theories. First claims metathesis to floger around 6C with subsequent loss of f, although this has holes. More accepted is simply corruption from the similar verb luȝr “to shine” and noun lumnair “light”.

    from Portingale author Ezio Carvallo's 1860 trevold Tejan de Masquira ou Jalico (released in Kentish as We Arive in Unwemmed Clothes, translated 1865 by Christopher Wood), after which is named the originally-Spanish masquira genre of stories. These typically feature vigilante characters and plots driven by hidden identities, high society and complicated schemes. It has some overlap with the later spycraft genre, especially in modern works.

    The narrative focus on characters with hidden identities has led several marginal groups to embrace masquira tales, most notably the semi-public tovarick communities in the Riverine Cities. Indeed, the tovarism connection was barely obfuscated in some works (see particularly Takach's We Will Burn Together), and the popularity of the genre is widely understood to have contributed to the Household Renovation.

…period (a similar phenomenon is at play in Arabian Cappatia and Lower Mendeva).

So the early wired tachygraphs were cumbersome to use and expensive to get hold of – and furthermore there was little incentive for businesses, who could simply hire a tapper [1] already fluent in the Adamich system (a professional could transmit at a rate of two hundred words per minute). Thus was the wired tachygraph adopted slowly, in fits and starts.

However, in those places where there was early adoption, the machines proved astonishingly popular. These were usually dense cities and urban areas undergoing rapid growth. In Safford [2], for example, which already had a robust postal infrastructure, the young Mayor Crawford oversaw the installation of the first redirection banks in post offices. These pioneered the system in which a given missive would be prepended with a borough code – for example, Makerfell's was MKF – allowing the switchers [3] to send the message through to the correct local post office, followed by a house code – eventually standardised to four digits followed by a letter – whence the message could be transmit to the correct machine.

This letter to his editors is on proposed alterations to his magnum opus Roma Æternal: Eç Vascel a These (An Eternal Rome: Ships of Theseus).

(received on the morning of Tuesday 5th November, 1844 N)
Kind sirs Osgaut and Yfaur,

May this missive find you and the Vithor Historical Institute in good health and well-mint. Samuel and Clovia do better for themselves every time they return from school, although their history tutor's opinions on the collapse of the Medieval Imperia are execrable. I expect they shall both be in the melee before this blasted book is published, in any case; Hilgart is already reading the illustrated costumery in the hopes that we might all be fashionable by March (kindly do not mention hats in her company!).

Only two points must I reiterate regarding the volume. First, I absolutely cannot condense The Wall and The Hedgerow – contrasting Hadrian's policies in Britain and in Borland is vital for understanding their different fates in the post-Classical age, for his reign marks the beginning of our island's greater autonomy. There is one correction: I have not been consistent in writing signa (for example in the name of Aquīs Balneīs), and you may feel free to add them wherever necessary.

Second, I would like to divert as much criticism as we might possibly anticipate (in particular one aquiline fellow who shall not sully my quill) and rebut those arguments directly in the text. To this end, might we extend the chapter Twin Keys to emphasise the ways both the Drengotian Constant Empire to the west and the Malchassian Romans to the east used the Church (in the last century of its unity) to support their claims to continuity with Rome? I shall have written the requisite pages by Revillon, I assure you.

Do not hesitate to reply forthwith,
Professor Michael Bervisson

…was thankfully less variation across Europe in these units than in, for example, the league (as we have seen).

§The Second Tetrachy

Refers to the period of roughly one hundred and fifty years for which much of Europe was under the (occasionally theoretical) rule of empire. Known also – especially in older texts – as the Medieval Imperia, or as the Roman Decadence.

The most limited timeframe to which this title routinely refers is from 1091, with the consolidation of Bohemia and Lower Pannonia into the German Empire under Bertholdt II, until 1170, when the Emergency at Dijon led to the establishment of an independent Kingdom of Burgundy (and soon the dissolution of the Constant Empire). More usual is to include everything from the Norman-led subjugation of Kent (and installation of the House of Kernow in Dumnonia) in 1029 to the death of Daniel IV (the Drengotian domains being much divided among his family and friends) in 1191.

The four empires constituting the Second Tetrarchy were:

    the aforementioned Constant Empire, under the Drengot dynasty and comprising for most of its duration the kingdoms of West Francia, Wessex, Markland and Dumnonia.
    the German Empire, in particular under the Houghbrocken and Andex dual imperium, and including more than a dozen states – principally the Kingdom of Saxony, the Duchy of Willemy and the Kingdom of Bohemia.
    the Empire of the Hellenes (also called the Second Roman Empire), especially considered from its territorial maximum in 1026, controlling lands from Corsica to the shores of the Hazaran Sea.
    the Single Caliphate ruled from Cairo, primarily after the centralisation reforms of the early eleventh century (although the further territories such as the Admiralty of Cordoba or the Turkish lands were never as closely-ruled).

Even at the height of imperial control, regions within these states often had significant autonomy. In 1105, the Kingdom of Greater Sicily even went to war with…

…popularised by the works of Dufresne and Fayeda in the last decade of the seventeenth century, this theory asserted that all life had formed at the moment of Creation, and that each successive generation grew from miniature versions of themselves (called by Dufresne zoia, not to be confused with our modern use of the term for one-case life [1]), themselves containing yet-smaller forms for the grandchild generation, and so on. Contemporary diagrams showing a tiny human form inside a spermcase illustrate this theory along with the concurrent idea that the mother was merely the soil where the baby, planted by the father, grew.

Setting aside issues of predestination inherent in this approach—though of course this rendered the theory anathema or even heretical in the Augsburg dominia [2]—the immediate objection (see al-Siddik's 1696 work On the Children of Zeno) was that you would need to posit an infinite chain of progressively-smaller zoia to be present inside every male animal on the planet. There were two broad categories of response: first, Dufresne and many of the more theologically-minded argued that the Lord had merely provided enough zoia to last until the Apocalypse [3]. This argument could never satisfy all, however.

The response more interesting for our purposes is exemplified in Vallakis' 1702 treatise The Generic Impossibility of Self-Duplication within a Bounded Form. In the book Vallakis argues that any organism that can reproduce, or more generally anything capable of duplication, must have a sculptor guiding the division. The argument proceeds as follows:

    A self-duplicating bounded [4] structure A must contain within it all the structures necessary to create a copy of itself, which together we may call B. But then B contains everything necessary to create itself, say C. Thus we must have a descending chain of structures, each of which contains everything necessary to reconstruct the original A. But this is absurd, as A is bounded and cannot contain arbitrarily-small parts. Thus in fact A can divide only under the intervention of a guiding sculptor.

For several decades, thus, mainstream theory held only two opinions on the mechanism of life: either that all life contained an infinite chain of zoia within, or that each time new life was created it was guided in that moment by the plans of the Creator. This state of affairs would not change until the publishing in 1743 of…

(excerpted from Chapter 8, titled Forging the First Link: Problems of Infinite Regression)

…plans of the Creator. This state of affairs would not change until the publishing in 1743 of Fable du Relieur Mut [1] by Rachel Desselut, daughter of explorer and infamous libertine Lord Bouvoin. The relevant portion is reproduced here.

    And yet he could not take Marcuccio as his apprentice, for how was he to instruct a pupil in the art of bookbinding? But although Ignazo could not speak, he could write. For a year and a day he wrote, describing all his methods and arts, from the pedigree of sheep for the parchment, to the age of the oak tree for the ink. In this way he taught Marcuccio in detail the production of a book exactly like the one he had himself written, save that the copy would be utterly blank. Upon the last page, Ignazio wrote his final instruction: Et omnia hic scripta scribas illic—And all that is written here, you shall write therein. And thus Marcuccio received the book, and studied from it. And after many months did he return to Ignazio, twin books in his arms.

Desselut's work lays out the separation of Form and of Method, and how they allow for the unsculpted duplication of a bounded being. However, her work would go unrecognised for nearly two decades (due predominantly to the disruption of the Democratic Wars), during which time she would be forced to flee first to Norman Kent [2] and later to Provence, via Portingale. It was in these years that she first began corresponding with mathematician Raymond al Mustafa, who was at the time resident in Barcelon under the Duke of Aragon's patronage. Their letters offer a tantalising glimpse into early methodics [3], although both were more interested in the implications for life. Desselut inferred the existence of a vital language (in her own writing she called it the Divine Word) present in the cases [4] of the body. Despite later rumours, she probably did not believe this language was literally Hebrew, although she made several analogies in her publications.

In 1770 the first real self-describing book was written by an anonymous author and donated to the University of Hulm. The university has duplicated the book once every four years in as exact a way as possible, and the original, alongside the most recent copy, may be viewed in their Department of Heredity building. In a peculiar twist, since the early twentieth century the ink has had to be sourced from a different tree than is specified in the book, as the…

    recipe taken from the 1763 mealbook A Complete Lithing of the Towns and Cities of Markland, for the Edification of the Good Food Amateur, written by independent traveller Lord Carrow, Baron of Ebbasham [Epsom]. Although popular across Albion, Ireland and Borland (the Borlish translation being infamously inaccurate), it never sold in large numbers on the continent or further afield. His later volumes, An Account of the Vittles of the Various German Peoples and On the Sundry Uses of the Shadome Fruit [tomato], were more enduring, being republished several times even after his death.

The Lonxter [Lancaster] Yatherpot

Lonxter is a castle town on the banks of the Lone, being the northernmost city and river along the western coastline of Markland. Its signature dish is the yatherpot, a filling mutton or lamb meal to be prepared for a large family with its distinctive sliced tartoffer covering. The name is simply Merch for “together pot”, as it is a dish one can cook in a single large pot or bowl.

Wares (for six)
5ι butter or lard
3п6ι lamb or mutton per frangos [strips]
4 sheep's codnere [kidney], trimmed
2 large onions, 6 carrots, sliced
3ι rough flour
some salt, molasses, vinegar, spices per gustibus
1½ pint lamb or chick broth
3 leaves dried lorrer [bay leaf]
3п6ι tartoffer, peeled and sliced

Method

    Melt a little of the butter in a large shallow dish and sear the lamb in batches, remove to a plate, then repeat with 3 trimmed and sliced lamb kidneys, the onions and the carrots (these last two remaining).
    Dust with flour, leave for two minutes, then add the seasoning and broth, and allow to boil. Pour in the lamb, kidneys and lorrer and remove from the fire.
    Arrange the tartoffer by slices over the meat and then glaze with hot butter. Place on a lid and cook for 1+½ hours on a low fire.
    Once the tartoffer are well-browned, remove from the fire and serve immediately.

    scitation questions (in translation) from the  University Faculty of Domain History, from the course Religion in the Second Millenium: Belief, Community and Division, given Summer 2007 N following a reconfiguration of their course offering.

Question 1 (60 minutes)
Write a short speech aimed at the interested layman advocating the three religious developments of the last millenium in Europe which you hold to have been most influential. You should introduce the events with appropriate context, discuss their similarities and differences, and justify their importance. For example, you might choose one of

    the German Secession; the Great Fracture; the Deviance Movement

    the First Crusade; the Muslim migrations northward into the Russias and Tartary; the Prodigal Faiths from Mendeva and Cappatia

Question 2 (120 minutes)
This question focuses in particular on the emergence of Deviance Theology (the Anti-Paradise Movement) in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

(i) What evidence is there that <Deviance> originates as a mistranslation from Wessern, and meant at first <defiance, rebellion>? Consider both the semantic plausibility and—crucially—the significance of <defiance> to the Promethean clubs across Albion; the term of course is better evidenced in their Danawan counterparts.

(ii) In both Albion and the Danaw Kingdom at this time there were significant religious minorities and the Church (of whichever stripe) was strongly associated with local authority. Was it these commonalities that made them fertile ground for Anti-Paradise thought?

(iii) To what extent was the resurgence of the Modest Arrangement in Spain and Gaul in reaction to these new religious ideas? Compare the fervence of Modest thinkers like the Marquis de Caillat or proto-Blue Marian Diana Theodora Queiroz to the philosophers of earlier Modest-like movements.

(iv) In your opinion, who is, or are, the most likely author(s) of the incendiary 1799 publication Et Nous Amerons les Fux (And We Will Love the Fire), a seminal work in Deviance Theology? Back up your theory with modern and contemporary sources, and contrast the likelihood of at least two other candidates.

abanc /aˈbank/ [ɐˈbaŋk] landing, landfall, arrival

< early 15C, deverbal of earlier abancar “to land, make landfall, dock, beach”, itself an early Old Boral verbal inchoative derivation from banc “riverbank” (later “bench, seat” due to influence from continental Romance languages).

14th October, 1950

…welcomed back from the New Cambrick facilities; Captains Kerry and Montpiu landed safely at Fort daus Sanz early Friday morning.

REVIEW: Zachariah

A departure from Kiawaman's usual fare, this blacklair [horror] tale takes us back to the 1820s amid the disintegration of the Long Peace and the beginning of Reaction War. From the gaslit streets of independent Boxa [~Novi Sad, Serbia] to the recovering shell of Stamboul [Istanbul/Constantinople], this adaptation of Petcov's classic trevold [novel] Majat vCherveno (The Red Man) tries to recreate the dread and mystery of watching our four heroes slowly discover the true nature of the eponymous Zachariah.

Unfortunately, the beautiful landscape shots and the addition of a rich Tavancine tourist (whose plotline is mostly borrowed from the book's Elenor storyline) are the high points of an otherwise messy film. In an attempt to incorporate some of the more traditional aspects of vampire folklore, Kiawaman grants Zachariah mystic powers and has the heroes defeat him by means of a sanctified wooden stake (not, as in the book and in popular wisdom, by burning). These new powers, in the hands of a better writer, could have set up a dynamic between Zachariah and Vania as artists of the same craft—instead, we are given the tired trope of a woman torn between the affections of two men. It doesn't help that the audience barely believes there is any choice to make; Vania has no chemistry with either lead.

The symbolism of fire and butterflies that permeated the book is also entirely absent from this adaptation. Apparently afraid to present Zachariah as light or good in any way, we get a cold manor house and bat-infested (!) roofs. Never mind the rich history of the vampire as a figure clinging to life in all its forms, in the blood of the living, in the dancing flames and in the metamorphosis of the butterfly. The film relies heavily on gory fights (with what is clearly wine as a bad stand-in for blood, in a disappointing reversal) and a pounding orchestra who leave the few quiet scenes no room to breathe.

This will be no classic: come only for the views (of beautiful forests, and a bevy of handsome actors, I concede) and two hours of mindless tragedy. - Jacint Brunat

Albion and Ireland, 1028 Nascentiæ

This year is the last in pre-Drengotian Albion. 1029 will bring the Kernovan Conjuring and Norman Accession, and the succeeding decades will see what might have been the new steady state of these islands disintegrate.

In the south, Kent under Rodulf is stable and much expanded from its position in the 9th and early 10th centuries, having subdued Wessex (minus Anglia, already lost to Markland in the Treaty of Oxford) but suffered renewed Dumnonian pushes from the west. Canterbury's most powerful vassals lie to the north in Essex across the Thames, ably run by Alfred the Tall. The elderly patriarch Rodulf of Kent lingers on his deathbed after eight decades of political manœuvring.

To the west we have the ever-fractious kingdoms of Ireland, lately unified as but four (with the breaking of the Ultagh in the north-east): Tyrconnal, Connaght, Lenster and Munster. The tales of Tyrconnal and Lenster are dominated by wars at once with the Norse to the east and the other Irish to the west, while the houses of Connaght and Munster vie for the position of High King of Ireland.

The north holds the confederate Kingdoms of the Danes, newly untethered from overseas rule. The once-mighty kingdom of Northumbria is rendered but one province of the whole, yet the city of Yorwick remains the richest city on Albion (thanks to economic ties in all directions). Still more northerly lie the two-minded Kingdom of Scotland and the last remains of Horther rule in Albion persist in Orkney and Shetland.

Between all these we find those bitter rivals, Markland and Wales. Cadwallan, erstwhile king of Wynneth, finds himself the unexpected ruler of all Wales—a fortuitous position of strength against equally formidable Markland under Oswin the Becoming.

    taken from the 2008 fourth edition of condensed study materials for New Vithor course Histoir Concorrent, s16 : Mort, Vascel eð y Motion Celest (in English, Concurrence History of the 16th Century: Death, Ships and the Movement of the Heavens).

…it is usual to consider the feudal system entirely defunct by 1550 N, at least outside of insular nations like Burgundy or Awry. There were a variety of reasons for this collapse, some more widely accepted than others.

Often cited is a labour shortage of serfs due to the Second Great Dying, allowing those peasants who remained to demand more favourable conditions from their lords. This is evidenced by the correlation [Iscombe 1967] observed between population loss and liberalisation (as well as how quickly the nascent middle class grew). For example, Borland under Joseph III lost over four hundred thousand people, one-seventh of its population; serfdom (already on its last legs) was legally abolished in 1564 N, but by that point it had not de facto existed on the island for a generation.

One counterexample to the above trend is Vascony, which, thanks to Novomundine profits in furs and other goods, actually saw in increase in population from 1500 to 1550 (excluding Portingale) due to immigration. The end of the Vascon Ascendancy with the War of the Two Queens would end feudalism in Vascony by the end of the century, however.

(It is worth mentioning that this was not the main factor in ending feudalism in the east, where the Islamic conquests of Kiew and Russian Cazany upended the nobility more directly.)

One, perhaps unexpected, effect of the decline of the feudal system was the strengthening of laws such as sumptuary codes. These were intended [Rone, 1988] to reinforce the social distinctions between serf, freedman and noble—although states had had similar laws almost since Classical times, enforcement of these rules became more stringent and draconian. There is even one account of an Emma Chasteron being executed in Dovres for wearing “silk in saphires purpel and petal embroderie” to church…

…as in the writing of physician Dr Mickel Cráyenschot, noted for being an early supporter of Deviance Theology and public tovarick in France even as it embraced the Modest Arrangement.

But the application of copper's counter-zoic [anti-microbial] manner with the furthest-reaching consequences can only be the stauron retainer [intra-uterine device]. Nonetheless it is important to separate our modern point of view from the contemporary. What seem to us like obvious components of the retainer often took dozens of years to innovate. For example, the T-cross of the modern retainer doesn't arise until the St. Agrippina Medical House 1877 patent—earlier designs included rings and helices!

The theoretical barrier to developing this kind of prevention was recognising that copper metal could kill sperm cases as well as zoia. Although copper's counter-zoic manner had been documented since 1789 (see the work of alchemist Suxúmawaca bint as-Sáffat), extending this observation to sperm would have to wait until 1824, in the aftermath of the Second German War. Former mozardisto and farm theorist Ricardo Ivarrachezurí wrote in that year that “the seed of the bull, the ram and the stallion alike are made impotent in storing them for some hours in a syringe of copper; in this we can suppose we see the same mechanism that dispels the cholera from water in a copper cauldron”.

In fact, Ivarrachezurí published these findings as a warning to other farmers and horse breeders not to use copper in their fecundation projects…

< first used in Borlish in 1890s N, based on Vascon retenor stauròn or possibly Romish ritinore stauron; analogous terms had been in the scientific literature since the 1876 Sant'Agrippa publication. The noun is an agentive from retenir “to withhold, restrain, keep, preserve”, literally “hold again”, itself modelled after Latin retineō “I hold back, repress, protect”. The adjective, meaning “cross-shaped”, is from a mock-neuter form of Ancient Greek σταυρός (staurós) “stake,  crucifix”.

    from the collected study notes for the course 1471–1517: War, Peace and Exploration after the Novomundine Landfall, 37th avenue in Concurrence History at the Tremonnow Open School.

Of course, Vascony was not the only nearby state attempting to reach Asia by sea. Ambrose's nemesis Munir al-Hamdawi of Morrack had in 1463 established a rival marine enterprise in the New World Company (شركة العالم الجديد), and just five years later the ship Orion (الجَبَار) voyaged from Anfa [Casablanca] to Aden. They made port in Vascon Sant Adrian [Bioko] and encountered Chinese merchants in Mombasa, whose reports to the Southern Emperor would change the course of history forever (see 1524-1600: The Collision and the Fracture).

After the Landfall, the Company's efforts were swiftly redirected to the Novomund [the New World] (as were the naval efforts, however paltry, of most of Europe at this time). However, a notable exception was the relatively-new Kingdom of Britain, where Howel's ships had already set up resupply ports along the African coast. Having profited from the ongoing Wars of Fealty which raged across the rest of Albion [Great Britain], the king was convinced more opportunity lay in connecting the European market directly to Asia. Doubtless he also wanted to displace the Borlish supremacy in the northern trade (although this ambition would not be achieved in his lifetime).

In any case, the tale of the twin voyages of the Cynthia and the Phœbos (of Morrack and Britain respectively) remains to this day one of the greatest stories of exploration and discovery the world has ever known, measuring up to Homer's Odyssey and Quoming's Peoples of the Sea. Directed by Umanick and Chinese traders, mac Kellot's Phœbos sailed to Gurjat, Madray and eventually made port at Borune in 1516. This was at the time almost the south-eastern extremity of the known Vetomund.

Meanwhile, the Cynthia under al-Casmi (himself a Persian immigrant to Morrack) had no less interesting a journey…

       from the collected study notes for the course 1471–1517: War, Peace and Exploration after the Novomundine Landfall, 37th avenue in Concurrence History at the Tremonnow Open School.

…the south-eastern extremity of the known Vetomund.

Meanwhile, the Cynthia under al-Casmi (himself a Persian immigrant to Morrack) had no less interesting a journey. First making port at the various Arcabil and Meridian outposts, already a significant source of wealth, the ship continued along the Cappatian coast*. Here in al-Casmi's logbooks we read of the Dowahin straits and island (from the Arabic for “smoke”, after the many smoke-towers the captain writes of seeing the inhabitants of the island build, and which dissuaded him from making landfall thereon).

(*Remember that the continent would not be so named for several more decades yet.)

But the bulk of the Cynthia's journey would come next, as the ship entered the southern Horizic Ocean. At first they sailed north along the jagged coastline, possibly as far as Maboutian lands, although al-Casmis records are unclear. In any case they eventually sailed west into the blue. It is not entirely clear which Horizic Isles the Cynthia encountered on this part of the voyage. What is known is that on midsummer of 1515 they alighted on Jazirat Asnam (the encounter being infamous for its acrimony), and that on 11 Shaban 921 the crew began to perform the salat forward, not aft, as the astronomer aboard—one Taisir as-Sadik—predicted they had passed the longitude of the antipode of Mecca.*

(*Further recall that truly accurate longitude measurement would not be achieved until the invention of the timehold in the mid-seventeenth century.)

The next spring the Cynthia finally arrived in a place almost recognisable as Asia, though the inhabitants were as dark-skinned as anyone in the Arab world. This archipelago was hence named Asia Cahal (or in modern parlance Cahalla), and in the records of al-Casmi's time on Bijai (the largest island thereof) there is an account of an old folktale; one which will explain why the Cynthia, on leaving Bijai, went not west, but south…

triant parmig /tʀiˈant paʀˈmaj/ for example, as an example

This from late Latin trītō “I chop, rub”, with meaning shift through use in granum terere “beat the corn from the chaff”. The adverb parmig derives from parmy “among, alongside”, literally “by the middle”, from Latin per medium.

    She was infamous during her later life for her great influence in the court of David of France, with rumours that she was in fact his mother persisting for the rest of his reign. The 1589 scandal involving her eldest grandson Déricque temporarily cost her some capital, and although she soon regained her position, King David took the opportunity to continue the centralisation policies typical of contemporary Europe.

…we will perhaps never know if the conquering Romans called our land īnsula boreālis “Island in the North” before they arrived in force at the daybreak of the first millenium, or if the name is a post hoc creation after the native Kelt name, enis borag “Island of the Dawn” (so called for its easterly position with respect to Albion and Ireland)…

…there remains little outside contemporary Roman accounts of the Bora Ale, the Borland Kelts, bar geographical features such as the river Duðam (from du dammo “at the river”) and, possibly, personal names such as Ivocq and Haðr (though for most of these we also have alternate explanations)…

…in Ptolemy's description of the Pritannoi we can understand he referred to the entirety of the Insular Kelts as a whole; this grouping was later divided, first by the English Strait at some point before Caesar's first invasion of Albion, and later by the Irish Sea, although of course this neat partition is confused by the Scots and by the Welsh communities along the Rustigh…

…the latter years of the eighth century, as the Viking Age dawned. The last purely English war of the time was the Merch subjugation of East Anglia, simultaneously establishing the Great Border between the mouths of the Severn and the Thames (see the Oxonian 796 N chronicle), and inciting a renewed influx into the petty kingdoms of Angland and Southbar…

< 13C in late Old Boral suȝtour “suckler, one who breastfeeds”, nominal derivation from suȝtar (modern sugtar) “suckle, breastfeed”, a direct descendant from late Latin sūgitō “I suckle”. This is a derivation apparently exclusive to Borland from sūgō “I suck, take in” (see also issugt “dried, boring”, from the same root).

Presumably somehow related to Latin cōnsobrīnus “first cousin”, whence Norman quosin, Vascon cotrì and Romish coginne, for example. However, influence from Old English swēor “father-in-law, cousin” is almost guaranteed.

    start of a letter sent in 1828 via steeplepost from Pentrose (a port town on the south coast of Borland) to Axton (a rapidly-growing industry town which at the time was located in French Guillenne [1], in the duchy of Avosche, known to Paris as Grand-Aix).

    The Rustigh Strait postal crossing from Ausbagn to Texel was not yet connected with air-steeples. In fact, the eventual connection only lasted a generation or so before a barrick line [electric telegraph cable] was laid down—one of the first such lines, beaten by Dovre-Caleis, which were successfully joined in 1852.

To the inestimable Niklás de Fecht,

Or should I be saying Nicolas Defechet, perhaps? You will at the very least do me the service of not moving to Paris, city of greed and carrion [2], even if you must learn some Proper French for the sake of your wife. (I have always preferred the Roun standard on aesthetic grounds, although I cannot entirely forget politics even here!) As Hortense is certainly reading, I shall pass on Clara's well-wishes and reiterate that you are welcome to make use of the Vauhan lencorve [line of credit]; just ask for Marduth at the Tyche Bank.

Pether's lot are also destined, it seems to leave fair, perfidious Albion. Despite my continuing assurances of welcome here they are determined to sail the great Mendevan river to whatever future they can find in Hasiny [3]. I must admit the prospect of being thousands of miles from any Dutchman has its appeal. (Forgive me! The last decade has made provincials of us all—mayhap even Provincials! [4])

The library has finally provided me with Dümmeyer's treatise on collection and delivery; I will not appease you by pretending to have read it, but be assured I will find the hours for it this very week…

[1] Corresponding approximately to Alsace, Lorraine and the Netherlands.

[2] The Kingdom of France was seen to have profited unjustly from the Second German War, gaining significant territory while (according to many) not investing much manpower or material resources.

[3] A Mendevan [North American] state now legally separate from Britain [a state comprising Wales, Devon, Kernow and parts of northern Ireland and Albion], corresponding roughly to East Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and western Mississippi.

…library has finally provided me with Dümmeyer's treatise on collection and delivery; I will not appease you by pretending to have read it, but be assured I will find the hours for it this very week! Dear Johan insists it is all atmospherical and futile nonsense, but then Johan trusts no mathematics since Craddock's book on distance room. Honestly I'm surprised he consents to use even the mechanical methods, but I suppose he isn't quite bone-headed enough to make his workshop designing more difficult for himself.

Have you any plans to go south this summer? I hear they shall reopen the arena in Verona to performances—they say Bruno's Wings Afire will be the first shown there since the war! I had the pleasure of knowing her brother Jacom before she was ever known to the wider world (apparently they are astonishingly similar in appearance, even for twins); we fought together at Hulm in 21. That was an astonishingly-mismanaged offensive and in all honestly prolonged the war for months, but I mustn't start this rant, or I will never end.

Jacom had nothing but praise for his sister and their parents, in any case (although the desire for a warm bed and the call of peacetime Furlain no doubt inflenced his recollection), so I cannot do anything but recommend the opera to you. If in the end you hate the singing you will at least have the pleasure of restored Roman architecture!

Your friend,

Presumably a haplologised form of Latin findentia “a cleaving, a splitting” (stress shifted in Borland Latin to initial, as in all third-conjugation verbs), nominalisation of findō “I split, cleave, break up”.

    excerpted from 1997 academic textbook Del Christianizamento dell'Isole Norroveste (On the Christianisation of the Northwestern Isles), written by historian of mediæval religion Dijaca Rofotto, working as a researcher and archivist for the Librario Soprano (Sovereign Library) of the Autonome University of Saint Marinus.

…survived, however, in those few remaining monasteries spared from the Danish raids (note in particular the Chronicle of Carlile, which survives only in copy at the Tremonnow Brethin House, having presumably been ferried across the Irish Sea before the monastery at Carlile burnt down in around 1013 N).

But to understand the final years of Wulfstan the Younger of Northumber, we must look two centuries earlier, to the very first Viking raids on the shores of Albion and Ireland. The tales of similar raids on Borland towns—and on monasteries in particular—would surely have been common knowledge by the time they spread westward, sacking Halgrive in the summer of 764.

Nonetheless, the English kingdoms were prepared for these raids (and eventually, invasions) to vastly different degrees. Compare the fates of Merch Lincon to Northumbrian Yorwick: the former never fell, and in fact became the most heavily-fortified town in Markland for the several decades it served as the de facto border of Danish rule. In part this was the inevitable result of tensions along the Welsh border; even during the relatively-long period of peacetime both Theodric the Awefast and Owain of Brochwel maintained ever-more levy forces to police the long Severn Line.

By contrast, Yorwick almost gave itself over to Dane rule. Though convincing records are either fragmentary or clearly biased (even Brethin writing in this period cannot be entirely trusted), it is generally believed that the alderman's court threw him out pre-emptively as a sop, hoping to offer enough treasure freely to the invaders that they could avoid a total destruction of the city. Yorwick's key economic position within Dane-ruled Albion in the next century certainly suggest these efforts were not unsuccessful…

    excerpted from David Huhn's economic history textbook Stadstahten: Sichrer Haven (City-States: Safe Harbor), a treatise on the role of independent trade cities in the development of mercantilism. The book was published in 1923 with funding from the Lunburg Schazhaus.

…close of the thirteenth century as a convenient cutoff. The fiction of a surviving German Empire was laid to rest with the corpse of the first Kingdom of Saxony, with the domain of the Hoghbrocken dynasty reduced to their core lands upstream in Lepzi and Magdeburg. The newly-reduced Margrave Baldur of Saxony, being only 4 years old at the time, was understandably outmanœuvred by the nascent Stadbund.

But the guild-states known variously as the Stadbund, the Samslutning or the North Collision (we see in Latin documents usually collisio theodisc) did not, of course, appear fully-formed at the dawn of the fourteenth century. We can trace the roots of intercivic contracts restricting tariffs, tolls and other fees back to the early twelfth century. Indeed, even at the height of the Mediæval Imperia, traditionally portrayed as a world (or a least a Europe) of central authority, mayors of the towns in the low Elbe and its tributaries were collaborating independently of their respective lieges.

We must look at early Bardwick, which along with Hamburg and Lunburg comprised the founding core—and later the trading heart—of the Stadbund. Its particular interest stems from its dual position as court of the Hoghbrocken kings and as a highly mercantile trade city. King Ruprecht II in particular will serve as a useful…

    extract from the first chapter of the Borlish translation Hom ne Gahað e Diamant (Men of Jet and Diamond, or Dynnon o Vuhuð a Diamont in the original Cambrick) released in 1952 by the publishing arm of the Peujon Rous media guild. The original masquira tale was published in 1890, but achieved little notoriety in Europe before the New Provincial film adaptation Blanc Sabaje (Jet White) in 1951.

“Soð vos ac por l'avent dy Rey novel a Nadacou veir ?” Un hom haut e slanc colluïsc Zoe sur y pladisc, remplisc peðent all'hontarn con saluð.
“Are you here to see the new King arrive in Nadacow?” A tall, slender man joins Zoe at the bar, signalling the tender for a refill.

“Not to see His Grace, per se,” Zoe demurs, taking the opportunity to turn and look properly at her new companion. Dark hair, closely-shorn—not typical among those with long family ties in the area, though his complexion suggested he wasn't entirely foreign.

< in Middle Boral from 14C, verbal derivation from reit “rigid, stiff, solid” with factitive suffix -fiar < Latin -ficō. The adjective comes regularly from Latin rigidus “stuff, rigid, inflexible”. Some semantic bleed from rectifiar “to straighten out, put to order, rectify” seems likely.

    in translation from 1970 historical review Conjugation, Operation e Diabolica in Musica : Y Commouð Deviant Primal (The Early Deviance Movement), written by Borlish popular historian Catrin Veçount, published to coincide with the hundred and twentieth anniversary of the Laic Declarations.

…no greater irony than that Sneider herself despised Anti-Paradism, as evidenced by her public remarks, the devotion of her later trevolds and, for example, the following quote from a letter to her sister, written in 1821:
    “It is not only their strange ideas and lonely, nihilist universe, dear Thifäne, but that so many of their number have approached me as if I were their most natural ally!”
    Indeed, Durgh'nen Shorzen Shouer was perhaps more likely to appear on the bookshelves of any given radical than even Les Fux, having a far more easily-deniable significance to the movement…

…most often-overlooked is music. Plausibly this may be a victim of its own success: until the latter half of the century no part of Anti-Paradise Thought was as popular as its composers. Granted, not many were so blatant as Cráyenschot (son of physician Mickel), who in 1814 published Ad Pentaculum, an opera marked entirely in five. The music of Deviance composers emphasised emotion and the manipulation of the audience, and listeners from Deganny to Baldran found themselves enchanted…

…notoriously-Modest Vascony was numbered. Perhaps no other country was so entirely transformed by the ending of the Long Peace. Although at first the Vallabrì administration managed to watch the Second German War from afar, once its interests in Mendeva and the East were threatened, King Hernand had no choice but to declare for the Convoy.
    The dryhdu herself has ensured the tale of Antòin Herrel (Tony Smith) has lately entered common knowledge, but his
experiences in Devon and Kent are still worth repeating here. In particular, his friendship with Arteth Vyhn…

The noun is a direct descendant of Latin mundus “ornaments, decorations” via a Mediæval Latin sense “universe, world, mankind”. The verb is also straightforwardly from Latin crēdō “I believe, trust”.

Irregular lowering of long <ū> not completely explained but long vowels were in any case rare before <rC> clusters. The adverb became obsolete by 15C but was reintroduced to common speech by its use in popular historical trevolds in the late eighteenth century.

    excerpted from Borlish book Lugnt Ros Sur Ont Lugnt (Rosy Dawn on Glittering Waves), a popular account of the development of seafarers since the 1471 Landfall. Written by amateur historian Descard Ausogn in 1929, it was criticised for its uncritical view of pirate culture, and in particular his depiction of their role in the Romantic Wars.

…example of early international cooperation, the Bordew-Audaz canal was finally completed in 1679, following over a decade of delays due ultimately to Vascony's losses to Andalus in the south.

These great infrastrusture projects characterise the Romantic period, although these decades would not gain that appellation for another century. The name is first used after the Democratic Wars, when the latter half of the seventeenth century was seen, nonsensically, as the last golden age of refinement and civilisation. It is hard not to contrast these insular, squabbling European states of the 1660s with, say, the great geoscopic voyages of mac Kellot and al-Casmi of the previous century, or the renewed Novomundine interest of the next.

Nonetheless, it is in this time that we can see the familiar modern map begin to emerge across Europe. The shape of Vascony begins to stabilise at last, and to the east the German marksmen and great mayors contemplate, perhaps, the idea of cooperation. Even the fractious religious politics further south threaten to give way to the more secular animosities of popular unrest and land grabs.

In particular, Naples finally finds itself unshackled, neither from defunct Greek imperial rule, nor from the heathens of Sicily, nor from the Papal embrace of Rome. With this context King Ladislau's obsessive focus on military strength, and in particular the Marina Ottima, seems entirely reasonable…

The word gra “need, benefit” does not retain those meanings in modern Boral (keeping only “extent, degree, importance”), and is itself probably a contamination of Latin gravis “heavy, serious” by grātus “pleasing, agreeable, beloved” (which gives modern grað “will, wont, way”).

tegnt visacer /ˈtint ˌvi.zaˈtsɛr/ [tɪɱˌvi.zɐˈtsɛ:] complexion, facial appearance

< 18C, literally "facial tint", first used in the early ethnographies translated into Boral. The noun tegnt "tint, shade, colour, dye" is from the Latin tinctus "dipped in, treated, coloured, tinged", past participle of tingō "I wet, moisten, dip, immerse" (whence Boral tegndr). The adjective is a standard derivation from visaç "face, visage", from Old Boral visazȝ "face, regard, look". This is as if from Latin *visāticum, though it is likely a later derivation, from vis < visus "look". Justification for the retention of short <i> is unclear but forms with <e> are entirely unattested.

FILM IN REVIEW
- Hωn a Kyvodoð (The Ascendant), in odyssey from the 7th of July

I shall be honest—the timing of this release so soon after the solstice perhaps let me better indulge the obviously-propagandist elements of Dormaget's latest historical courtly drama. The Vascon Ascendancy is no new ground for the screen, with Agochino's more personal Sou Ambroxo (I am Ambrose) defining the popular perception of Vascony's longest-reigning king. Nevertheless, I find The Ascendant to be a charming retelling of those turbulent years after the 1471 Landfall, not least in its choice to focus on the more minor personages of Ambrose's court.

As an example (though her Vask is terrible in the few scenes they stray from Cambrick), Lyneth Madox plays Jata, the seamstress-wife of an Enterprise sailor. It is through her eyes that we can understand the whole of the city of Bilvaw as it is changed by the Crown's attentions. Throughout, Madox gives Jata a steel resolve and implacable practicality sadly lacking in today's usual dramatic protagonists.

Domaget uses the narrow view to illuminate the broad in every aspect of his filmmaking, and we really see the benefits of such an approach here. If the scenes were confined to the palaces and castles of Huzatre and Cartaw, it would be hard to connect the Welsh tangles in Albion (one does rather wish the film had spent less time on the Wars of Fealty, but such things are inevitable when Britain sets a film in the fifteenth century) to the second marriage of Alexandra of Vascony and her famed voyage. Instead we can feel the sense of parental obligation warring with wanderlust in both threads of this filmic tapestry.

The Ascendant will doubtless be a staple of the summer screen, and it well deserves the honour. For the best experience I recommend you spend the afternoon drinking Empordan and singing as many songs of glory as you can think of.

    excerpted from Part VI: The Republic of Provence, from The Latin Republics: Jewels under Tyrian Standards, a history of the mercantile republics on the Middlesea from 1000 to 1800 N written by Jacob Trelaune and published 1902 by the Yievle Brethin Primers.

…would not be formally recognised until Burgundy's defeat two years later at the Battle of Margès, it was this event which cemented House Amigòt's position as primus inter pares in the new republic. 

At least, that is, for the next eighteen years of manoeuvring against a hungry Barcelon and their piratical allies who de facto ruled Marsella (it is generally understood that Lord Amigòt [Daniel Menton] established Marsella as the capital of Provence in large part to closely monitor Jondumal's fleets, about which see Part III: Old Jeans). By the end of his rule in 1517, Lord Amigòt had solidified the borders with Burgundy and Barcelon, with Narbona left with double obligations to Menton and to Jaume III.

It is also supposed—Amigòt did not do us the service of keeping a chronicle—that his rule lasted eighteen years to allow Menton to ensure his chosen successor enjoyed near-unanimous support of the Concert, the Provincial legislative house modelled after the Venisians'. His first choice Raimond Aurellex, who had married his youngest sister and whose brother Lohis had died leading the charge at the Battle of Satillew, died in a hunting accident in 1511 (and despite the popular understanding, this particular incident was likely not an assassination).

In the end, the Concert elected Menton's cousin Antoin Amigòt to lead the Concert under the close attention and martial guidance of daus Sanz, through whom Daniel Menton doubtless exercised his influence long after his nominal stepping down. But military advice would be of only limited use to Antoin, as in 1519 a new threat arrived in Europe not seen since the days of the German Secession. The Second Great Dying struck naval powers early and mercilessly, and Provence was to be no exception…

< attested in 11C in Old Boral istemne “tree trunk, stem”, from Old English stemn “stem, trunk, mast”. The metaphor of “ancestry is a tree” is pervasive in the language, and the literal meaning had been entirely displaced by native taisc/tronc (depending on dialect) by the fourteenth century. In modern times it is usually restricted to animal pedigree—using it of humans may be mocking or parodic.

This was Burnows' first foray into a more mature style, having previously written Back to Front, a beloved series of children's stories about a school class adventuring through time. Burnows is considered to have masterfully followed his readership as they grew up; this new series enjoyed great success among those who read Back to Front as children.

< attested from late 10C in Old Boral flanar “rush, act rashly”, probably getting to its modern sense via “stray, go off course” (see the parallel developments in Norman French flanner).

    in translation from L'Inclusion Deviante di Conti Polari (The Deviance Incorporation of Folk Tales), 1970 sociological work by Dr Tanasio Capretti, theologian and humanist at the University of Florence. It was published simultaneously with dozens of other related books from academies across the world, in order to coincide with the hundred and twentieth anniversary of the Laic Declarations and the concommittant realignment in the mid-nineteenth century that heralded the Good Game period.

Chapter 14: La Caccia Salvaggia (The Wild Hunt)

Just as the Danes attributed the thunder to the wrath of Thor, so too we can imagine whence came the tales of a great army of hunting party of ghosts, riding and shouting across the night sky. The howling winds, after all, sound not so differently from the howls of hunting dogs. From isolated hamlets north of the Humber to snow-blanketed Alpine villages, the motherly advice given to all children when they hear the Great Wild Hunt (or the Herlathing, or the Wütendes Heer) passing overheard is the same: stay inside, look away, do your best to pretend they aren't there.

Most scholars today accept that the various folk traditions of a ghostly hunt stem from a single ancient source, at least in Europe (the similar Lanhyatian stories are of course unrelated). Many of these tales come specifically from the Danes' Oskarrej via cultural transmission in the Viking Age—for example, in Borland the story of the cauç ragnt shows clear signs of Danish origin (not least that it is usually led by Balegr, a common kenning for Odin), but the tales often incorporate the graveyard fiddlers, who are idiosyncratic to the island.

Like so many of these tales, what had been amoral or even virtuous characters in the early mediæval period (see Chapter VI, and the works of Braun & Kindler) were transformed by Christianisation into devils and demonic figures. It should therefore be of no surprise that the early Deviance Movement seized the imagery of the Wild Hunt for themselves. Cráyenschot's celebrated Ad Pentaculum spends much of the runtime detailing Jochem's induction into the Yacht, including one…

vriðel /vriˈðɛl/ [vʀɪˈðɛw] curtains, drapes, blinds, (in figurative use) veil, barrier, concealment

< from 10C in Old Boral vriðel “curtains; bandages, wrapped cloth”, a nominal diminutive derivation from vriðar “to wrap, plait, bind (of cloth)”; the verb became obsolete by the Middle Boral period, displaced by fasçar (modern fassar). This verb came from Old English wrīþan “to twist, wrap, bind”, from Classical German wrīþan “to weave, twist”. This also gives French ridew “curtains”, probably via High German ridil “ribbon” (note that Norman French retains cortine, from Late Latin cōrtīna “curtain”).

< first attested 11C in various forms as Old Boral folcair, falcaȝr, felcair,… “fern, bracken”. This comes from a reconstructed Vulgar Latin *filicāria (“thicket of ferns”), although there were probably variants with inital vowel as <a> or <u>. This noun is a late-derivation collective of Latin filix “fern”, probably from Greek. Despite popular attempts to link the Borlish form to Old English folc “people, nation, crowd”, this is semantically untenable.

It further stated that each successive generation grew from miniature versions of themselves (which Dufresne called zoia, not to be confused with our modern use of the term for one-case life), themselves containing yet-smaller forms for the grandchild generation, and so on.

It is a deverbal noun from lougir “to gleam, glimmer”, which comes from earlier louger/fouger < Latin fulgeō “I flash, I lighten” (see also fourraç “lightning”, from the same source).

This verb is from Old Boral trascinar “to drag, pull, trail”, from Vulgar Latin traxinō, variant of traginō and originally from Latin trahō “I pull, drag”.

    taken from A Mapbook Compendium of Europe, from the Division of Rome until the German Secession (450–1250 N), published by the Tommarth Open School of History in 1997. It is used as part of the supplementary reference materials provided for students sitting history scitations in many Merch universities.

The Drengotian Empire, named for its ruling family the Drengot (formerly the ruling ducal family of Normandy) had by 1120 N maintained stable borders for several decades. The empire owes this impression of peace in part to the decentralised structure of the realm: Tolose even held a standing army for its perennial skirmishes with neighbouring Barcelon.

But of course none were more independent in the so-called Constant Empire (a name used only in retrospect in an attempt to lend the realm gravitas, referencing Rome's District of Constantius) than Kernow and Devon, who a century earlier had been vital to the Norman conquest of Kent. Indeed, in 1121 N King Vigo of Greater Devon would attack Wales without the support of Emperor Roger II.

Roger II spent most of his reign in Paris, with his younger brother Matthew ruling in his name in London. By 1120 N, much of the empire's treasury has been spent on defending the long eastern border with Willemy. In particular, the construction of a new Great Castle at Vésonçon had been completed the year before, the last point in a defensive line spanning from Flanders to the Alps.

Pejorative sense from the early 19C, developing in the Straightforward Fashion popular across northern Europe at that time.

NEWS AFIELD: SCANDAL! HASINICK [2] PRINCE ADMITS 30⅊ MILLION OF DEBT

Prince Pether Tamaha, lesser-known son of the illustrious Hasinick monarchy, has admitted to the press that he owes thirty million poise (over twenty million trone) in debt to speculation companies and to national banks across the continent from Mashick to Ambrosia [3]. Furthermore, his grandfather the King has declined to bail him out, in an unprecedented move.

Longtime speculation has held that the young prince (who hosted a lavish thirtieth birthday celebration in the Davarn Heul [4] this February, with over five thousand attendees) has been regularly running through his funds and relying on his family's coffers. "For King Maldwen to now stem the flow of gold to his grandchild indicates one of two things," writes Matties Gramunt, Provincial ambassador to Gulf Mendeva [5]. "Either personal relations between the prince and his family have deteriorated to a serious nazir, or else the Tamaha monarchy is itself in dire financial straits." The steward convoker to the family has so far refused to comment on the issue.

News of the joint Morrack and British voyages had inflamed all Europe with an irrepressible wanderlust, and while the Kazmid and Vascon enterprises had firmly established themselves as sole merchants in eastern Mendeva and Horizic Cappatia, few had yet mapped the Atlantic coastline of Cappatia. Thus there was an attainable goal for the Emperor to assign to the great fleet at his disposal: discover all that these lands had to offer, from Berpittang wood to crimson Mackow feathers.”

a) With reference to the Neuwillem Bróderratcronike (1561-97), evaluate Haddani's framing of the factors that led to the German exploration of Atlantic Cappatia in the latter half of the sixteenth century.

b) To what extent was Emperor Matthias II (1542-68) able to influence the mercantile decisions of the Stadbund at all? Compare the stance of the Drachman merchant dynasty towards the various monarchic European powers with which they dealt, and the underlying economic conditions leading to these dynamics.

c) How separately can we consider the activities of the Bróderrat in establishing Neuwillem, Parnow and other wayports from the similar activities of Morrack in Mashick and Tavancy; what collaboration and cross-pollination of methods and technologies, if any, occurred between the Vetomundine companies?

accapellar /aˌka.peˈlar/ [ɐ.ka.pɪˈlɑː] to don a hat, to put a hat on

< attested, at least in the past participial form accapellað “wearing a hat” (the only form in productive use, though the finite verb occurs sporadically), since the fourteenth century. It is modelled after other verbs in a-X-ar, such as arrimbandar “to beribbon”, abancar “to make landfall” and akirtar “to ignite”. Specifically, it is derived from capel “hat”, from Vulgar Latin cappellus with the same meaning, itself a diminutive from Latin cappa “cape, cloak”.

pareiveðr /ˌpa.riˈvɛ.ðr̩/ [ˌpa.ʀɪˈvɛ.ðɐ] windowsill, ledge, skirting

< attested since 18C as parey-veðr “windowsill”, modelled after French pareil-verre with the same meaning (Boral otherwise having very few such verb-noun compounds). Literally meaning “levels the glass”, the verb comes from parey “same, equal”, a dialect form from Vulgar Latin pariclus, from Latin pār “even, equal”. The noun veðr is directly from Latin vitrum “glass”. The hyphen was dropped in the 1870 reform a dreçment which standardised Boral spelling.

yenç /ˈjɛnts/ arrival, advent, appearance, approach

< attested since 10C in Old Boral iemnce “success, attainment, procurement”, from Latin ementia “purchase, procurement”, a nominal derivation from emō “I buy, acquire”. The meaning of the noun had shifted to “seizing, reaching” by 13C, and then to its modern sense two centuries later. The corresponding verb iemr “to manage, attain” (modern yembr “to obtain, reach, arrive”) appears to have followed the noun in its meaning.

laçploy /latsˈplɔj/ rain shelter, gazebo

< used from 1803 in Boral, originally hyphenated, meaning “catches rain”. It is a calque of French pare-pluye “keeps rain away”. The verb laçar “to catch, intercept, parry, deflect” comes from Old Boral latiar “to catch, snatch, grab” (probably with /tʃ/ although this is controversial; the phoneme if it existed appeared only in loans). This is a borrowing from Old English læċċan with the same sense. The noun ploy “rain” descends directly from Latin pluvia, meaning the same thing.

…now arrive on our own shores, for we cannot ignore Monçating any longer.

The sixth Baron Monçating was born to Lord Josua and Lady Evangelin in the winter of 1770 at their estate in Launembrig. Lord Josua, inevitably, was himself a controversial figure in Damvath society for several reasons: having been born in the Cappatian staddomain, having married a noblewoman of Warnine descent (far too recently for Vetomundine sensibilities), and finally having inherited the Barony of Haubrath from his second cousin following a decade-long legal battle (one of the longest legal disputes in Borland history). His decision thereupon to dissolve the senior title and retain only Monçating was the final nail in the coffin for any hope of respectability.

Nonetheless they remained in Borland (complaining endlessly about the climate, if accounts in their acquaintances' letters are to be believed!) and bore six children, of whom our hero Simon was the eldest. Raised in the shadow of scandal, of legal and political battles, Simon Monçating learnt early how thinly-justified the power structures of the world could be. The Launembrig estate hosted regular gatherings of theorists and philosophers; the earliest writings we have in Simon's hand are from a tutor's worksheet carried by accident to Denmark in the papers of Jan Prestr in 1779 (author of Discriptione Bestiarum Suboles Ferentis “On the Classification of the Child-Bearing Beasts”).

However interesting his childhood—by eighteen Simon could play the clavier and the torriot, and speak Latin, Dutch, and Vascon (and even Warnine, according to his defamers)—we remember the sixth Lord Monçating today for his later escapades…

stivað /stiˈvaθ/ [stɪˈvah] crowded, stuffed; fed up, frustrated

< attested almost continuously, at least in its literal sense of “stuffed, packed, crammed in”; see Old Boral istivaða in the eighth-century Halvuy chronicle, for example. The word is transparently the past participle of stivar “to stuff, pack, crowd”, from Latin stīpō “I compress, cram, surround”. Its metaphorical use for “frustrated, fed up, having had enough” is seen in writing only from 15C but is suspected to be an old usage.

There was possible influence from Old Norse hverf “turning, curve” (the cognate to hwearf), although this is contested. The semantics of quarf broadened to pile-supported structures like piers by the seventeenth century, displacing biðr “pier, jetty” (from Vulgar Latin petricus, related to petra “stone”).

aziar /aˈzjar/ [ɐˈzjɑː] to be standing (of people and of buildings), to be erect (both of construction and in vulgar use)

< from 12C in late Old Boral aziȝar “to be standing (of people)”, either borrowed with rebracketing alongside aziȝ “boot” from Andalus laziga “boot”, lazigar “to wear boots”, or else a verbal derivation from aziȝ within Boral. The Andalus noun is from Moorish Arabic أَحْذِيَة‎ • (ʾaḥḏiya) “leather boots”, plural of حِذَاء • (ḥiḏāʾ) “boot, shoe”. Extension of the verb to buildings and for arousal are both seen by the 15th century. The participle aziant “standing” strongly connotes verticality and a free-standing quality that the alternative pos “placed, put, stood” does not.

The noun would perhaps more regularly be concretion /ˌkɔn.kreˈtsjɔn/, but analogical pressure from words like parceuçon “perception” gives the modern form, attested since 17C.

…nevertheless already we see a stronger independent sense of Borlish identity alongside the universal Roman citizenship than almost anywhere else in the Empire.

Despite its political separation, the Latin of Borland follows the course of the Continental and British vernaculars. By the end of the third century Nascentiæ the distinct vocative forms survived only sporadically (for example, in fīlī! “son!”), and the genitive forms (especially the plural) were more and more replaced by the ablative. At this point it is accurate enough to describe the Vulgar Latin as having only four cases:
[image]

Observe that already the singular forms are converging; a similar process occurs in the other declensions. The next reduction saw the genitive and dative merging to a singular “oblique”, while the loss of nasalisation in the fifth century collapsed the singular forms entirely (Here the situation was different in the second declension: see the Appendices for details). Note also the prosthetic /i/, which was /e/ on the continent.
[image]

Here we truly depart from the Gallic development with the debuccalisation of final /s/, and the proceeding reduction of posttonic. The Oblique form is replaced entirely by the accusative with prepositions, and even the number distinction finds itself on shaky footing.

The noun ogl “eye” is directly from Latin oculus via Old Boral oȝl(e) [oɣlə ~ oʎːə], having the same sense.

It is theorised to be from a rider's command “Preuç!” to their horse to trot, although evidence of this use is scant. This adjective preuç “tame, mild, gentle, balmy” is a backformation from verb appreuçar “to tame, calm, corral, domesticate”, itself from Vulgar Latin apprīvātiō “I tame”.

    from A Baptism of Fire: Christianity and the Graven by Agata Naziunas, published 1988 by Leidéiai Givatés. The textbook chronicles the changing religious landscape of the Graven peoples, from the pre-Christian period through the twelfth-century Imperial Evangelism of the Far North, and the complex alliances that formed after the German Secession.

…and while the status quo of Imperial hegemony was already falling apart (with the dissolution of the First Drengotian Empire to the west, the Jeanish invasion of the Tyrrhene Isles in 1207 and the declaration of independent Maghreve and Libyan kingdoms in 1237/هـ634), its true death knell was the German Secession. Through the decades after the Pauline Denuncations each individual duchy (and in some cases each county!) declared either for Rome or for Augsburg, in a powderkeg patchwork of allegiances that, of course, led to the collapse of the German Empire in spectacular fashion.

Of particular interest is the duchy of Crain (ducātum Carniolæ), which importantly controlled the prosperous city of Trieste, as well as fertile lands further east. Their declaration in support of the Roman Papacy was likely more pragmatic than out of true religious fervour (bordering both Lombardy and Crovatia), but in any case they were perfectly positioned to contribute to the Baptism of the North.

Though the Order of Saint Hemma of Still Water (the Convoy Australier) had been leading the Baptism with monetary backing from Taxon of Hungary for several decades, it is in the context of the German Secession that the Baptism became an urgent project. Along with a new, more totalist Pope in Hermeneus II, it was feared that Augsburg might spread heresy faster than Rome could reach the North. To this end, forces from Rome-allied Crain and Borland converged on their first target: Lithow…

Extended to metaphorical use “to follow (someone's arguments), to keep up (with a lesson)” quickly, by 14C. More distant senses are seen only in the last two centuries. The noun hast “speed” is a borrowing from Old English hǣst “violence, strife”, with semantic influence from Old Dutch hást “haste, hurry”.

    short excerpt from Milda'h Ragner's 1954 popular history Grex Byd: Covarrod y Vaur Morwn (A Girdled World: The Great Borunesk Meeting), a popular account of the 1517 coming together of people from around the world on the island of Borune [Borneo], and the sequence of events that led up to it.

…this commonly-held misconception. In fact, more than a dozen crewmembers of mac Kellot's Phœbos had at least some Arabic; the British and Morrack mercantile domains had overlapped in Gaul and Spain for nearly two centuries at this point. At least two were entirely fluent writers, if not speakers—al-Hamid's book of circular functions was as yet untranslated in Latin and was an invaluable navigational aid.

So it is almost impossible to imagine the height of emotion on al-Casmi's Cynthia as, having travelled further west than anyone in quite possibly the history of humanity, arrived at last in Muharram 924 somewhere almost familiar. Following the stories they heard (in Arabic: much of the island had converted to Islam over the previous few decades, with continual trade from Muslim India) of the map-makers from the Far West, they travelled along the coast to the port city of Sinquan.

There at last they united with the Welsh explorers, shouting the immortal line across the bay; O Gastor ‘ila Bolux! “From Castor to Pollux!”, in a reference to the celestial twins of Greek myth. Or at least, mac Kellot's first mate calls out this line in the 1927 film adaptation One Day in Borune—the thought is pleasing enough that it does no harm to assume the meeting really did start so poetically. Awkwardly, al-Casmi's otherwise-impeccable logbook is missing the vital few pages surrounding this date…

trasir /traˈzir/ [tʀɐˈzɪː] (transitive) to cross, traverse, go through; to penetrate, saturate, permeate; (intransitive) to be understood, come across; to die, pass away

< attested in Old Boral as tras(e)ir “to go across, through”; in earlier texts it is still treated as a compound of tras- “across” Latin trāns- “through, across, beyond” and (e)ir “to go” < Latin eō, īre “I go”. As eir acquires suppletive forms from vādō “I go, walk”, trasir is reanalysed as a regular -ir¹ verb; this process is complete by the Middle Boral period. The intransitive usage is original, though with the transitive senses (it was used with the preposition par “by, through”). We see the newer senses of “permeate” and of “be understood” used from the fourteenth century. In the sense “pass on, die” its use is cyclical; it last returned to common use in the 1920s.

in translation from the 1981 scitation paper for the Dijon New School's Domain History [1] course L'Art Militaire ès Guerres Romantiques (Strategy in the Romantic Wars). The course covers the 1640s to ‘60s, the most active portion of the various conflicts all grouped together under the label “Romantic Wars”.
Part II: Near Asia and the Novamund [The New World]

Question 13 (40 minutes)
Answer any two of the following three questions.

i) Should the Hellenic Conflict in Armenia [2] of the 1640s be classified as a Romantic War? Give arguments for and against its inclusion, with particular attention to the religious strife concomitant with the Riyalid Revenge [3].

ii) With reference to Vijarrania's War without Walls, discuss the most popular theories attempting to explain the expulsion of all Gurjat and Seldivan [4] traders from Moscat in 1652 (1062), several months before the fall of the Ibadine Imamate [5] to Hadramot [6] forces.

iii) To what extent was Morrack [Morocco] able to exploit the death of Emperor Carivasary [7] to increase silver exports to the Vetomund [Eurasia] and finance their ongoing wars with Vascony and Libya?

Question 14 (50 minutes)
“The Mastoiset [Massachusett people] were bought with promises of horses and other protection from their expansionist neighbours west of the Sturgovan Mountains [the Appalachians], and without their aid the British Sack of Santrafew [8] could never have succeeded. Mayor Alexandre fi Marco's subsequent ban on trade with (and the twenty-mile exile of) all Mendevan peoples was thus justified, despite the 1621 Becouin Treaty.” — mac Harlach, The Making of Mendeva, 1888 N

What does mac Harlach's point of view regarding the Sack of Santrafew reveal about the political climate of Britain during the Good Game [9] decades?

-

[1] An academic tradition of historiography focusing on the development of a single “domain”—for example medicine, warcraft, government or agriculture—through the centuries. It is defined principally in opposition to Concurrence History, which instead studies a period of time across all different domains.

[2] The latest of a series of conflicts fought by the Empire of the Hellenes [roughly, the Byzantines] in the East with Arab and later Turkish people for access to the Caspian Sea.

[3] The Riyalid Sultanate was at this time the largest Muslim state in the world, stretching from Iscandar [Alexandria, Egypt] to Medina, east to the Baghdad Exclave and bordering the Hadramot [6] to the south.

[4] An Indian state on the west coast of mixed Muslim and Hindu population under the originally-Turkic Jamishid Empire ruling from Tammombay [Mumbai], and Sri Lanka, respectively.

[5] Ibadine Islam being a form of Islam named for Abdullah ibn Ibad, with Oman (and specifically the city of Moscat) as a heartland but with smaller groups of adherents as far afield as Andalus.

[6] The Hadramot were a loose collection of wealthy city states and admiraltys in Yemen and Ethiopia, controlling trade through the Gulf of Aden.

[7] Ruler of the Inca and vassal peoples from 1599 until his (suspected) assassination in 1660, the longest-reigning monarch in Cappatian [South American] history.

[8] Santrafew is one of the earliest and most northerly trade settlements in New Provence, founded in 1564. It is located approximately on the site of Boston, Massachusetts.

[9] The “Good Game” or “Grand-Jeu” period refers to the years in the late nineteenth century between the rapid innovation of the Global Workshop and the devastation of the Millstone War.

The noun gyr “orbit, cycle” is borrowed from Latin gȳrus “circle, cycle, orbit, ring”, from Greek γῦρος (gûros) “ring”.

spornar /spɔrˈnar/ [spʊːˈnɑː] to reject, avoid, spurn, abhor; (slang) to outclass, be out of the league of

For comparison, see modern Wessern spurren “to misstep, trip, make a mistake” and Kentish sporn “to trample, force to the ground, crush, decisively beat”, whence Norman esporner “to vanquish, annihilate, utterly destroy”. It is possibly these Norman senses which influence the modern slang use of the verb, attested from the 1950s (and which despite the popular imagination does not originate in the Furore and Drengot Collapse).

The verb dar is directly from Latin dō “I give, offer”, while apar is an adverbial derivation from the preposition par < Latin per “through, by, during”. The verb had become obsolote outside this expression by the early nineteenth century, supplanted by expanded use of verbs like laiscar “to let go, drop, loosen”.

…during James V of Barcelon's Cordin wardship in the late 1660s.

An account of the traditions of Borland cannot be complete without extensive discussion of the Winter Feast, or the Revillon (in Borlish, Reveglon means “vigil”). Practised in Borland by even the pre-Roman Insular Kelts, it is one of the oldest continuously-practised folk traditions in Europe.

Early evidence of the Winter Feast is given in the writings of the third-century Roman historian Ammian Marcellinus in his brief asides on the island territories. Notably his is almost the only source on the custom from the first millenium that isn't moralising against the practice as unholy and pagan—when the Feast in mentioned in post-Classical monastic sources it is exclusively to disapprove.

Indeed, far cry from the Nativity Fast common across Christendom at the time from Aghkill [near Ballymena, NI] to Yerevan, the Revillon (at this time still held on the winter solstice itself and called the <Flidōlus>, a name of uncertain origin) comprised bustling public meals held in great halls or around bonfires to which all brought food and from which all ate well.

The appropriation of the tradition by the church was as gradual as it was inevitable. To some extent, the pre-Christian origin of the feast was simply forgotten over the centuries. As the monks of Borland began increasingly to resemble the lay population (in the early centuries much of Borland's clergy were imported or exiled from further south), so too did the pagan and Christian traditions.

We do not need to suppose an intentional subversion of the Revillon by the Church, but in any case the link between the Winter Feast and Christide had been firmly established by 1100, during the reign of…

amigtað colleger /ˌa.majˈtað ˌko.leˈgɛr/ [ˌa.mɐjˈtah ˌko.lɪˈgɛː] workplace banter, camaraderie; often used somewhat derisively to refer metonymically to externally-imposed socialisation in the workplace

< phrase coined in 1859 as amité collégiale by the Dijon Ministry for Work as the Global Workshop period took over the French polities and the nascent Drengot Collusion. The phrase appears in Boral shortly after Borland's entry into the Collusion and the abdication of Natalia II on Revillon [Christmas Eve] 1894. It was likely used ironically in speech almost as soon as it appeared in official memoranda; the earliest attestation in writing is from one of Bellamy's romances.

The word amigtað “friendship” is synchronically analysable as amig “friend” < Latin amīcus/a “friend” with the nominaliser -tað, but in fact likely derives directly from the Late Insular Latin *amictate, from Vulgar Latin amīcitās “friendship”. The adjective colleger “of the workplace, in the office” is an adjectival derivation via -er < Latin -ārius of the noun colleg “colleague, coworker”. This in turn is a Middle Boral borrowing from Latin collega “a partner in office”.

    D'alcun sunt a amigtað colleger vil jo Marc supportar.

< attested since the thirteenth century in early Middle Boral scaumel /ʃauˈmɛl/ “reed pen, quill pen”. This comes from late Old Norman chaumel “reed, rush; reed pen” (modern chalmew “clarinet, pipe” with influence from more southerly forms), which reflects Late Latin calamellus “reed (pen)”, a diminutive of calamus “reed, cane, stalk, straw”. This in turn is a borrowing from Greek κᾰ́λᾰμος (kálamos) with the same sense, and so the Boral is cognate with calamon “aerial, antenna”, which is taken directly from the Greek. The non-writing senses date from the 17C and were probably absorbed from the French cognates on the continent.

Question 1: How did Britain [a polity comprising most of the British Isles bar IRL England] retain its position of cultural prestige over British Mendeva during the final years of the nineteenth century even as the latter overtook Britain in population and industry, and to what extent were the ethics of the Household Renovation exported to the Novomund via this cachet?

- for the first, look for talk of increased transmigration of the new rich across the Atlantic and rates of intermarriage thereamongst.
- further, reward mention of the boom of the Vetomundine masquira genre and how it displaced the autochthonous herdtale tradition (specifically look for reference to Cosωteg's Hasiny diaries).
- for the second, only give credit to responses highlighting the ongoing debate as to the timeline of Laic adoption in Gulf Mendeva; at least two disagreeing authors must be mentioned.

Question 2: Discuss the rise of the New Urban Mesh and their subsumption into the Collusion, with emphasis on the growth of London following the Global Workshop period. In particular, compare the popular account of their use of espionage in the East to steer politics in tradewise-beneficial directions with the likely reality.

- give credit for emphasising the role of maritime technology and especially access to coal in supporting the Urban trade.
- look for responses which prove that the student has done more than watch 1968 film “Mr Desarden, Prince Consort”; that they are actually familiar with James Desarden's career in the City Administration both before his assignment to Nackon Day and after the scandal of 1887.

vatr /ˈva.tr̩/ [ˈva.tɐ] (in geometry) sine, the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle; (by extension, in architecture) diagonally-placed support beam

Etymology: adapted from Medieval/early Scholastic Latin vatrus “sine” (also attested are alvatrō, vater, etc.), itself loaned via Cordovan mathematical texts from Arabic وَتَر <watar> “(bow)string, sinew; chord of a circle, sine of an angle”. This is ultimately a calque of Sanscrit ज्या <jiā> “bowstring, sine”; the polysemy arises by picturing an arc of a circle with the chord drawn as a bow with bowstring.

It follows the development of numerical methods from prehistory and antiquity, up to the paradigm shift of the past few decades.

…the lengthy process of multiplication in tesquo to the much-easier addition and subtraction. For several centuries, the method of choice required two-way circular function enumerations—specifically, Nadim of Trapoles's identity:

Notice that the only required calculations are addition, subtraction, and applying/removing arrhumb. Although Nadim's own enumeration of arrhumb is lost to time, we retain similiar and almost-contemporaneous documents. Most famously, Jambor of Hungary's great Library of Sobjan received a transcription of the 1261 N liber numerorum compiled by the Saint Marinus scholars.

You may have noticed a restriction on what this method allows us to multiply; indeed, we can only remove arrhumb from a and b if they are sized less than 1. However, this is not real roadblock, as we can simply scale our two multiplicands as necessary. For example, to multiply 2567 and 9081, we instead find the product of 0.2567 and 0.9081, and in the end rescale to the correct magnitude.

The Trapolitan identity is a straightforward consequence of the more-familiar angle addition identities first recorded by the Gurjat mathematicians at Ujén in the tenth century. The timeline by which knowledge regarding circular function diffused to the west is uncertain and contested. Ambiguous references in pre-establishment Portingale writing are held up by some as…

aðendr /aˈðɛn.dr̩/ [ɐˈðɛn.dɐ] schedule, timetable, itinerary, list of stopping places or events in time order; also deadline, point of no return

Etymology: first seen in the sixteenth century as the deverbal derivation of verb aðendrar “to travel, journey, tour”; the noun originally seems to mean “path, route (of a journey)”.

The verb is older, a variant (presumably by analogy with other verbs in að- like aðoir, aðombrar, etc.) of earlier eðenrar “to be under way, be on a journey; especially, to travel by boat”, attested from the ninth century in the Hadambour chronicle.

This Old Boral verb is a clear descendant of Insular Latin verb itinerō “I travel, voyage”, non-deponent version of better-attested Classical verb itineror, of the same meaning. This is a derivation from iter “journey, trip”, other descendants of which include Norman eithre /æjðə/ “course, route, progress along a path, inertia” and possibly Vascon gider /ˈʃi.ðɛɹ/ “travelling fair, circus, carnival”, though this is contested (see Taric 1979).

Question 2 (fifty minutes)

To what extent did Mendevan powers embrace baric [electric] steeplepost over the earlier mechanical systems more enthusiastically than their similarly-situated Vetomundine counterparts? You may wish to consider:

(i) the relative paucity of existing steeplepost infrastructure in Mendeva as compared with Europe, Asia (and even Cappatia) upon the development of the baric post,
(i) issues of geography south of the Sturgovan Mountains [Appalachians] disincentivising a method of communication reliant on sight at long range, and
(iii) technological innovations unique to the Novomund, including staddenzen [2] Cavang Menkhorst's improved coshow [rubber] separation for wires.

Question 7 (twenty minutes)

Answer the following twenty excourse questions in brief.
(i) In what year were the two coasts of Mendeva first connected by rail, and in what town was the final station ceremonially established?
…
(ix) The Lies of 1824 were transmitted by steeplepost to be displayed on the Tapestry of Aiga d'Angoixa [3]; who conspired to initiate the hoax?

tramou /traˈmu/ [tʀɐ.mu] line, line segment (considered with a specified direction), vector; displacement, difference between two positions; shortfall, insufficiency, extent to which a quota is not met

Etymology: Middle Boral, a jargon borrowing from Middle Cambrick [Welsh] tramωi "movement, transit, course", used (in the form of a Latinised <trāmovis>, as though related to a verb *trāmoveō "I move across") in the fifteenth-century mathematical text Algorisma Geometrica, a treatise on how to perform numerical operations such as addition on geometric objects. The word tramωi itself must derive from Classical British elements trās- "across, completely" and mei- "to go" (see also Kernish tarvoi "carriage").

…the touching places of a given ray and our reference sphere.

The question of precisely who introduced the sun-centred model of the local cosmos to Rome has been long debated; almost all that can be said for certain is that by summer 1552 it was a conversation topic in fora across the city. We can perhaps assume that the sculptor Lorenzo dell'Acchedia was inspired to make his Macchine di Helio via his close friend Martèl fi Bacchero, mathematician at the library of Saint Jerome, who was known to frequent the public debates.

One theory traces the arrival of these ideas from the east to a congeries of Morrack scholars returning from a stint in the third Hicma Academy, and in particular a printing found in Tarragon archives—a copy of an addendum to ibn Halwa's 1472 work On the Extent of the Seas (itself notable for being one of the last detailed descriptions of the world's geography before knowledge of the Novomund became widespread).

coroncr /koˈrɔnk/ [kʊˈʀɔŋk] pretender, claimant to a throne; impostor, fraud, person under a false identity or profession false qualifications; hypocrite, person whose words and deeds diverge

Etymology: uncertain, but old—the first meaning of "claimant" is attested from the ninth century during the ascendancy of Dane Borland. One theory proposes a connection with coroun "crown, kingship" < Latin corōna "garland, wreath, crown", perhaps via a diminutive *corōnucula, although the accent being on the second syllable is hard to explain (we would expect coronoil). Another links it to the Dane rule and suggests dissimilation from earlier *conong < Norse konungr "king".

What, for example, can we make of the influx of Norse vocabulary in the field of archery from the early ninth century? We see <bers> "target, quarry" in a 834 N parabolic addendum from the Marvil chronicle; soon after are <boger> "archer", <arn> "fletch" and <scutar> "shoot" attested also. What is clear is that the bow and arrow were commonplace weapons available to any freeman in the Dane lands; consider the legend of Fithrischelve, who was said to have to outwitted the far-seer Quasir by striking him with an arrow fired from four thousand paces, beyond even his sight.

Techniques in bowmaking must also have spread rapidly throughout the Dane territories, or at least bows obtained in raids east of Idel made their way expediently westward.

Etymology:
Originally from Andalus; the glassware sense is the first. From an Arabic phrase like زجاج أخضر <zujáj 'ahdar> meaning "green glass", although there is considerable dialect variation in this term. Its route from there to Borland is unclear, though it was likely borrowed during the Second Tetrarchy, given the early twelfth-century attestation of <vitrum zoiactalis> in the alchemical writings of Jan Curçon. Techniques in glassmaking accelerated rapidly in ninth century Andalus, likely due to a cut-off of supply from the east; see the recent archaeological findings of the Stelazgo Edifice.

sar marcer /ˈsar marˈtsɛr/ [ˈsɑː mɐːˈtsɛː] trade network, means of transporting goods for sale around a region

Etymology: The noun sar "(fish)net, mesh, network" arrives in Boral from Vascon fishermen in the thirteenth century, one of the many naval words taken therefrom: see hagr “mast” and bakilau “cod”, also from Vask. Its metaphorical extension to general networks is presumably calqued from the similar metaphors in use in neighbouring languages, though in Boral itself this is not attested until 1836. The adjective marcer "commercial, relating to trade goods" is a transparent adjectival derivation of març "trade good", a descendant of Latin merx, with the same meaning.

Ða gent oc saun, y sar marcer dourra mal.

section taken from Agricultural Innovations of the Lombard and Napolitan Heredical Theorists in the Utter Alpine, an 1865 reference book detailing various advances in farming and husbandry during the Long Peace of the late eighteenth century. It was written (originally in Borlish as Tarrouçon Saðer dy Theorist Heredical Lombardesc e Napollesc ny Doutr-Alp) by farm alchemist Thaubrett of Crowmarsh, affiliated with the Institute for Supply in Axbane. It is notable for interspersing various recipes between the technical discussions, to illuminate the scientific principles at work (and for said recipes, on the whole, not being very good).

…with limmon sliced beneath. Serve hot lest the confection be permitted to gel.

But the majority (four parts in five, in accordance with the latest annual reports from the Institute itself) of sugar consumed on Borland is produced in the vicinity. The first attestations of betraver [beet sugar] syrup being produced are all in the sixteenth century; see for example the in experientia writings of Willem theorist Tewis Camigner, wherein the sweetness and 'billrod hue' of beet syrup are noted.

There is little evidence of commercial production of what we might call 'natural betraver' in Willem during the Romantic Wars and the concomitant disruption to the trade mesh. Its inferiority as compared to cane hindered the growth of any real demand for the substance. Moreover, usual varieties of beet before the Pentrose survey of the 1730s would contain perhaps one part in eighty sugar, far lower than cane.

The importance of the Pentrose survey cannot be overstated. Its crowning glory—the braxoch, a hybrid of Silesian and Cassuvian beets with a characteristic gold colour that Bitom would later incorporate into its standard—is the ancestor to all modern…

manneç mauser /maˈnɛts moˈzɛr/ [mɐˈnɛts mʊˈzɛː] a region in which bananas are grown, a locale known for banana export; sun belt, any region known for particularly balmy, warm or sunny weather

Etymology: literally "banana-ish lands". The noun manneç "realm, lands, domain" is somewhat archaic in general use but can be employed humorously (here it was chosen presumably for the alliteration); it descends from an Old Boral manɛzȝ or similar, meaning "land holding, domain of a lord". It is a nominalisation of verb maner "to stay, remain" (cf. modern remanir), from Latin maneō in the same sense.

The word mauser is a productive adjectival extension of maus "banana, plantain", which is first attested in Boral in 1397 N (though there is no consistent usage until at least a century later). It is borrowed somehow through the European trade mesh (some suggest a British intermediary but it is impossible to be certain) from Arabic مَوْز (mawz) "bananas"; confusion as to the word's gender in Boral's neighbouring languages suggests it came north along various routes.

Meanwhile, the Borlish city of Axbane (or Ausbagn in the Boral, which descends from a Latin Aquīs Balneī "at the bathing waters"), which had been connected across the Rustigh [2] to the mainland since the establishment there of the originally-Flemish Order of Saint James in the eleventh century, flourished as the meeting grounds for both the trade meshes of the stadbund as well as the Borlish fleet. Exports of Jaibos breweries' renowned beers and ciders aside, the throughput of the Axbane port is thought to account for over a third of European trade outside the Middlesea by 1400 N (after which point it loses some ground to cities in the outer tallaths of Wales and to the incipient Vascon ascendancy).

The late fourteenth century also sees this Borlish city develop a particularly close relationship with Bremen, whose mayor…

disceir /diˈxir/ [dɪˈçɪː] to not appear, be missing, to not show up at the right time or place; to depart, abandon, leave, especially unexpectedly or ahead of time; to fail, not make it, to miss a target or standard with ill effect; in linguistics, to lenite, to undergo lenition and soften, or else to undergo syncope (disappear from the interior of a word or phrase)

A verb of the -r conjugation, patterning after leir "to read" (past participle disceut /diˈxawt/).

Etymology: a thirteenth-century borrowing into Middle Boral of Latin discēdō "I leave, retire, not fulfill, deviate, vanish, die", adapted to the model of native words like acceir < accēdō "I approach" and occeir < occidō "I die". Originally referring only to people, its usage broadened over time; the sense in linguistics is in the Norman French cognate discire, from the seventeenth century in Jan Tacqueray's Divergence of the Roman Tongues.

…a borrowing from Norse or English by considering which softenings have occured within the word—but be careful! If you don't know the source of the loanword precisely you can fail to take into account its original pronunciation. For example, one might suppose Boral <fruyar> "to dance" must be a very early borrowing from Old English frician, to have done away with the /k/ completely. But in fact evidence of Sothbar dialect particularities suggests that in the proximate source the verb was already pronounced /ˈfriːjːan/, from which we can only conclude that the word enters Boral at some point after the evolution of /dʒ/ (textual evidence dates it to at least the ninth century).

Later on (see chapter 6) we will also see how sound changes have no memory—later sound changes can reverse the effects of earlier ones, even centuries later. The most impressive example of this process in Boral must be the early deletion of Latin <v> between vowels (hypothesised to have been underway even in the late Classical period), together with the circa seventeenth-century insertion of <v> to break up hiatus between /o/ and another vowel. For example, the Latin novellus "young, newly made" yields Old Boral noel "fresh, newborn", and Modern Boral novel "new". Often, however, such reversals affect only a portion…

Etymology: borrowed into Boral in the late sixteenth century from Scholastic Latin dētaxiō "chemical reaction", popular variant of dētactiō by analogy with nouns such as connexiō "junction".

In light of Monçating's facility with the instrument, let us begin in the pipe family with the torriot. Before the nineteenth century, the (precursors to the) torriot and similar low-pitched pipe instruments generally had a range of less than two doublings and the lack of modern reedmaking techniques severely limited their volume. It was only with the advent of pedal holes—adapted from mechanisms pioneered with the Madray peria nadaswarm some decades earlier—that torriot players could reach both its famed low notes (and finally be worthy of the name "little thunder" [1]) and the startingly clear alto range.

No composer delighted more in the torriot than Mollam Bushta, ally of the early Deviance movement and brother of the famed lady explorer Poshack Nerwaman (the tales of whose travels…

kevlar /keˈvlar/ [kɪˈvlɑː] robbery, burglary, theft, the act of acquiring property illegally; heist, an instance of robbery, especially from an institution such as a bank, museum or other secure stronghold; (by extension) scheme, plot, a complex plan to conduct a likely-illegal activity; (archaic cant or modern humorous, non-finite forms only) to rob, burgle, thieve, to undertake a heist

Also romanç kevlar | heist story, tale in which a heist is central to the plot, especially considered as a subgenre of masquira novels and films

Etymology: disputed. The noun first definite attestation in writing is in the 1793 work An Enumeration of Thieves' Cant (originally in Boral as Enombr a Vanagl Saccacer), describing the slang of the Damvath underworld. Originally referring to any robbery, the narrower sense has been strengthened by its association to fiction; the twentieth century saw kevlar borrowed into many languages to refer to the genre of stories—see English kevler romance, for example.

Possible antedatings to Pentrose/Axbane slang have led some to conjecture a connection to a Welsh *cafelat "act of obtaining", although the phonetic implausibility (the Welsh would have penultimate stress) and the utter lack of outside evidence for this derivative of verb cafel "to get, be given" tally against it. Furthermore, if the intriguing reference to vol quȝralle "quiral (?) theft" in a fourteenth-century record of Jeluðrou court proceedings is an ancestor, the period (before substantial Welsh immigration to the cities of southern Borland) and the location (a minor northern town) rule this theory out definitively.

Unfortunately, the other options are just as easily discarded. Backslang—the practice of generating slang by saying words backwards—from a Germanic cognate of "robbing" (most often suggested is Frisian raovig, but even this is tenuous) is a popular but ultimately unworkable theory. Saxon cüble "luggage, baggage" or the derivation cübler "footman, male servant, especially one tasked with carrying possessions around" also do not quite harmonise with the timeline and the semantics.

…familiar with the quintessentially Albic folk tales of the farmer duke and his masked band. 

Although these earlier examples illustrate the timelessness of some of masquira's central tropes (most vitally the eponyous masks!), we do not see the emergence of a distinct genre until the nineteenth century, with the publication in 1860 Portingale of Ezio Carvallo's trevold Tejan de Masquira ou Jalico (released in Boral as Cuscon Reðr Cognit [2], translated by Anscon Polgat). It was Carvallo's works—this first book being only the first in a dozen-strong series—which introduced many of the essential properties of a masquira tale, and first presented them together as a coherent whole.

For example, Jalico almost singlehandedly creates the conceit of the kevler [heist] in which our protagonist must obtain a valuable item by means of a complicated scheme involving trickery and deception; note that the word itself would not be applied to the trope for some time, as it is of Borlish origin. Often an item of jewellery, masquira is often said to run parallel to the older Cathayan tradition of tapsue (magpie) tales. We can also connect the two traditions by their adoption by tovarick…

The Latinised form suggests an adjectival derivation from a word *muzus, but in fact the resemblance is coincidental; Andalus mozada is loaned from Arabic مُسَطَّح • (musaṭṭaḥ) "flat, even, level".

Though the geometrical meaning is oldest, the extension to perspective is early, and not limited to Boral. It is in the Italian revitalist painting of the sixteenth century that we first see this usage, to refer to the plane parallel to the viewer cutting through the scene. The "fragmentary" and anatomical senses are more recent, first attested only in the nineteenth century; the former was in most popular colloquial use in the Good Game period (and has seen a resurgence in recent decades), while the latter is restricted to medical jargon.

This missive was sent in 1491 N along the Scholar's Chain—a branching route across western Europe in the late medieval period connecting many of the great centres of learning and theology—to an acquaintance at the Sovereign Library in Saint Marinus.

To the inestimable Lluprando da Treviso,

May the guidance of Saint David steer you well. Allow me to extend the warmest congratulations on the occasion of your son's birth; God willing all involved parties are in full health.

On the matter of the algorism, I must applaud your suggestions with regard to mozate [1] forms. It is good to remark that in the context of Euclid's plane, all mozate forms are parallel, which is to say that they are coplanar (there being only one plane!). This observation has led our Jarleth to conjecture that mozate forms might possess themselves a sort of direction, in the same way that a line segment may be endowed with one of two directions.

The most natural sense of direction a form like a circle or square might possess is undoubtedly the sense of a sundial. Whatever precisely it should mean for a circle to be sunward or awkward, in diagram it is not difficult to depict, the usual expedient of arrowheads sufficing as well here as it does for linear forms.

There is a strange consequence of this assignment of direction, however, as was revealed to me by the Lord in a dream. Consider a square as the…

kiglar /kajˈlar/ [kɐjˈlɑː] to miss, to not make it or an event or place on time or at all; to miss, not hit, to fail to reach a target; (reflexive) to screw up, go wrong, misfire, fall flat, to occur in a bad or incorrect way or to malfunction; (in mathematics) to exclude, not contain, as an element of a set or the target of a function

Etymology: from the seventeenth century in Boral as keilar, cuilar etc "to misfire, jam, fail to shoot", originally intransitive. It is a loan from Saxon kilen "to jam, clog up, get stuck or blocked", a verbal derivative of kil "wedge, blockage, jam". The reflexive use is somewhat later, after the semantic shift to a transitive "fail to hit"; the use in mathematics dates from the mid-nineteenth century to translate weglazen "omit" in Dümmeyer's foundational work in mathematical notation.

Any scheme which is as convoluted as the ones we have seen so far in this chapter is almost certainly doomed, if only because—as they say in Leon—one cannot knit a veskit [a sweater] on a dozen needles.

nau /no/ (obsolete or poetic) ship, boat, sea-faring vessel powered by oar or perhaps sail; (obsolete) nave, the middle or body of a church building usually containing the pews; (archaic or dialect) navel, bellybutton, indentation remaining in the abdomen of mammals from where the umbilicus was attached before birth; (dialect, by extension) indentation, hole, result of drilling with an auger; (archaic or historical) bowl, dish, boat, utensil with a handle and spout used for serving and pouring sauces such as gravy; (with bel in the phrase bel nau) saying, affirmation, profession, creed, words and promises as opposed to material acts

particularly bel nau /bɛl no/ [ˌbɛwˈno] fine words, promises or flattery usually viewed as empty, insincere or hypocritical; literally "beautiful creed".

Etymology: in most senses originally from Latin nāvis "ship; nave of a church", both senses of which survive unmolested into various Old Boral forms nau, naf, nof etc (though some of these are likely imported from Old French). The form naf for "nave" wins out by the end of fifteenth century, while the form nau is retained primarily for the innovative use "dish with handle for sauce"; this presumably is motivated by the similar shape.

Meanwhile, in the western dialects of Sothbar et al, the Old English nafola "navel" enters Boral as nau(l) in the same sense. The meaning of "navel, indentation" is occasionally seen in other dialects (perhaps motivated by the hollow shape of a bowl) but never catches on completely.

The jump to "aphorism, short witticism (usually in bel nau)" is less clear. There are extant 1760s ceramics with sayings written around the rim, but the causality here could flow in either direction: it is either that sayings were first likened to a pouring sauce dish and the ceramics are a reference thereto, or else some enterprising potter decided to decorate their wares in this way and the semantic shift of nau comes afterwards.

cair bel /ker bɛl/ [keː bɛw] (of weather) to be fine out, for the conditions outside to be pleasant, warm and sunny; (by extension, of a scene or scenario) to be going well, to turn out well, for people to be getting along or plans to be proceeding apace; (of people) to be content, satisfied or unconcerned, to take no issue; (by extension, pejoratively) to content oneself, to be oblivious to problems and think incorrectly that nothing is lacking or wrong

(An impersonal construction, only taking an optional dative experiencer.)

Etymology: literally "to happen beautiful", formed by analogy to many other uses of impersonal cair: for weather, as in cay ploy/sol "it's raining/sunny"; for events, as in cay je Lun "it's Monday"; and for periods, as in cay set hour "it's been seven hours".

The adjective bel "beautiful" descends uncomplicatedly from Latin bellus "pleasant, charming". The verb cair "to fall, to happen" is a somewhat hybridised descendant from Latin cadĕre "to fall, die, suit, happen" with a Vulgar form cadēre which exhibits a shift in conjugation.

jout /ʒut/ mould, cast, die, a hollow form or frame for shaping a melted substance; pattern, template, stencil, an object whose shape is used as a guide; motif, figure, repeated element of a design in art, texiles or music

Etymology: an early Middle Boral deverbal of joutar "to cast (metal), to use a mould" first attested in the early thirteenth century. The verb is older, a tenth-century borrowing from Old Norse gjóta "to pour, cast, mould". Extension of the noun to contexts other than metallurgy is seen from the late fifteenth century in textiles, and slightly later in more metaphorical use.

brogmoð /brɔjˈmɔθ/ [bʀʊjˈmɔh] mead, alcoholic beverage made from fermented honey and spices

Etymology: attested from the late ninth century in northern Old Boral bromiod et al. "bragget, mixture of mead and malt ale". The second half of the name is clearly a borrowing from Old Norse mjóðr "mead", while the first suggests a Latin *brocis (malt?). This could come from Gaulish bracis "malt" or perhaps a Borland Celtic *brax (?); either way it is almost cerainly of Celtic origin. The semantic shift to meaning just "mead" is hard to date, but is complete no later than the fifteenth century.

…renewed influx into the petty kingdoms of Angland and Southbar, the migrants bringing with them new technologies and new vocabulary alongside. It might be these people in particular who give us our modern words for "happiness", "saw" and even "butterfly".

The mixing of the Germanic peoples of the south and west with the Romans of the east and north would proceed only slowly, however, for the next couple of centuries. The question of fealty (that is, whether any kingdom of the island would receive official recognition and deference from the others) vexed the land, with conflicts leading to temporary alliances between Boral and Southbar or Boral and Angland depending on the political climate. Finally, in the early ninth century Roman king Stiglan married his son Marc to the only daughter of Alfegh of Angland, unifying their kingdoms and forcing Southbar to pledge fealty after the circa 810 N Battle of Fendal.

But at the same time as the tripartite situation of Borland was finally showing signs of stabilisation, Danish raids of the island's coast towns were increasing in frequency and strength. What incited the beginning of the Dane Supremacy in northern Europe in the ninth century has been much debated; it may have been advances in sail-making, or perhaps a series of bad harvests inspiring men to leave in search of wealth elsewhere.

Etymology: attested in Old Boral as havcetre "hawk", apparently a blend of Latin accipiter "hawk, merlin", Late Latin aucellus "small bird" (the Norman austour "goshawk" suggests a Latin ancestor of *auceptor which clearly results from a similar process), and Borland English hauc "hawk".

translation into Borlish and English of an excerpt from Estevan Mazon's 1893 work The Man from Everywhere (originally published in Leonese as El Hombre de Jallondes), released near the end of the Good Game period. The book's subject matter was subject to significant public scandal, and only the outbreak of the Millstone War could overshadow the senatorial debates over governmental funding of bookstores. Despite the scandal, the public's less-univerally negative reaction is a testament to the shifts since even the 1840s (see the flight of Antòin Herrel).

PAX, CHANDLER SOAPS RECALLED

Seven soap and washing-oil products have been removed from shop shelves after customers have reported severe rashes after use. The products (for a full list see insert) include bars from the well-known cleaningware companies Pax and Chandler. 

Early reports suggest that the culprit may be an impure batch of natre's laurick cuprose [sodium lauryl sulphate], a foaming substance widely added to soap gels and bars. Efforts to trace the source of the contamination are as yet inconclusive, though the lack of any similar cases reported in the rest of Libya (from where Borland imports the majority of these alchemical products for detaxion)'s export market suggests that the issue may lie with the refining mills at Haldanvion.

The particular pathophoric zoia that causes pennackit had been established in parts of India for centuries (early reports are difficult to distinguish from other dysenteric ailments, but the death of King Rahulamathavan of Madray in 1735 and several outbreaks in China over the preceding century are suspected to be of the disease), but global spread would not begin until 1753, in the aftermath of the Democratic Wars and the concomitant movement of peoples.

colombar /ˌko.lɔmˈbar/ [ˌko.lʊmˈbɑː] to beeline, to travel directly while ignoring established or more easily-traversed routes; to shortcut, skimp, cut corners, to gain a competitive or efficiency advantage especially by taking inappropriate or unsafe measures

also colombant /ˌko.lɔmˈbant/ directly, as the crow flies

Etymology: first as the participial adjective in Middle Boral colombant "in a straight line", derived from noun colomp "pigeon, dove" (modern colom "dove"), presumably in reference to the flight of homing pigeons. The word colom derives uncomplicatedly from Latin columba “dove, pigeon”. The verb per se is attested from the end of the eighteenth century, with the somewhat negative connotations arising in the following decades.

Y fraðr colombaurn dou vars y magler.

…the potential to significantly accelerate the time to send a missive long distances. But in some cases the distance need not have been particularly great—we can consider the related cases of estuaries and straits.

For example, the towns of Nausçod on Borland and Lagcóch (at this time officially Laicouche in French Guillenne) [2], being only 13 miles apart as the crow flies and the former lying atop a steep promontory, are often within clear view of each other. Before the steeplemesh, to send a letter from the one to the other would require riding to the port at Axbane and taking a ferry, likely to Heller on the mainland and then across again to Texel.

After the air-steeples connected the strait (the intermediate baskets only being necessary in conditions of weakened visibility; on clear days the sighting could be accomplished directly via a farseer) in the latter years of the 1830s, no such diversion was necessary, and one could send a letter via the post and receive a reply in less…

scorç dalassin /xɔrts ˌda.laˈsɪn/ [xɔːts ˌda.lɐˈsin] cinnamon, spice made from the dried aromatic bark of an evergreen tree native to Madray and Seldiva [1]; (more broadly) any spices made from the bark of closely related trees such as the Baigore or Chinese cassias

also dalassiner /ˌda.la.siˈnɛr/ [ˌda.lɐ.sɪˈnɛː] cinnamon tree

Etymology: the first word means "bark (of a tree), peel (of fruit)" and descends uncomplicatedly from Latin scortea "leather garment, hide", although some scholars posit that the word was borrowed from a continental form in the Old Boral period.

The second word is attested from the sixteenth century, borrowed from Suahile dalasini "cinnamon" via British (or less plausibly, Vascon) merchant traders who picked up the term in Ungotia [Zanzibar]. This word itself comes via Arabic from Persian دارچین <dárchin> "cinnamon", meaning "Chinese tree".

The word dalassin displaces older competing terms for the spice extant at the time, including zimom < Latin cinnamōmum and cannel "little reed".

No se poð ig vos affighað scorç dalassin demay.

fragment excerpted from the reference work Folk Cusdoms and Holidays oth North: a Compendium, published in 1876 by the Safford University Primers in Markland as an entry in a collaborative project spearheaded by the Rexam Indreck [non-profit] (Ymdreh Car Vantel) for outland sharing.

…origin of the beloved candied butterflies, a staple of the Borland Revillon (the Winter Feast) and there called jonnovar zucarrað, has been much debated. They have from their earliest attested iterations on the island been generously spiced, with dalassine bark and zingerroot (cinnamon and ginger) being the most popular choices.

Much as Borland—and many other places—might like to claim ownership of the concept of sugar-spiced cakebread, the basic recipe (though perhaps not the specific buttefly shape seen through winter and especially on Christ's Eve) in Europe predates even the import of sugar to the continent. Inchbread arrives in the twelfth century as ongoing warfare in the Levant brought inchroot and other goods west, often sweetened with honey.

It is usually supposed that butterflies are the primary symbol of Christide on Borland as a representation of metamorphosis and new life as the dead world of winter grows again into spring. While this makes for a good story, and while the symbol of the butterfly has over the centuries been adopted by various movements for this very purpose (consider the standard of the house of Lascoum, and more recently their incorporation into the popular conception of the vampire), the historical record is more ambiguous. In the earliest sources which connect…

colluy indrec /koˈlaj ɪnˈdrɛk/ [kʊˈlaj ɪnˈdʀɛk] charity, non-profit, organization that exists not to make money but in the pursuit of (e.g.) a charitable or educational objective

also as indrec or (colloquially) drecker /dreˈkɛr/ [dʀɪˈkɛː]

Etymology: the first word colluy "guild, gang, business, organisation" is a Middle Boral deverbal derivation from verb colluïr, which today means "to accompany, collude" but contemporaneously could be used more generally just to mean "to collaborate, work together". The verb descends directly from Latin collūdō "I play with" with a change of conjugation parallelling the development of luïr < lūdō "I play".

The second word indrec "charitable, non-profit, to the social good" is a borrowing either straight from Welsh yndreh "endeavour, undertaking" (from the verb trehu "to defeat, overcome") or, more likely, from the Merch intermediate indreck "charity, non-profit".

fuyo (goul-roug) /faˈjo gulˈruj/ robin (redbreast), one of various passerine birds having a red breast and especially the European robin Erithacus rubecula

Etymology: the epithet goul-roug (literally "red throat", the words coming directly from Latin gula rubea) is the older term, used alone for the bird since the Old Boral period. The addition (and eventual takeover) of the word fuyo occurs in the fifteenth century for unclear reasons.

The first name Fuyo is attested from around the same time as its use for the bird, which is unhelpful. It may be a rendition of a dialect pronunciation of figl "child" (or a diminutive thereof), although this doesn't explain the early variants such as sfiyo, sviogh et cetera. Attempts to connect the word to Germanic descendants of sparuó "sparrow" are phonetically untenable.

Etymology: late eighteenth century in most languages, traceable to Furlain Italian voinacciale "soldierly (informal, somewhat derogatory)". This is an adjectival derivation related to cant term voina "soldier", from either Crovatian or Zahid Russian words meaning 'soldier' or 'war'.

    short extract taken from the 1919 sensation trevold Flaxen Hearts, a work in the nascent genre of social comedy popularised by the lovetales of Clarissa Bellamy and the adolescences of Dorotha Quistack, among others. The genre is characterised by plots with low stakes, an emphasis of personal friendships and enmities, and either rural or lower-class urban settings. This book hews closely to the tropes of the genre, and like many of its ilk it is a Long Peace period story; it was written (originally in Mostara as Querdos Llinoros) by Judeta Barracin after she had returned from her years in the Arcabil.

…spectre of her absent husband, Pomona would never have been able to speak so knowledgeably on the subject of the ongoing congeries of Mendevan wars, about which Emilla had heard quite enough from her youngest brother that very morning.

The lamplighter had been and gone round the juncture onto Zanca de Molinero by the time Pomona's cavalcade of cognoscences began to wind down and smaller conversations managed to sidle in unnoticed. Emilla arose from her increasingly-uncomfortable seat by the window, rearranged the fiddliest parts of her winged shoulder pieces (recently retailored in the armourcloth style by her darling Valeria, a repatriate from an expedition to Naples in search of ever-more 'disimpecciabile' fashions), and caught the eye of her sister-in-law Zoe, whose bearing suggested her interlocutor was at least passable.

manoscart /ˌma.noˈxart/ [ˌma.nʊˈxɑːt] manoscard, a style of medieval monastic chant most popular in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and characterised by the simultaneous use of the two [major and minor] pentatonic scales; any of a range of fabrics which were a blend of two distinct fabrics, most commonly wool and linen; (more generally) hybrid, something of mixed composition, usually a combination of tools or technologies getting the benefits of each component

Caution: not used of animals or plants, for which the term mastinað "mongrel, crossbreed" is preferred.

Etymology: borrowed into early Middle Boral around the end of the twelfth century from the continent, and particularly from Burgund French art manoscard "music of Manosque". This referred to the musical tradition of this sort of chant among the religious communities of the eastern Luberon region, including the Sassenine monastery overlooking the town of Manosque.

The extension to fabric is seen first in the Italian languages in the Revitalist period, and spreads quickly along with the fashions themselves. From there its more general usage begins to be attested, but not consistently in Boral until the end of the seventeenth century.

Y refectoir vença manoscart a vigt morac eð ambrosc.

    text from a monastic chant in the manoscard mode first transcribed in the 1240s N by Stephanus of Golfhaun. It is a setting to music of the earlier poem Tanquam Ignis, which was based on the story of Pentecost. The chant is notable for containing some lyrics in the vernacular Middle Borlish of the time, as well as Borlish-influenced Latin. The sanctuary at Golfhaun is located on the island of Nestu, which is the largest landmass by far in the Labbath Sound, on whose coastline Damvath lies.

Tanquam ignis / Like fire
Illorum tu apparois / You appeared to them
Replevisque tepso / And filled them

Etymology: formed regularly in early Middle Boral from jar "clay pot" and the suffix -ry (compare veðry "glassware", argentry "silverware"). The noun comes via Norman or Vascon from Arabic جَرَّة‎ (jarra) "earthenware pot", and in the modern language has only restricted usage for small containers of medicine, spices or similar goods.

What follows is an enumeration of the "also-rans", primarily all the vocab I created incidentally for example sentences and for in-universe translations.

- arrum /aˈrɪm/ [ɐˈʀɪm] cosine (of an angle), from Arabic الرمح <ar-rumh> "the spear, the shaft". The word is spelt arrhumb in the English languages and some others, by mistaken analogy to rhumb (as in rhumb line, line which crosses successive meridians at a constant angle).

- eir doutr /ir ˈdu.tr̩/ [ɪː ˈdu.tɐ] to outdate, obsolete, outgrow, surpass, supersede, to no longer have use for; literally "to go beyond".

- staddenzan /ˌsta.dɛnˈzan/ [ˌsta.dɪnˈzan] staddenzen, local inhabitant of one of the polities that grew from early trading posts along the coasts of Cappatia [South America] and Africa; a direct borrowing from Saxon staddenzen, respelt to align with existing Boral denzan "local, denizen, citizen".

- bog /bɔj/ bow, weapon made of curved wood with ends connected by string and used for shooting arrows; borrowed from Old Norse bogi "bow". The word displaces native arc < Latin arcus, relegated in the modern language to the senses "arch (architecture), curve, part of a circle".

- bogher /bɔjˈɛr/ [bʊˈjɛː] archer, bowman, one who fights with a bow and arrow; a regular agentive derivation of the above.

- arn /ˈa.rn̩/ [ɑːn] fletch, vane, the part toward the back of an arrow, used for stabilisation during flight; probably also from Old Norse (cf. Ydreç 2008) but the etymon is unclear.

- heredical /heˌre.diˈkal/ [hɪˌʀe.dɪˈkaw] genetic, hereditary, relating to biological descent; a Scholastic Latin derivation of heres "heir, heiress".

- betraver /ˌbe.traˈvɛr/ [ˌbe.tʀɐˈvɛː] beet sugar, especially as produced from the gold braxoch beet first bred in the mid-eighteenth century; a regular adjectival derivation from betraf "beet, beetroot", which itself is a combination of earlier bet < beta "beet", raf < rapum "turnip".

- gorray /goˈre/ [gʊˈʀe] kola nut, edible seed of the kola tree used as a flavoring and as a source of caffeine; via continental Romance from one of the Bamackon languages of West Africa (cf. Wolof guru "kola nut").

- acceir /akˈsir/ [ɐkˈsɪː] to approach, gain access, consent; a regular descendant of Latin accedo "I advance, join".

- comburr /kɔmˈbɪ.rr̩/ [kʊmˈbɪ.ʀɐ] to combust, burn, to react with oxygen; a Middle Boral borrowing from Latin combūrō "I burn up, cremate, scald".

- janthin /ʒanˈθin/ [ʒɐnˈθɪn] iodine, the fourth halogen in order of molecular mass, being a purple-black solid at room temperature and pressure; a modern coinage from Greek ἰάνθῐνος <iánthinos> "violet-coloured".

- roncaf /rɔnˈkaf/ [ʀʊŋˈkaf] mystery, puzzle, conundrum, a difficult choice or decision or riddle that must be made; from the fifteenth century as rom-caf "breaks the head".

- vanagl /vaˈnɛjl/ [vɐˈnɛ.jʊ] cant, slang, jargon, the particular vocabulary shared by the members of a class or profession; not certain but usually taken to be a dialect descendant of Latin vernāculus "native, domestic, vernacular".

- veskit /veˈskɪt/ [vɪˈskɪt] jumper, sweater, cardigan, woolen garment intended to keep the wearer warm; phonetic respelling of Norman or Kentish waiscot, reduced from a compound of waist and coat (i.e. a coat reaching to the waist).

- queimasc /kwiˈmax/ [kwɪˈmax] cream cheese, soft cheese, a spreadable dairy product which is soft and mild-tasting; the exact origin is unclear but most scholars point to Portingale's queimagen "cream cheese" as the earliest-attested variation of the word.

- naf /naf/ [naf] nave, main body of a church building; from Latin navis, perhaps with some Old French influence.

- lausc /lox/ [lox] (dated) see!, I told you so!, interjection expression vindication or relief; partly from some phrases containing l'au "had it", but the origin of the coda -sc is unclear.

- crougl /krujl/ [ˈkʀu.jʊ] knuckle, crook, joints of the fingers or toes or any features of a similar shape; presumably from Old English cnucel "knuckle" but only attested from the fourteenth century.

- varrigt /vaˈrajt/ [vɐˈʀajt] tough, callused, unyielding, having formed a rough outer layer for protection; borrowed from Old English wearriht with very little change in meaning.

- auspeç /oˈspɛts/ [ʊˈspɛts] prophet, augur, one tasked with predicting the future; an early Middle Boral reborrowing from Latin auspex "augur, priest".

- ensignment /ˌɛn.sajnˈmɛnt/ [ˌɛn.sɐjmˈmɛn(t)] engraving, etching, an illustration made by carving into wood, stone or metal; nominal derivation in the Middle Boral period from verb ensignar "to engrave, carve".

- yembr scið /ˈjɛm.br̩ ˈxɪθ/ [ˈʝɛm.bɐ ˈçɪh] to realise, come to know, to become aware of a reality that has been true for some time; literally "to get known", with verb yembr "to obtain, arrive" < Latin emō "I buy, acquire" and adjective scið "known, possible" < Latin scītum "learnt, approved".

- niacer /njaˈtsɛr/ [njɐˈtsɛː] (of birds) nesting, building nests; (metaphorical, colloquial) domestic, pertaining to the household; regular adjectival derivation of niaç "nest", which is itself an extension of earlier ni < Latin nīdus "nest".

- briscel /briˈxɛl/ [bʀɪˈçɛw] bush, shrub, woody plant with multiple stems and lower height than a tree; clipped from earlier arbriscel, from a presumed Vulgar Latin arboriscellus "small tree-like plant".

- hurislar /ˌhi.riˈslar/ [ˌhi.ʀɪˈzlɑː] to rustle, crackle, to make a sound similar to that of dry leaves; from the thirteenth century in diverse forms, likely onomatopoeic but influenced in some way by Old English hrūxlian "to make noise".

- amaçgat /ˌa.matsˈgat/ [ˌa.mɐsˈgat] nursery, a room or area in a household or an external business set apart for the care of children; via Mostara or other Spanish amazgato "nursery, flowerbed, place for growing plants", from Andalus Arabic اَلْمَسْقَى‎ <al-másqa> "seedbed".

- trencsachet /ˌtrɛnk.saˈkɛt/ [ˌtʀɛŋk.sæˈkɛt] pickpocket, cutpurse, petty thief, one whose employs sleight of hand to steal from people's pockets; univerbation of trenc sachet "slices pockets".

- varmar /varˈmar/ [vɐːˈmɑː] to wriggle, squirm, to twist one's body with short writhing movements; verbal derivation from varm < Latin vermis "worm".

- connocry /ˌko.noˈkri/ [ˌko.nʊˈkʀi] ice dance, skating party, frost fair, a social occasion held on the iced-over surface of a lake or river; from Merch connockry, nominal derivation from connock "ice skate" (cf. Borlish connoc), itself from Vascon connòc /kuˈɲɔk/ < Russian конёк <kon'ok> "pony, skate".

- augtar /ojˈtar/ [ʊjˈtɑː] to deliver, convey, transport, to bring things or people to their destination; originally borrowed from Borland English ahtan "to send, give", presumably a reworking of āgan "to (cause to) own" according to aht-, the past tense root.

- paupieðr /poˈpjɛ.ðr̩/ [pʊˈpje.ðɐ] eyelid, one of the folds which can cover the eyes; regularly derived from Vulgar Latin palpetra, variant of Latin palpebra "eyelid, eyebrow".

- no spou /no spu/ [nʊˈspu] (dated) surely not!, exclamation of disbelief and surprise; contracted form of i no se poð "it isn't possible" popular in the late eighteenth century, with a revival in the early twentieth.

- trelamn /treˈla.mn̩/ [tʀɪˈla.mɐn] triangle, polygon with three sides; from Old Boral tre lamne < Latin tres laminæ "three blades" (the meaning of the noun shifting to "edge" by the Old Boral period).

- acquïr /ˌa.kwajˈɪr/ [ˌa.kwɐˈjɪː] to acquiesce, assent, consent, to be satisfied without oppositon; reborrowing from Latin acquiēscō "I rest".

1.2: bolegs "tidy"

bolegs /boˈlijz/ [bʊˈlɪjz]
- tidy, neat, arranged in order and not messily;
- (figuratively) having no unintended side-effects or consequences, proceeding as planned;
- (archaic) plentiful, enough, adequate, in a sufficient quantity for one's purposes

Etymology: first attested in 10C Old Boral as boleȝse /boˈleɣsə/ "abundant, copious, generous" and similar forms. Very likely borrowed from a northern dialect form derived from Latin prōlixē "largely, abundantly"; for the shift of initial pr- to b- compare the word bogr "not at all", definitely also of northern origin and thought to come from Latin procul "far away".

The shift to meaning "tidy, neat" is entirely complete by the eighteenth century, though older senses are retained in poetry for some time. The word's meaning seems to have passed via "polite, tactful, diplomatic"—that is, knowing what to say and when to say it—although the paucity of references suggests this usage was short-lived.

Y cambr hur noscon dað avars stan bolegs e capaç.

1.3: idoneïsar "adjust"

idoneïsar /ˌi.doˌni.iˈzar/ [ˌi.dʊˌnɪ.jɪˈzɑː]
- to adapt, adjust, tailor, to alter or modify something to conform better to a situation or for a particular use;
- to rectify, fix, redress, to correct a mistake/misstep or more generally an undesirable state of affairs

Etymology: nineteenth-century derivation unique to Boral from adjective idone /ˌi.doˈne/ "suitable, appropriate, fit, apt, proper", itself borrowed directly from Latin idoneus "suitable, convenient".

Cal voun il por lourell'erraç idoneïsar?
/kal vun ɪl pɔr luˌrɛ.lɛˈrats ˌi.doˌni.iˈzar/

1.4: storcment "blackmail"

storcment /stɔrkˈmɛnt/ [stʊːkˈmɛnt]
- blackmail, extortion, making someone give you money or other property by means of threats;
- a piece of blackmail material, something incriminating with which one might extort money from someone

Etymology: nominal derivation first attested in legal proceedings of the Middle Boral period from verb storcr "to extort, blackmail". The verb may be borrowed from Norman estorquer or may be native; either way it descends (or is an early reborrowing) from Latin extorqueō "I extort, tear away, wrench out".

Eð hour alcot es caint y storcment?

1.5: Children's Curriculum

excerpted from the supplementary notes from the 1981 Report towards a Normal Teaching for Children at Mantelschool, published (originally in Borlish as Contris vars Aðelenç Normal por Ivan a Schol Lajarn) by the contemporary Borland anthracite administration's Ministry for Schools, and intended to serve to standardise the education of children up to the age of twelve. This section is taken from the recommendations with respect to insular history.

…have at least a mozate [high-level] understanding of the development from prehistory until the time of the Second Tetrarchy, although individual schools are encouraged to include more recent material as it relates to vicine [local] matters. This may include the traditions of the local village or quarter, or else notable events (battles, discoveries, etc) which occurred nearby.

Taken in order, pupils should have the opportunity to learn about:
- waves of migration into Borland up to and including the Albic Kelts 
- - early farming and the stoneware found in the Revel mounds (compared to the better-preserved Orkney site at Scarreth [Skara Brae])
- - travel, transport and technology, including the trade necessary for bronze, the later introduction of iron, and the construction of the Çadrosc labyrinth
- - the intertribal system of hill forts in the pre-Classical period and the culture around authority, with reference to extant art, sculpture and jewellery

- classical/imperial Borland and the Romanisation of the island
- - the growth of diplomatic and trade links with Albion and Rome, between Julius Caesar's expeditions to Albion in 55 aN and the beginning of the invasion of the Northern Isles in 42 N
- - remaining Kelt kingdoms and their resistance to Roman rule through the rest of the first century (including a comparison between Buthick of the Iceni and her later imitators on Borland)
- - the ambitions of Emperor Hadrian on the Isles and the establishment of a separate Borlish province (which after the Diocletian reforms became the Boral diocese)
- - Roman culture and language as it spread across the island, including the surviving architecture (e.g. the baths in Axbane), and the urbanisation of the south and east coasts
- - the arrival of Roman Christianity on Borland and the destruction or repurposing of pagan sites, both Kelt and pantheic
- - migration of Romans from Germania Inferior, Belgica and Brittania during the decline of Roman control…

2.1: Waging World Peace

excerpt taken from 1880s-set trevold Paç Mondial Accommettent (Waging World Peace), written by Neuvort writer Dion Becolla and published in 1968 during the General Italian Fervour, although it owes more to the masquira genre in most respects.

"Façau follanç all'area fruy pre un douçur cascun triar ou?" dis Benjamin. Luy e Martha aurn toð y desc delið, e futil enter sta y residu dy collocq attendr a prolongar—lonc y bustr ig, y concið de Lucas parisce cos implausibr s'accommettr megl a sell'un.

"Let's take a spin on the dance floor before dessert, shall we?” Benjamin said. He and Martha had cleared their plates, and there was no point prolonging what remained of the conversation—in that respect Lucas' date seemed impossibly to be going better than his. Yvette was at least pretending to pay attention to Lucas' monologue.

Martha accordau, stant clar yent an conclujon cosvour.
Martha agreed, having clearly come to a similar conclusion.

Le souprenent, y domn surcou fort fruyour, ant pas leger e gournanç d'hour scur.
To his surprise, she proved a good dancer, with light steps and a good sense of timing.

As the next song started, he saw Yvette dragging Lucas onto the dance floor. Benjamin noted with approval that he held her right hand in an awkward, crushing grip—the compromise they'd reached over Lucas' unwillingness to tread on her feet. Apparently, while he had no objection to being dull, he drew the line at clumsy.

Benjamin apponoy ja oc eus. Defait de skiseç volois noc un aer de vertað por toð gent ayent le vis ne combat.
Benjamin supposed it was just as well. Feigned clumsiness wouldn't have been believable to anyone who had seen him fight.

Despite the cheap suit and the wrinkled shirt, Lucas fit in on the dance floor—sleek and graceful. Maybe enough so that Yvette would consider it worth suffering through his conversation.

2.2: fleus "velvet"

fleus /flawz/
- velvet, closely woven fabric with a thick short pile on one side
- any particularly smooth texture, especially as associated with luxury
- an orange liqueur similar in preparation to triple sec
- (cooking) coated in flour, of meat
- (slang) money, cash, when acquired illegally or dishonestly
- (child talk) teddy, stuffed animal

Etymology: the cloth sense is original, descending from Old Boral fleos et al. "fleece, wool pile", a borrowing from Old English flēos "fleece". Usage for velvet in particular seen from the fourteenth century, and extension to any luxurious texile or texture from the sixteenth.

The liqueur is a genericisation, originally used for the Fleus d'Arcabil mixer first manufactured in the early 19th century, which has entered common use in various languages. The criminal usage is roughly contemporaneous, apparently from Cappatian naval cant. The twentieth-century sense of "stuffed animal" is likely a loan translation from New Provincial vellut, which acquired that meaning some decades earlier.

Y sartour er un fleus neir embrostant.

2.3: dessoclar "to topple"

dessoclar /ˌde.soˈklar/ [ˌde.sʊˈklɑː]
- to topple, push or throw something over, especially something intentionally erected
- to overthrow a regime or oust someone from a position of authority

Etymology: from Middle Boral desçoclar "to topple, knock over", a verbal derivation from noun çocle "pedestal, plinth" (cf. modern but archaic çocr "bust, head-and-shoulders statue"). This is a thirteenth-century borrowing either from Vascon çocle "plinth" or perhaps directly from Mostara zocolo, both from Latin socculus "little shoe".

My fraðr dessoclau y castel blader meyon costroit.
/mi ˈfra.ðr̩ ˌde.soˈklo i kaˈstɛl blaˈdɛr miˈjɔn koˈstrɔjt/

##

2.4: stancour "tinker"

stancour /stanˈkur/ [stɐŋˈkʊː]
- whitesmith, person who forges things out of tin or pewter;
- tinker, repairman, person (usually itinerant) who mends household objects and appliances;
- meddler, gossip, busybody, matchmaker, one who interferes in something not of their concern

Etymology: from Old Boral istancre "whitesmith", later remodelled by analogy with the agentive -our ending (from Latin -ātōrem). This in turn is presumably—given the Gambrig chronicle's attestion of istincere "tinsmith"—a partial loan translation from Old English tincere which has the same sense, modified to conform to existing istan "tin" < Latin stannum "tin".

The extension to generic "repairman" and eventually "meddler" is ill-attested in the literature but likely around (especially in Damvath and its environs) by the seventeenth century, given the role of the recurring character Olaur in Kisneð's satirical plays.

3.2: smoutar "riot"

smoutar /smuˈtar/ [zmʊˈtɑː]
- to riot, rise up, to take part in a riot or public disturbance;
- (more generally) to act in an unrestrained or wanton manner, to indulge in excess of feasting or luxury

Etymology: seventeenth-century verbal derivation from now-obsolete smout "riot, public disturbance" (see modern smoutanç "riot", derived from the verb), which is the past participle of verb smovir "to affect, touch emotionally". Probably influenced by similar development in the Norman verb esmoveir, whose participle underwent the same semantic shift.

Y gent n'Ausçagm smoutaurn desig l'occijon.
/i ˈʒɛnt noˈsɛjm smuˈto.rn̩ deˈzaj ˌlɔk.siˈʒɔn/

3.3: sovemblar "to outline"

sovemblar /ˌso.vɛmˈblar/ [ˌso.vɪmˈblɑː]
- to sketch, outline, to draw the boundaries of a figure;
- (more generally) to make a rough or rudimentary depiction of something;
- (by extension) to describe something simply or inaccurately;
- to forge, counterfeit; to make a false reproduction of something or act as though you are someone you aren't

also deverbal sovembr /soˈvɛm.br̩/ [sʊˈvɛm.bɐ] sketch, outline; forgery, counterfeit

Etymology: from Middle Boral sowemblar "to imitate, copy (especially badly)", originally from Latin subæmulor "I emulate secretly". Whether the word is a later reborrowing or descends through Old Boral is unclear, as is whether the prefix sou- "under" is retained or a later addition. The use in the context of drawing starts to predominate from the eighteenth century onward, possibly influenced by phonetic similarity to emblem "logo, symbol" < Latin emblēma "mosaic, emblem".

Sell'amig er l'œcumen sovemblant cant nos pascau.
/ˌse.laˈmaj ɛr ˌle.kiˈmɛn ˌso.vɛmˈblant kant no paˈxo/

3.4: zygom "valve"

zygom /ziˈgɔm/ [zɪˈgɔm]
- valve, device that controls the flow of a gas or fluid through a pipe
- switch, device that controls the flow of electric current through wires
- (canal) lock, segment of a waterway enclosed by gates used to raise or lower boats
- (by extension) airlock, airtight chamber providing access to a sealed area without allowing air out or water in

also derived verb zygomar /ˌzi.goˈmar/ [ˌzi.gʊˈmɑː] to operate a valve or switch; to act as a valve or switch

Etymology: first attested in Boral from the seventeenth century, a borrowing from Scholastic Latin zygoma "(anatomy) valve, canal lock", which is from Greek ζῠ́γωμᾰ (zúgōma) "bolt, bar, yoke, cheekbone, canal lock". It displaces native sclus "canal lock" outside dialect usage by the early twentieth century. The senses "switch; airlock" are clippings of original compounds zygom baric "electric valve" and cambr zygom "valve room" respectively.

Alcun hom au y lamp fornið con zygom.

excerpted from the scitation questions given in January 2014 N for the Tremonnow Open School (formerly the Brethin Mesh Institute)'s course in concurrence history titled 844–900: Early Dane Kingdom-Building across the Northwestern Isles, which covers the transition from viking raids along the coasts of Borland, Albion and Ireland to the establishment of permanent Norse communities in those regions.

…writings on language, and discuss to what extent the 'father's name, mother's tongue' hypothesis adequately explains the persistence of Norse names long after the populations of Guile [Gael] and British Danelands were otherwise speaking the local language.

Question 7 (thirty minutes)

(i) Was it because of the Dane wayports and settlements between Dublin and Yorwick that the principality of Wynneth had the resources to consolidate primacy over Powes? Include reference to the partition of Mondwell [Anglesey] agreed between Wynneth and Sodrick, as mentioned in both the Ulstre and Carlile chronicles.
(ii) What can the life of Owain ap Blethyn—rendered into legend as Owen of Jolliad, sometime-friend sometime-foe of the Arthurians—tell us about the extent to which Welsh-born men participated in viking raids as the Dane settlements became more enmeshed with their vicinities?

The fiction of a surviving German Empire was laid to rest with the corpse of the first Kingdom of Saxony, with the domain of the Hoghbrocken dynasty reduced to their core lands upstream in Lepzi and Magdeburg.

4.2: spait "scared"

spait /spet/
- afraid, scared, frightened, feeling fear or apprehension about something;
- shy, timid, nervous, lacking in courage or confidence
- cautious, tentative, (of a person) restrained and not being assertive, (of a result) uncertain and subject to future change

Etymology: past participle of verb spagir "to frighten, to scare", itself descending unmolested from Latin expaveō "I am very afraid, I am terrified of"—although the meaning has tempered significantly over time. Extension to lack of confidence in oneself and lack of certainty in results is in evidence by the later Middle Boral period in the sixteenth century.

Jo sta spait demay a porsief luy fair.

4.3: autoschedon "hand-to-hand combat"

autoschedon /ˌo.to.skeˈdɔn/
- sparring, hand-to-hand combat (also seen adjectivally), fighting done within reach rather than at range and especially when un- or unconventially armed;
- martial art, any of several fighting styles which contain systematic methods of training for combat and often practised as sport

Etymology: borrowed into Boral and other languages in the late eighteenth century during a fashion for Classical Greek emulation, including athletic practices; adapted from the adverb αὐτοσχεδόν "hand-to-hand", literally "near themselves".

Gent ern autoschedon faint a dou lonc y torg clojonnað.

4.4: belem "scene"

belem /beˈlɛm/ [biˈlɛm]
- scene, scenery, décor, setting in which something occurs or circumstances in which a narrative (especially a play or film) takes place
- scene, discrete part of a story taking place over continuous time
- diorama, tableau, mural, model or staged version of an event or location
- (specifically) the Nativity scene, a representation of the birth of the Christchild with figurines

Etymology: borrowed in the last sense from Portingale or Leon belèm "crib, Nativity scene" in the Middle Boral period; this is a metonymic usage of proper noun Belèm "Bethlehem", from Hebrew via Latin Bethlehēmum. The word's extension to more general contexts is mostly particular to Boral, although the "diorama" sense is more widely seen.

Pre finisceu y belem, trey hom ancour forn mort.

4.5: Early Borlish Heresy

short extract taken from the 1898 reference work Sunrise in Exile: the Iconomachy in the Northern Dioceses (published originally in Borlish as Aubon n'Exigl: l'Iconomachy ny Dioces Norðer), which details the theological struggle over the veneration of images which embattled Christendom from Aghkill to Yerevan in the early medieval period. Written by former monk Mance Laurent Boneðic, the book is notable for containing discussions of several previously-unstudied primary sources retrieved from the Gulfhaven hoard.

…according to Saint Augustine. Similar argumentation can be seen in the personal writings of Psellos of Crete following his assignment to Gulfhaven in 691 N and the concomitant mission of evangelising to the Saxons (his post, it has been recently argued, manufactured in order to ablegate his influence with the Roman and Antiochine papacies).

But to mention Psellos of Crete is inevitably to discuss the Marmeronist heresy (Psellos having authored one of its foundational texts and being a testament to the theology's rapid and delocalised spread) which so alarmed the patriarchs safely ensconced at the heart of Christendom. Whether we can attribute Marmeronism to the sometimes-tenuous authority Rome held over the peripheral hierarchies—though recall that Psellos was educated in Constantinople and spent the first decades of his ministry almost as centrally-established as anyone could be—or whether the Church's practise of sending its most enthusaistic theologians to the north simply made it inevitable that novel conceptions of divinity should arise there (compare the divergent monastic practices of the insular sanctuaries of contemporary Ireland), it is nonetheless certain that…

- (archaic or ironically) gynophile, lover of women, one who appreciates the female form to an exaggerated extent

Etymology: in the first sense attested from the fourteenth century, a genericisation from renowned Athenian sculptor Praxiteles. First citation of more general use for skilled craftspeople is in the poetry of Dronimir, while the knife sense appears roughly contemporaneously in expository culinary texts.

Meaning "ski" it is a clipping of earlier sci praxitel "sculptor's ski", originally referring to a specific type of ski shaped so as to experience less friction in turns. Finally, the sculptor Praxiteles' work on the nude female body inspired the late eighteenth-century varsity slang term, which spread into more widespread use in the following decades and survives in the language mostly as a self-consciously old-fashioned term.

5.3: deðal "thimble"

deðal /deˈðal/ [dɪˈðaw]
- thimble, cup-shaped cap worn on the tip of a finger and used in sewing to push a needle through material
- thimbleful, traditional unit of liquid volume denoting as much as fits in a thimble and which is equal to roughly half a millilitre
- (by extension) a vague but small amount of liquid, especially of alcoholic spirits

Etymology: From Old Boral deiðal, de(ȝ)dal "thimble" (in various forms), descending from Latin digitālis "belonging to the finger". Coexisted with non-native thumel, an Old English borrowing, before supplanting it outside rural western dialects by the seventeenth century.

5.4: frigsar "to fry"

frigsar /frajˈzar/ [fʀɐjˈzɑː]
- to fry, to cook food in a pan with oil or similar fat
- to aggravate, provoke, incite, to cause someone or a group of people to become angry or outraged

Etymology: first attested in early Modern Boral, apparently a backformation from noun frigsoir "frying pan" and replacing earlier verb frigr < Latin frīgō "I roast, fry, parch". The noun is an Old Boral derivation with the tool suffix -oir, modelled on the past participle friȝs < Insular Latin frīxus "roasted, fried". Use of the verb in the sense "aggravate" is first seen in the nineteenth century.

J'er pol frigsant je ados cas mey.

5.5: The Mysarnos Codex

taken from popular narrative history book The Mysarnos Problem: the Enigma of an Inconvenient Codex, by classical historian Theodora Riphæna, a vocative writer who studied at the Autonome University of Thessalonica. Known for compiling centuries-spanning epics about the journey of a single idea, technology or artefact, this book on the Mysarnos Codex was published in 1943 through her alma mater's printers.

…pages rediscovered in the Library of Sobjan [Pécs, Hungary] including the vital clue: the same text—a fictionalised biography of the author—written both in Greek and in the code (as then it was still thought to be) of the manuscript.

But lest we get ahead of ourselves, let us return to the city where our saga begins. The city of Mysarnos is the former capital of the Principality of Mystra [the Peloponnese], a Roman mordether [1] vassal state from the eleventh century until its dissolution as a result of the Romantic Wars in the seventeenth. The name has retrospectively also been applied to the nearby preexisting Greek town (which was later officially incorporated as a municipality of Mysarnos) known in antiquity as Pylos.

At its height in the sixteenth century Mysarnos was a hub for the Revitalist movement, with a population of nearly thirty thousand. Located at the western end of the Athenian Way, the city recieved the majority of all trade imports in Greece. The recent completion of an extended church complex north of the city furthermore led to…

Though he was not particularly martial-minded, Andrew's uncompromising tactical nous and cavalier disregard for simple diplomacy meant I would likely languish as a prisoner at Safford Castle indefinitely, or until he could put me to some better use.

6.2: nacleu "slope"

nacleu /naˈklaw/
[noun]
- slope, incline, gradient, an area of ground that tends evenly upward or downward;
- slope, gradient, the extent to which an area of ground tends upward or downward;
- (mathematics) derivative, gradient, the slope of the tangent line to a curve at a point or the function defining the slope at all points;
[adjective]
- sloping, inclined, tending evenly upward or downward;
- oblique, askew, neither in line with nor perpendicular to a given base;
- awry, off-course, crooked, improperly out of place
- (by extension) amiss, fishy, suspicious, having gone wrong or being faulty/othrwise incorrect;
[adverb]
- uphill, downhill, in a direction along a slope or incline;
- off course, in an unintended or unfavourable direction

Etymology: first seen in Old Boral n(e) acliv /n aˈklɪw/ "uphill", an adverb formed by the fusion of preposition ne "in" with acliv < Latin acclīvis "sloped, rising, steep". To explain the early broadening also to "downhill, sloped downward", some have suggested influnce from a word *decliv < dēclīvis "sloping downward", but this is not attested in Old Boral text.

In the Middle Boral period the word quickly gains traction as an adjective (the metaphorical extensions to "awry, off course" occurring in both parts of speech simultaneously). As a noun it only overtakes now-obsolete appent "slope" < appendr "to lean, tilt" in the seventeenth century.

6.3: voncir "wax"

voncir /vɔnˈtsɪr/ [vʊnˈtsɪː]
- wax, any oily solid or semisolid substance and usually long-chain organic compounds;
- (specifically) beeswax, secreted by bees from which they make honeycomb;
- polish, glaze, shiny protective (especially waterproof) coating, traditionally consisting of beeswax

Etymology: the word appears in various forms in Old Boral—voncer, vounceir "beeswax", among others—and while the second syllable descends unproblematically from Latin cēra "wax, beeswax, honeycomb", the first syllable is of unclear etymology. 

Most accepted (though rather ad-hoc) is the theory that the first syllable derives from Old Engish bēon "bees", possibly influenced in its first consonant by Old Boral aveȝle "bee" < Latin apicula "little bee". Less likely is compounding with a hypothetical Old Boral word *awon /awˈvɔn/ "beehive", which could descend regularly from a Latin *alvō, alvōnis, an unattested declension variant of alvus/alveus "hollow, cavity, beehive".

6.4: zachet "glue"

zachet /zaˈkɛt/
- adhesive, glue, a substance that binds things together
- (especially) mortar, grout, mixture of lime or cement, sand and water used in construction as a binding agent
- solder, easily-melted alloy, often of tin and lead, used to mend or join metal objects

Etymology: from the thirteenth century in Middle Boral zachet "mortar", a borrowing from Barcelon or Mostara zaqueta "mortar, cement". This comes from earlier lazaco, lazaqueta via reanalysis of the first syllable as the definite article, and is a borrowing from Andalus Arabic لَزَاق <lazāq> "adhesive, glue".

The rebroadening of the word to "adhesive" in later Boral has been used to suggest that zaqueta itself was once used more broadly, but there is no textual evidence of this. In its metallurgical sense it is seen from the eighteenth century as a clipping from zachet metal "metal glue".

6.5: The Mysarnos Codex, cont.

further excerpt from history book The Mysarnos Problem: the Enigma of an Inconvenient Codex, written in 1943 by classical historian Theodora Riphæna.

…north of the city furthermore led to a theological flourishing both before and after the Great Fracture which so severely hobbled the Roman Papacy.

The name of the city itself is usually held to refer to the venerable maple trees for which region has been known since Classical times; most suggestive is modern Welsh mysarn "maple wood", but also compare Kentish mazre, Vascon mausòn "maple".

The author of the Mysarnos Codex has never been conclusively identified, and this book will not pretend to have done so; what is relatively certain is that it was composed—or at least first stored—at the Library of Saint George the Martyr, one of the largest buildings within the aforementioned church complex. What is frustrating is that we have access to extant and complete membership records for the various monasteries and other institutions in the area for almost the entire sixteenth century, and biographical information for many among them. Nonetheless, no mention is made by any of the surviving chronicles of the production of the Mysarnos Codex.

Originally comprising over two hundred illustrated vellum folios lined with incomprehensible but clearly meaningful symbols (at most 200 different glyphs—occasionally it can be difficult to tell if two glyphs are merely stylistic variations of each other or different glyphs entirely—appear through the entire codex), the text has baffled historians and linguists for centuries. The illustrations range from the utterly mundane to the fantastical; on either side of a spread one might see both a field of poppies and armoured men on the backs of four-winged dragons. Assuming the text must refer in some way to these depictions, many have tried to…

7.2: yarç "grate"

yarç /jarts/ [ʝɑːts]
- (obsolete or dialect) harrow, device dragged along ploughed land to break up the soil;
- portcullis, gate in the form of a grating which is lowered into place at the entrance to a castle or fort;
- trellis, pergola, grating in the form of walls or a passageway used to support climbing plants;
- (by extension) lattice, grate, grill, frame formed of both horizontal and vertical strip of material often used to allow small objects to pass through while large objects cannot

Etymology: from Old Boral yarce, yerce "harrow, portcullis" (among other attested forms), itself from Medieval Latin hercia "harrow", which presumably derives from Classical hirpex, hirpicis with the same meaning (although the phonetic development is unclear).

Use for portcullises is very early, while extension to gardening and more general usage is only attested from the fifteenth century, particularly with reference to gratings used to catch specific types of fish.

7.3: vorpal "diced"

vorpal /vɔrˈpal/ [vʊːˈpaw]
- diced, cut into small cubes as a preparation in cooking;
- cubic, boxy, having the shape of a cube
- (of lodgings) cramped, not spacious, uncomfortably restricted in size or space
- pixellated, blocky, of disappointingly low resolution

Etymology: originally in the culinary sense, a borrowing in the late eighteenth century from Normal vourpel "diced", itself from Saxon wurpel "die, cube". This is a native word descending from Classical German vurpilas "die" (compare Bavarn würfil with the same meaning).

To refer to housing it is attested since the nineteenth century, at around the same time as the use for imagery—in that sense, it is an 1821 calque from Provincial icon dau "die image" used to criticise the newly unveiled Steeplepost Tapestry in Ambrosia.

7.4: kyriel "gamut"

kyriel /kiˈrjɛl/ [ˌkɪ.ʀɪˈʝɛw]
- (dated) a sort of short Christian prayer set to music;
- (musical) scale, sequence of notes usually contained within a single octave;
- procedure, rigmarole, a particular (often long or tiresome) method for performing a task
- range, gamut, spectrum, a complete selection of things;
- scope, compass, reach, the full extent within some scale that can be obtained or managed

Etymology: borrowed in the sixteenth century from French kyrielle, referring both to prayer set to music and to a musical scale (originally in particular the Phrygian mode, but by the time it was borrowed the usage had broadened). This word is a diminutive of kyrié, itself originally from Greek Κύριε ἐλέησον <Kúrie eléēson> "Lord, have mercy".

7.5: The Terrene Tax

excerpt taken from the condensed study materials (2008 N, fourth edition) for the course Histoir Concorrent, s16 : Mort, Vascel eð y Motion Celest (in English, Concurrence History of the 16th Century: Death, Ships and the Movement of the Heavens) taught at the New Vithor School and based on the normal itineraries from Cordin Editions.

…saphires purpel and petal embroderie” to church, although the veracity of this account is disputed.

However, one should be careful not to construe the strengthening negotiating position of the peasantry with respect to their landlords as a broad levelling of the hierarchies of sixteenth-century Europe. In many places central authorities (usually monarchs, although bear in mind the Latin republics—in particular Provence—as well as the eastern patriarchates) took swift advantage of the local nobility's declining power in order to consolidate their own. For example, it has been argued that this process in Rome led directly to the Great Fracture and the accession of the Triunvirato (about which more in Section 13: Revitalist Art and Theory).

After the death of Joseph III in 1534 N (accusations of an unnatural demise have been sporadically levelled but are unsubstantiable), his nephew and successor Brandon II almost immediately sought to exploit his position by levying a terrene tax on landholders across the land. His uncle having never succeeded in producing a natural-born heir, despite several illegitimate children by his various mistresses, Brandon would have been well aware of his inheritance and seems to have spent much of the decades prior winning hearts and minds at court.

There are two consequences of this tax which we will discuss here. The first is that, due to the necessity of an accurate account of the land held by…

8.2: sviðour "fan"

sviðour /sviˈður/ [zvɪˈðʊː]
- (archaic) day labourer, itinerant worker, one who travels to find employ which is usually temporary and revocable at any time
- patron, regular, customer of an establishment who is a reliable source of custom and so is well-known there
- fan, enthusiast, aficionado, one who admires a particular person or thing usually to the point of zealotry

Etymology: originally in the first sense (all the newer senses are attested from the late nineteenth century only), having shifted slightly from the more specific "(itinerant) farm labourer". In this use it is an agentive derivation from earlier (and similarly archaic) svið "area of farmland, especially one that has been newly-cleared for cultivation".

This noun descends from Old Boral svið(re) "field cleared by burning; the practice of clearing fields for cultivation by burning", which is a borrowing either from Old Norse sviða "to burn" or from sviðna "to be burnt".

Jo no sta jamay sviðour de fic.

8.3: goðamer "bigoted"

goðamer /ˌgo.ðaˈmɛr/ [ˌgo.ðɐˈmɛː]
- sectarian, dogmatic, expressing fervent support for one set of religious beliefs over others or being unduly concerned with distinctions between people of different religious beliefs
- parochial, narrow-minded, having restricted or rigid views and being unreceptive to new ideas or focusing on local concerns to the exclusion of wider contexts
- (less charitably) bigoted, prejudiced, intolerant, forming negative opinions of groups of people without just cause

Etymology: adjectival derivation from goðam "sectarian person, dogmatist, chauvinist, bigot", itself attested from the early Middle Boral period originally in the sense "religious hypocrite, sanctimonious person, holier-than-thou person".

This comes from thirteenth-century French (likely Norman) godame, which was first used to refer to the Kentish and other English people in a derogatory manner, and is an adaptation of oath "God damn (thee)". Some commentators have suggested a source in various crusader bands of mixed Kentish and Norman soldiers, although there was sufficient contact ordinarily that such a supposition is not particularly necessary.

8.4: quagl "quail, curds"

quagl /kwɛjl/ [ˈkwɛ.jʊ]
(1)
- quail, any of various small game birds related to pheasants or partridges, or the meat from such a bird eaten as food
- (more generally) quarry, an animal which is hunted or by extension a person or object which is being pursued
(2)
- curds, the part of milk that coagulates when it sours or is treated with enzymes
- any of several pressed, unmatured cheeses made from curdled milk with a high melting point and therefore popular in fried dishes

Etymology: in the senses at (1), a descendant of Late Latin quaccola "quail" with a somewhat irregular outcome—we would expect quacr /ˈkwa.kr̩/. One way to resolve this is to hypothesise an intermediate variant *quacula having undergone degemination; another is to suggest that the word was reborrowed from Old French coaille, which has the same origin. The metaphorical extension to other sought-after things is attested from the poetry of the sixteenth century, though is likely earlier.

In the senses at (2), a descendant of Late Latin quāglum < coāgulum "milk curd", reinforced by Portingale or Leon quallo from traders in the Old Boral period (explaining the retention of initial qu- where we would expect c-).

…his thrice great-grandfather Vigo the Magnificent, however tempting the comparison might be from a modern perspective.

Crowned only three years earlier in 883 N and having already suffered the blow of losing the Siege of Avron and ceding the fort and town to the expanding territories of Duke Fargot, who had been appointed by Rothed the Canny to the march, Alan III of Dumnonia cannot be said to have enjoyed an auspicious early reign. Almost the only source of stability in the realm was the loyalty of his vassal and nephew Gorvan of Kernow (or Golleck, accounts differ) to whom Alan had granted dominion of Devon.

Most pressing was the inexorable rise in Viking activity along the coast. Raids along the Seine and the Orne had begun in earnest some decades prior, but now spread west; even the monastery at Landvennick was burned to the ground in 888 N. Nor were the Danes' activities confined to looting; on both sides of the Channel war leaders took advantage of political instability (the collapse of Wessex in the north and the Lombard disputes in the south) to conquer territory and settle. There is evidence of such Danish settlement even past the Vire river, part of the Franco-Dumnonian border as agreed in the eighth-century Catumagin Accords, although when this fiefdom was officially ceded by the Franks in the tenth century to form Normandy the Vire remained the border.

Later in-migration of the Normans (including here in Thelmass) aside, one might be forgiven for imagining that a weakened Frankish presence at Dumnonia's borders would be a boon for…

9.2: fabr "tale"

fabr /ˈfa.br̩/ [ˈfa.bɐ]
- tale, story, narrative, the account of a sequence of events with strong connotations of being fictional (compare stoir, narrað);
- play, production, performance, story told via live actors in a theatre;
- (by extension) drama, adventure, excitement, implausible events resembling those of popular theatre;
- (in philosophy) matter, concern, a particular topic under discussion or relevant to a scenario

Etymology: from Old Boral fable "fable, tale" a semi-learned borrowing (possibly via Old French) from Latin fabula "narrative, story". Seen in the sense of "play" from the thirteenth century, which may be an independent development or perhaps influenced by Classical usage of fabula to mean "poem, dramatic narration".

9.3: vivirc "leeway"

vivirc /viˈvirk/ [vɪˈvɪːk]
- legroom, breathing space, room to move, adequate space such that one does not feel constrained;
- leeway, latitude, margin, an amount of freedom or flexibility to change to make alternative decisions or to pursue other courses of action, especially any involving only minor alterations to one's present situation or course;
- respite, downtime, a moment between work or other activity for one to recover one's breath

Etymology: of unclear origin, but attested from the fourteenth century in the first sense. Thought to be related to Sothbar dialect term vrikir "to squirm, wriggle", which is a borrowing from Germanic (probably Old Dutch, cf. modern wricke "to pry, wrench").

The first syllable is somewhat problematic; ideophonic reduplication is possible but not otherwise seen in the language. The suggestion of Yaskirç that it descends from Latin via "road, way, route" is not generally credited.

Metaphoric extension to leeway in general and downtime in particular is seen with certainty from the latter half of the seventeenth century, although the development is likely earlier (as the new senses appear in texts from different areas almost simultaneously, implying that they were well-established in the lexicon).

Nos n'arreu magn vivirc neðan y scon vec kiglar.

9.4: vabian closnautr "ramshackle"

vabian closnautr /vaˈbjan kloˈsno.tr̩/ [vɐˈbjan klʊˈzno.tɐ]
- dilapidated, tumbledown, ramshackle, in a deplorable state lacking maintenance and upkeep;
- obsolete, deprecated, antiquated, no longer in use or neglected in favour of something newer;
- void, null, invalid, no longer having any effect or now being considered irrelevant

Etymology: compound of the two Middle Boral words vabȝan "woebegone, in a sorry state" and closnautre "beset, hagridden, burdened", originally both in reference to people. The former is borrowed from Old English wābegān "beset by woe", while the latter descends (it is thought, via some vulgar adverbial form) from Latin clausus "enclosed, shut off, inaccessible".

The shift from referring to people towards referring to buildings or vehicles (and later in extended use as above) took place slowly in the Revitalist and Romantic periods and was complete by the turn of the eighteenth century; in modern usage, if the word refers to a person it references their outdated fashions, affect or beliefs and not their emotional state.

9.5: Roman-Celtic Syncretism

extract taken from historical reference The Boral Province in the century after Hadrian, published in 1952 (originally in Borlish as Y Provinç Boral par siecr posc Hadrian) by Cordin Editions and written by concurrence (in this case, late classical) historian Robiaut Scarvon.

…shrine to Vulcan seen in the aftermath of his failed rebellion in the first century N as an aspect of Govan, the Keltic god of smithcraft.

Just as the Romans did across the rest of the empire (particularly in Greece and Egypt, about which see Trabont 39), the pre-existing sacred practices and divinities on Borland were interpreted through the lens of and recast in the mould of the Roman pantheon. This could be based on really quite tenuous analogies—for example, the old worship of Nahalennia along the southern and western coasts of the island, who was a goddess of trade and the ocean, was absorbed for unclear reasons into the cult of Pluto and she was syncretised with his wife Proserpina (Hamerton 41 has suggested a link via wealth; Pluto/Dis Pater is connected to the mineral wealth of the earth).

Other deities were more localised or connected inextricably to particular geographical features, and as such could be incorporated painlessly into the Roman religious landscape. Just as there was Tamesis in Britannia and Sequana in Gaul, the river now called Reim was once personified as the god Reagimos (also seen in inscriptions as Drahimus and less commonly with multiple other spellings). Some years ago the remains of a marble temple built some decades after the founding of the Roman city of Pons Seianus were unearthed, revealing…

10.1: The Emeralds are a Red Herring

excerpt in translation from trevold Y Smaraut son Piescrat "The Emeralds are a Red Herring", one of the early successes in the housebound enigma genre. Written in 1908 by Ausçagm-born author Norrasc Yvauron, the idea for the novel and in particular its Ambrosian setting were likely inspired by her travels in Mendeva and her time in the literary circles of Zaigmonisca.

"Or." Hemma parolau de vois kieð demay. 
“Well." Hemma's voice was too calm. 

"Vray dis jo incoïbr es traiçon. Por mell'envou, repars tu for oy calscon bravur exiguous teyon accomblabr zelous, ben es tu un pascaret trayour lonc y mesur?"
"I did say it always ends in betrayal. Out of interest, did you only now lose whatever excuse for a spine you possess, or have you been a treacherous little rat all along?"

Marça’s eyes narrowed. “Surely you didn’t, Monick.”

10.2: sbolognment "burden"

sbolognment /ˌsbo.lɔjnˈmɛnt/ [ˌzbo.lʊjmˈmɛn(t)]
- chore, burden, onus, an unwanted obligation imposed upon one;
- (more concretely) encumbrance, load, something unwieldy to carry around with one

Etymology: sixteenth-century noun derivation from verb sbolognar "to foist upon, saddle with", borrowed from synonymous Italian sbolognare in the Revitalist period. This verb is presumably a pejorative derivation from the name of the city Bologna, although the cultural context that led to the current sense is not well understood.

10.3: outrscac "brazen"

outrscac /ˌu.tr̩ˈxak/ [ˌu.tɐˈxak]
- (archaic, poetic or tongue-in-cheek) unconstrained, free, not subject to physical restraint or bondage;
- unrestrained, immoderate, not held in check by convention or social pressure;
- shameless, unblushing, impudent, audacious, brazen, acting boldly or shockingly in the teeth of (felt or expected) embarrassment

Etymology: from early Middle Boral expression outre scac "(in chess) not capable of being put in check" (literally "beyond check"), quickly extended to simply mean "not subject to any compulsion or restraint".

The preposition, which in modern Boral has shifted to outr "complete, total, absolute", descends from Latin ultra "beyond". The noun scac "chess; check" descends from Medieval Latin scaccus "check", originally from Persian شاه‎ (šâh, “king”).

Nos voum noc sy volary outrscac venjar ou?

10.4: gam sgarant "wanderlust"

gam sgarant /gam sgaˈrant/ [ˌgan.zgɐˈʀan(t)]
- wanderlust, itchy feet, a strong impulse or longing to travel;
- malaise, a generalised sense of dissatisfaction with one's current circumstances

Etymology: the phrase literally means "legs wandering" and is attested from the eighteenth century. The noun gam descends from Late Latin gamba, which itself is from Ancient Greek κάμπη (kámpē)  "turn, bend".

The verb sgarar "to wander, get lost" comes from Old Boral isgarar "to lead astray", a borrowing from Old French esgarer in the same sense. This is a derivation of garer "to place, position" which is from Frankish warón "to guard, keep watch".

Gam sgarant me cof donc j'enfugheu.

10.5: Middlesea Meals

excerpt from acclaimed 1880 mealbook Pasti Mezziterreni (Middlesea Meals). The book was written by world-traveller Josforo Sant'Angelo, youngest son of the last Marksman of Cremuna, and it popularised the use of autobiographical anecdotes to separate and give context for the various recipes within.

Cypriot Pan-Farrago (Χαλουμ Κομαρ)

Unless you have the good fortune to hail from the sea-Masreck (although I hear the Cappatian staddenzen have a similar cheese, there made of course with cow's milk), you will need to content yourself to brine-stored Cypriot cheese which, while perfectly appetising in this traditional mélange, is unlikely to match the exquisite meal I took by the sea after a day spent among the ruins of Knossos. One might object that I must simply have been swept up in grandeur, carried along by the weight of aeons behind me; for my part I am inclined to credit the chef.

Wares (for six)
- olive oil
- 4 large tartover [potatoes] per cubos
- several stalk-onions, chopped, bulb and stem apart
- fine jarraspepper spice
- 1п round of Cypriot cheese or other curd per frangos
- 6 eggs

Method
First heat some oil in a broad pan and fry the tartover over gentle fire for a quarter-hour, often stirred (until the pieces crispen and the flesh becomes soft). Add in the stalk-onion bulb and the jarraspepper and cook a little longer.

Subside the mix and heat more oil in the pan, on which fry the cheese until golden. Bring together the tartover and cheese and fully involve while including salt and drypepper in whichever amount suits.

Divide the farrago by covered bowls and hold near the fire, then crack the eggs into the seasoned pan and fry as desired. Finally place the eggs atop each dish and scatter with the rest of the stalk-onion.

11.2: scompigl “turmoil”

scompigl /xɔmˈpajl/ [xʊmˈpa.jʊ]
- disruption, turmoil, upheaval, a state of rapid change and impermanence as an interruption to  the flow or sequence of something;
- (more generally) havoc, chaos, widespread devastation or mayhem

also scompiglar /ˌxɔm.pajˈlar/ [ˈxɔm.pɐjˈlɑː] to disrupt, to thow into chaos

Etymology:  Borrowed in both noun and verb forms from Italian scompiglio, scompigliare "(to cause a) mess" in the Middle Boral period. The Italian is a derivation of pigliare "to grab", which descends from Latin pilō  "to pull out hair, to plunder"—whence also Boral piglar "to loot,  pillage" (which may have influenced the modern meaning).

    Alcun hom sceu y scompigl redugr ny vesteul.

11.3: udomintel “babysitter”

udomintel /iˌdo.mɪnˈtɛl/ [ɪˌdo.mɪnˈtɛw]
- (dated) nanny, wet nurse, a woman hired to suckle and otherwise look after another woman's infant child;
- babysitter, childminder, person who cares for one or more children for a short period of time in place of their legal guardians

Etymology: nineteenth-century borrowing from Italian udomintello "nursemaid, wet nurse", which is an adaptation of earlier and synonymous Furlain udomitel; the insertion of -n- is thought to be by analogy with other household words from the Latin words domus "house", dominus "master, lord". In turn, the Furlain is taken from neighbouring Crovatian udomiteł "foster parent, adoptive parent", an agentive derivation of udomiti "to shelter, give home to".

11.4: vunnastr “merry”

vunnastr /viˈnas.tr̩/ [vɪˈnas.tɐ]
- merry, jolly, festive, full of high spirits and inclined to celebrate;
- (of music) brisk, lively, at a fast tempo and with a light-hearted mood;
- tipsy, a bit drunk, slightly inebriated as one might be at a holiday party

Etymology: from Old Boral wunuast(re) "joyful, joyous", the first part of which is thought to be cognate to Old English wynn "joy, happiness". Direct borrowing of the noun is considered unlikely, however, since it was uncommon in prose and usually confined to poetry. The most commonly held view is that the Old Boral is borrowed from the derived adjective wynfæst "joyful", with the final -r being a later addition by analogy with other adjectives ending in -astre < Latin -aster, -astrum.

    Nos broucaum un crevoscr vunnastr accougl.

11.5: 14C Manoscard Music

excerpt from 1976 scholastic quire Shallmews and Fithels: the influence of post-Tetrarchic Hymnal Practice on Popular Music, a textbook of musical history written by clavierman Morency Rivellerson through the Tommarth University Faculty of Domain History's primers in collaboration with the city's Lady Maud Orchestra Public Indreck.

…in the 'farmer duke' tradition of folktales whose interstitial melodies and songs constitute some of the very earliest extant examples of this lineage of musical notation; thanks to recent archival work at the Academy in Santrafew (more about which see chapter 8), we can stage modern performances of this pieces on replica instruments and hear just what the fair-goer of the fourteenth century would have heard.

Nonetheless, the character of these pieces draws upon yet earlier innovations about which we can only make educated guesses. What to make, for example, of the shared use of the manoscard scale [an octatonic scale being the union of the major and minor pentatonic scales] in many of these works? Traditionally we conceive of the manoscard as a Burgund innovation of the late twelfth century, beginning with hymns performed in the religious communities of the eastern Luberon region (and in particular the Sassenine monastery overlooking Manosque, whence the name).

By the time we do have evidence of manoscard melody in contemporary popular music, we see use of the scale across western Europe as far north as Mondwell [Anglesey] and as far south as Bagliemmo [Palermo], so it is difficult to determine its true homeland. The presumption that it radiated from Luberon through Burgundy and outward through the thirteenth century is as well-evidenced as any alternative hypothesis, which is to say not particularly convincingly. Some scholars have argued that the direction of influence was in fact the reverse, and the scale was brought to Manosque by a young monk who had it from his childhood village. As neither the origins nor even the birthnames of the…

- (proscribed) wordsearch, a word game comprising a grid of letters in which are hidden given words;
- (jocular) word salad, any difficult-to-parse or deliberately obscurantist prose

Etymology: literally "grid-shaped word-game", formed from the noun scarrad "riddle, verbal puzzle, word game" and the adjective yarcer "in the shape of a grid/lattice/grill".

The noun is a fourteenth-century borrowing from Middle French charrade "riddle, idle chatter", itself from Aquitain, while the adjective is a derivation of yarç "portcullis, grate, grill, lattice, harrow" from Medieval Latin hercia of the same meaning.

moðnaut /mɔðˈnot/ [mʊðˈnot]
- sailor, seaman, mariner, person in the business of navigating ships or a member of the crew of such;
- fellow, chap, man, a male person often held in some regard by the speaker

Etymology: from Middle Boral moðnaut "sailor", of uncertain origin. Most likely, although somewhat phonetically implausible, is that is descends from Middle Dutch matenout "bunkmate" < mate "mat, hammock" and henout "companion" (whence also Middle French matelot "sailor" and thus Kentish mattlet "(lower) seaman, below-decks shipworker".

Alternatively, an earlier origin in the (probably Horther) Old Norse compound møtu-nautr "food companion" has been proposed; some also claim that this is the original etymon later influenced in meaning by the Middle Dutch above. Despite superficial similarity, certainly unrelated to Latin nauta or Greek ναύτης <naútes> "sailor".

- (of an insect) crawl, skitter, move nimbly with fast leg movements and especially along a wall or a ceiling;
- (by extension, of a person) manoeuvre oneself adroitly through difficult terrain or metaphorically through awkward circumstances

Etymology: originally in the first sense only, from Old Boral fladrar, flaðrar "to climb, scale", from Borland English hlǣdran "to climb (a ladder)", itself a derivation from noun hlǣder "ladder". Extension to insect movement is attested from the fourteenth century.

Dou aragn son y platcouf flaðrant.

13.2: hortumesc "filthy"

hortumesc /ˌhɔr.tiˈmɛx/ [ˌhɔː.dɪˈmɛç]
- filthy, muddy, covered with dirt or other unpleasant stuff;
- profane, unholy, vulgar, ritually impure or treating religious matters with disrespect

Etymology: adjectival derivation of noun hortum "filth, profanity", which likely originates in Latin sorditūdō "dirt", itself a nominal derivation of verb sordeō "I am dirty".

The unusual phonetic development can be partially explained. The unproductive ending -tum comes from Vulgar Latin -tūminem, a dissimilated form of -tūdinem (the accusative of -tūdō); see also soltum "loneliness". The shift of initial s > h is less explicable, though some have suggested influence from Borland Celtic.

- (more generally) a small flow of any liquid, as of water poured from a handheld vesssel

also a groglon "(of alcohol etc) on tap, available directly from a barrel or other storage by means of a valve"

Etymology: via metathesis from Old Boral gorȝlon /gɔrˈʎɔn/ "flow of water, small stream", itself descending from Latin gurguliō "windpipe, gullet". It is plausible that its use in reference to drinking is retained from the Latin, but it is not attested in writing until the fifteenth century.

- excursion, jaunt, outing, night out, a recreational trip especially lasting the evening and into the night;
- (obsolete) the Revillon, the evening meal eaten the night before Christmas usually in a public hall

Etymology: from Middle Boral jolveisr "Revillon", itself from Old Boral iolveisle with the same sense. Possibly influenced in form by Old French jolif "merry, joyful" (which may have been borrowed into southwestern dialects of Middle Boral; attestations are alleged but uncertain). The source of the Old Boral is in Norse jólveizla "Yule feast", a transparent compound (cf. modern Horther veizel "banquet").

Nos coum tout eurað par un grand jolleistr.

1500: The length in leagues of Japetos III, the new Atlantic link laid down between Morrack and Ambrosia which conveyed its first messages this last Wednesday. Originally conceived by the two administrations in concert in 1943, the endeavour was delayed several times due both to budgetary concerns and, of course, the outbreak of war. The cable connects the cities of Gadire on the river Soux [Agadir, Morocca] and Paratzon in eastern Brasil [St John's, Newfoundland].

Proponents have (depending on their sympathies or lack thereof regarding the Collusion) pointed variously to the benefits of relying less on Drengot astraphor [electricity] and of elevating Lisbon's Faculty of Alchemy to a hub on the world stage.

14.2: gimmoldr "toil"

gimmoldr /giˈmɔl.dr̩/ [gɪˈmɔw.dɐ]
- to toil, strive, to work hard in pursuit of some goal;
- to endeavour, to have a mission and be dedicated to its fruition;
- to be responsible for the accomplishment of an ongoing endeavour or event, especially of a religious ritual
- to preside over an instance of such an event or ritual

Etymology: from Old Boral gimmolre "to perform the Eucharist", from a conflation of Latin verb immolō "I sacrifice, immolate" (cf. modern immolar "to destroy by fire") with the related molō "I grind, mill". Excrescence of the initial g- is unexplained, leading some to propose an alternative origin in an unattested phrase gib molre, in which the first word is borrowed from Old Norse gipt "gift, good luck". The shift in Middle Boral to mean "endeavour, toil" is likely due to semantic influence from parallel moldr "to grind".

Vos gimmoloist a remanir ne cognit.
/vɔz ˌgi.moˈlɔjst a ˌre.maˈnɪr ne kɔjˈnɪt/

14.3: vesson "outfit"

vesson /veˈsɔn/ [vɪˈsɔn]
- outfit, get-up, attire, a set of clothing worn together along with related accessories;
- uniform, costume, dress, a distinctive set of clothing used to identify the wearer as a member of some group

Etymology: from Middle Boral vesçon "outfit, set of clothes" and earlier Old Boral, descending from Insular Latin vestiō, vestiōnem "clothing, dressing (someone)". This is a form of synonymous Latin vestītiō which underwent haplology.

Laisc ty vesson e met tey ne quil!
/lex ti veˈsɔn e mɛt ti ne kwɪl/
[leç ti vɪˈsɔn e mɛt ti ne kwɪw]

14.4: ja galað "come to that"

ja galað /ʒa gaˈlaθ/ [ʝa gɐˈlah]
- come to that, for that matter, as far as the current topic is concerned;
- speaking of, relatedly, on a topic related to the one currently under discussion

Etymology: adverbial expression first seen in early Modern Boral, literally meaning "already escorted" or "still accompanying". The particle ja "now, already, still, ever" (also "yes", in which sense it comes from Germanic) descends uncomplicatedly from Latin iam "already".

The past participle galað from verb galar "to escort, accompany, take with one" (and also "to court, woo, step out with", its original sense) is a backformation from galant "courteous, chivalrous"; this is a borrowing from the homonymous Middle French, which derives from gale "pomp, festivity, mirth", of obscure origin.

Jo n'ay tag beut par monð, ja galað.
/ʒo ne tɛj bawt par mɔnθ | ʒa gaˈlaθ/
[ʝo ne tɛj bawt pɑː mɔnθ | ʝa gɐˈlah]

14.5: Ambrose III of Vascony

collation of all the information I have written elsewhere about King Ambrose III of Vascony, and a map of the territory of Vascony at his accession in 1456 N.

Ambrose III (17 March 1435–28 February 1518), also called Ambrose the Ascendant, ruled the Vascon Kingdom of Navar and Aquitain (Vascony) from 1456 until his death at the age of 83. His father, Prince Mark of Tolose, predeceased him in 1453 when he was 18 years old, and so he ascended to the throne upon the death of his grandfather Ambrose II (after the brief and swiftly-resolved Avalot Planzo) three years later.

At the start of Ambrose III's reign, the country was at its territorial maximum, having conquered northern Portingale (all of Galice and as far south as Braga and—nominally—Calès) and southern Burgundy (which is to say, enough of Provence to share a border with the Italian states of Jeans and Lombardy) during the reign of his grandfather Ambrose II.

Ambrose III is most remembered for ruling through the European discovery of the Novomund in 1471 by ships of the New Navarre Enterprise, a guild established by royal decree in 1458 which aimed primarily to solidify Vascon supremacy in the trade of North Atlantic fish through the Middlesea. British dominion over the Atlantic had long frustrated Vask fishing families, members of which still predominated in the aristocracy and held significant political power in Ambrose's court.

The decades following the Novomundine Landfall brought new prosperity to Vascony, and in particular to Portingale, leading the Vascon Ascendancy (which most historians mark as beginning near the turn of the fifteenth century) to its height.

The king's long and acrimonious relationship with King Munir al-Hamdawi of Morrack (born in 1429 and reigning for a comparable length of time) grew from a childhood enmity to a bitter naval and martial feud, especially after the rest of Portingale fell to Morrack in 1457 N.

The latter years of his reign were marked by decline: the Kingdom of Burgundy retook Provence in 1494 (sparking the 1497–99 War of Provincial Independence), and a decade later the remainder of Vascony's Middlesea coast was taken by Barcelon.

Ambrose III was the eldest son of Prince Mark of Tolose and Margaret of Iscombe. He had a sister, Princess Alexandra, and two younger siblings, Prince Victor of Astorga and Princess Natalia. Although he never married (the cause in part of the instability that plagued his later years), he is thought to have kept several lovers throughout his life, although there is no unimpeachable proof that any of the proposed candidates were his lover.

15.2: youdar "numb"

youdar /juˈdar/ [ʝʊˈdɑː]
- to numb, deaden, to cause a sensation (physical or emotional) to become less intense;
- to dull, blunt, to lessen the sharpness of an edge;
- to mitigate, palliate, extenuate, to lessen the harmful or otherwise negative impact of something

Etymology: from Middle Boral youdar, itself from Old Boral ievdar "to blunt, dull (an edge)" with unexplained vowel shift (possibly a result of interdialect borrowing) from /əw/ to /ow~u/ completed in the standard language by the thirteenth century. The Old Boral descends from synonymous Latin hebetō "I blunt", from adjective hebes "dull, blunt".

Jo so l'oc beint por my dolour youdar.

##

15.3: ustolment "manners"

ustolment /ˌi.stɔlˈmɛnt/ [ˌi.stʊwˈmɛnt]
- manners, etiquette, decorum, courtesy, the appropriate behaviour required by a particular social context;
- refinement, sophistication, elegance, stylishness, the quality of having cultivated a high-class affect

Etymology: Middle Boral nominal derivation from verb ustoldr "to behave well, to act properly" which continues Old Boral ustolre /ysˈtol.rə/, itself a univerbation of us tolre "to uphold customs, to act honourably", both parts of which are obsolete in the modern language.

The noun us "customs, mores, traditions" descends from Latin ūsus "use, practice, custom" (compare modern usar "to use up, wear out"), while the verb toldr "to lift up, give out, pass time" is from Latin tollō "I raise, remove".

Deut es ustolment por y femn voluð.

ouveg /uˈvij/ [ʊˈvɪj]
- sullen, sulky, having a brooding temper and a tendency to anger;
- gloomy, dismal, melancholy, characterised by sadness or pessimism (either of a person or a setting)

Etymology: from a variety of Old Boral forms oȝbeu(ȝ), ovieȝ et al. "unfriendly, rude" (the variant form ogveu /ɔjˈvaw/ was formerly widespread in the southern dialects), which descends from Vulgar Latin oblaecus "hostile", a variant of Classical obliquus "sidelong, oblique, envious, hostile" (see also Lombard biego "sinister, ominous" from the same Vulgar source).

Lour y veðerrem es tal ouveg cos nuvr.

15.5: The Second Great Dying

compilation of all the information I have on the Second Great Dying.

The Second Great Dying was a pandemic of bubonic plague occurring across the Vetomund, which arrived in Europe in early 1519 and lasted for between five and seven years.

The first victim in Borland of the Second Great Dying was in Damvath during the so-called 'green snowfall' (a term referring to any snow that falls in spring) of 1519.

Vascony lost over a fifth of its population, and Borland (at the time ruled by Joseph III) lost over four hundred thousand people in the Second Great Dying. 

Individual fatalities attributed to the Second Great Dying include: the wife and brothers of the grandfather of Dane playwright Absolon Mortenszen; the two elder brothers of Adaillé, Duchess d'Avosche.

Coastal areas and polities with closer ties to naval trade were hit harder and more quickly by the plague. Burgundy and Bohemia are notable examples of states which (according to their own records, which cannot entirely be trusted) suffered fewer casualities than most, while Portingale and Provence were ravaged early and mercilessly.

There was (and still is) a common misconception that people blamed cats and dogs for spreading the plague; this idea is only attested in connection with the Second Great Dying several decades after the event. It perhaps originated with stories of the monastery at Bonn, which banished all animals from the grounds in 1512 after several deaths (probably in actuality due to luetic pox).

Population loss due to this plague is sometimes cited as contributing to the collapse of feudalism.

16.1: To Save a Life

excerpt from the 1951 lovetale To Save a Life, originally published in Zahid Russian in Boxa [Nova Sad, Serbia] by first-time author Jeico Rhovich.

“It’s such a chance,” Halina said. “A Promethean society on our doorstep! You can’t tell me not to be interested. It is absurd we shouldn’t speak to our neighbour because of what his brother did twenty years ago.”

"Par sy—" Vadim tis vars parol. "Sy fraðr devastau tout. Impossibr es tu vel ig pardonnar!"
“What his—” Vadim groped for words. “His brother ruined everything. You can’t possibly forgive that!”

"Sy fraðr sta i," dis Halina cos obstinaç. "Nos posseu y bel amigtað beudar vars Segr Connic—"
“That was his brother,” Halina said obstinately. “We could extend the hand of friendship to Sir Connick—”

16.2: lovastr "chatty"

lovastr /loˈvastr̩/ [lʊˈvas.tɐ]
- sociable, outgoing, extroverted, inclined to companionship with others;
- chatty, gossipy, prone to friendly informal conversation;
- nosy, prying, snoopy, offensively curious or inquisitive

Etymology: from Old Boral lo(ȝ)vaçtre "talkative, forthcoming" (also loȝvastre following the syncretism of Latinate adverbial ending -aciter with pejorative -aster), from Latin loquāciter "in a talkative manner". Deletion of yogh in the first syllable is seen also in sevir "to follow" < Vulgar Latin sequīre; the behaviour of medial -qu- is somewhat inconsistent and may by conditioned by the surrounding vowels. Development of the more negative senses of the word occurs in the early Modern Boral period.

Tan lovastr es ty sour por toð gent sauraun en oy.
/tan loˈvastr‿ɛz ti sur pɔr tɔθ ʒɛnt soˈron ɛn ɔj/

##

16.3: kenopleus "space travel"

kenopleus /ˌke.noˈplawz/
- voidsailing, space travel, voyage through space

Etymology: nineteenth-century derivation coined during the voidtale craze sparked by Durgh'nen Shorzen Shouer (Through a Black Mirror) in 1795, from Ancient Greek prefix κενο- "empty" and stem πλεῦσις "sailing". Since then, both components have been in somewhat productive use in the field (both real and fictional, the latter often inspiring terminology in the former); see for example kenomaturg "astronaut, lit. void-worker" attested from 1876 and augeopleus "space travel by means of a solar sail, lit. sunlight-sailing" from 1909.

16.4: jubon "doublet"

jubon /ʒiˈbɔn/
- doublet; close-fitting jacket without sleeves (especially in more recent use);
- wrapper, wrapping; the material in which something is wrapped to protect it from the elements

Etymology: from fifteenth century jubon "doublet", borrowed via Vascon from synonymoys Mostara (al)juba, itself adapted from Arabic جُبَّة "jubbah, long garment". Variously in and out of fashion across Europe and her diasporas since the Revitalist period; notably absent for almost a century from the advent of Straightforward Fashion during the Long Peace. Extension to other wrappings and packaging is seen from the eighteenth century.

Jo sente magn voluð ne jubon de cogr.

16.5: Adaillé Nassow & Absolon Mortenszen

compilation of my notes on Adaillé Nassow, Duchess d'Avosche and of playwright Absolon Mortenszen.

Adaillé Nassow (1524–1608) was duchess of Avosche, a duchy in southern Willemy, for much of the sixteenth century and the start of the seventeenth.

Adaillé was born to Roger d'Avosche and his wife Caroline in 1524, the third of eight children. Her two elder brothers died in infancy (at least one in the Second Great Dying), as well as her younger brother Peter, and her youngest sister Anne.

She was raised in early childhood by her nurse Elisa Arnoutszen, cousin (and, later, coauthor) of the renowned physician Laurz Arnoutszen. During this time Adaillé was noted for her inquisitive and intelligent nature.

She was infamous during her later life for her great influence in the court of David of France. Rumours that she was his mother circulated from before his accession until his death.

In 1589 her grandson and heir apparent Déricque caused a scandal by running away from court and very publicly announcing his intentions to flee to New Provence in the Novomund (which he subsequently did).

---

Absolon Mortenszen was a playwright and commentator in the Dane Concert of the sixteenth century. He lived in Alburg, Denmark in the year 1560.

His grandfather is thought to have lost his wife and at least two brothers in the Second Great Dying.

He married a woman named Clara at some point before 1560; they did not have any children.

He had a brother who married a woman named Beatrys.

Shortly before 1560 he wrote a play titled 'High Society', which was received so well that the royal family altered the route of their Grand Tour in order to visit Alburg and see a performance.

17.2: yettar "fling"

yettar /jɛˈtar/ [ʝɪˈtɑː]
- to cast, toss, fling, chuck, hurl, to throw imprecisely with force or violence;
- to scatter, disperse, strew, pelt, to distribute objects around by throwing them out in a haphazard manner

Etymology: From late Old Boral iatar, ietar, iotar "to throw, to bestow, to offer", of uncertain origin. Likely from Old English, either from ȝéatan "to grant, approve" or ȝéotan "to pour, shed", although the semantics are somewhat tenuous; possibly it was influenced in meaning by Old Boral jaire "to cast, throw" or related Old French jeter "to throw".

17.3: rascettongar "sparkle"

rascettongar /raˈxɛ.tɔnˈgar/ [ʀɐˈçɛ.tʊŋˈgɑː]
- sparkle, twinkle, scintillate, to shine as if throwing off sparks or to emit flashes of light;
- crackle, spark, to make a fizzing/popping sound as of a lively fire;
- engross, fascinate, captivate, spellbind, to evoke an intense interest or attraction in someone

Etymology: verbalisation of Middle Boral noun (ra)scetonc "spark, flash of light", [the initial ra- seems for a while to have been reanalysed as an intensive prefix] from Old English adjective ræscettung "sparkling, gleaming". The related verb ræscettan "crackle" reaches western dialects of Boral as scettar "[of metal] to glitter, to be valuable" (possibly influenced in meaning by scet "coin").

Jo cossir tell'yam rascettongandessem.

17.4: orbeutar "swindle"

orbeutar /ˌɔr.bawˈtar/ [ˌɔː.bɐwtɑː]
- cheat, swindle, defraud, con, to obtain money or other property from a person by means of deception;
- screw, undermine, hinder, to ruin someone's position in a game or other situation

Etymology: from Old Boral orbeutar "to sneak up on, surprise", formed by metathesis from synonymous Insular Latin *obrēptāre, a regularisation via conjugation shift from Classical obrēpere "to creep, swindle". In the sense "defraud", possibly a retention from the Classical word, although this meaning isn't attested in Boral until trial records of the seventeenth century.

17.5: Significant Figures

collected notes on the lives of various important characters that I've mentioned before (in suspiciously alphabetical order).

Princess Alexandra (fl. 1471, known also as Sandra) was the elder sister of King Ambrose III of Vascony. She is principally remembered for being the first Vetomundine royal to set foot in the Novomund.

The chemical sandrine [Vitamin C] is named for her, due to her voyage advancing the understanding of the counter-scurvic effect of sandrine-rich foods like citrus fruits.

Alexandra was married at least twice; her second marriage began (and had issue) during the Wars of Fealty but before her famed voyage.

---

David (fl. 1590) was king of France.

David was dogged by rumours that he was the son of Duchess Adaillé d'Avosche from before his accession to the throne until his death; her influence on his court was noted and derided by contemporary commentators.

Shortly after a scandal involving the Duchess in 1589, David gained more political independence and (inspired by parallel developments across Europe) began to institute centralisation policies in France, increasing his own power at the expense of his ducal and comital vassals.

---

Joseph III (d. 1534) was king of Borland, remembered for ruling the kingdom through the ravages of the Second Great Dying.

Joseph never succeeded in producing a natural-born heir, despite several recognised yet illegitimate children by his various mistresses. Thus, after his death in 1534, he was succeeded to the throne by Brandon II, his nephew.

---

Laurz Arnoutszen (fl. 1540) was a Danish physician whose work in sanitation shaped the course of European medical history, to such an extent that in the context of medicine one can speak of pre-Arnoutszen and post-Arnoutszen Europe (although this periodisation can go too far in neglecting others' advancements and successes prior to his work).

At some point after 1535 he collaborated with his cousin Elisa Arnoutszen. His son was also pivotal in the history of medicine, being partially responsible for the discovery of one-case life [single-celled organisms].

His great treatise on medical handiwork [surgery] and other practice included recommending the employment of distilled lembick [ethanol] as liquid diffruction [disinfectant].

excerpt from Conjugation, Operation e Diabolica in Musica: Y Commouð Deviant Primal (The Early Deviance Movement), a 1970 historical review written by Borlish popular historian Catrin Veçount.

Nell'oc capparol voum nos un survol accommettr dy ci autranç cas barðment compostion, cas frameð musical, cas apprestanç de melody e harmoin, cas con- e desjogntur deur y model preluïscent, e cas y detaxion de costum mondial con particulertað vecin.
In this chapter we shall undertake an overview of the changes in instrumentation, in musical structure, in melodic and harmonic structure, in con- and disjuncture from the earlier styles, and in the detaxion of global traditions with vicine particularities.

Reconnosc dant all'experiç de Monçating con y barð, commettreu nos parmy scaumel ag toriot.
In light of Monçating's facility with the instrument, let us begin in the pipe family with the torriot.

Before the nineteenth century, the (precursors to the) torriot and similar low-pitched pipe instruments generally had a range of less than two doublings and the lack of modern reedmaking techniques severely limited their volume.

It was only with the advent of pedal holes—adapted from mechanisms pioneered with the Madray peria nadaswarm some decades earlier—that torriot players could reach both its famed low notes (and finally be worthy of the name "little thunder") and the startingly clear alto range.

18.2: kigmau "lardons"

kigmau /kajˈmo/ [kɐjˈmo]
- lardons, diced meat and especially diced pork as used in salads, soups or pies

Etymology: early Modern Boral borrowing from Welsh kigmow /kɪɣmɔw/ "pork" (from Old Welsh cig moh /kig mɔχ/), literally "pig meat", with the particular meaning due to the characteristic savoury handheld pies of the Tallath of Devon.

"Inacavabr es soup a kigmau pascr con digntað, donc nel attendr," avars i, l'oc Laum forniscent de pudour dec i n'aye ja *stað* attenent.

"It's impossible to eat lardon soup with dignity, so please don't try," she remarked, which was embarrassing because Will hadn't *been* trying.

18.3: yevot "scope"

yevot /jeˈvɔt/ [ʝɪˈvɔt]
- range, spectrum, scope, gamut, the space of available or attanable positions or options;
- extent, size, field, the area over which something extends or the degree to which something is applicable or relevant

Etymology: from Middle Boral yevot (also yef) "measure, size, length", a nominal derivation from now-obsolete yevar "to measure, to come to", originally from Latin aequō "I equalise, compare".

Nos parsisceum sull'yevot d'œculux.
/nɔz ˌparziˈxawm ˌsɪ.ljeˈvɔt ˌde.kiˈlɪks/
[nʊz ˌpɑː.zɪˈçawm ˌsɪ.ljɪˈvɔt ˌde.kɪˈlɪks]

##

18.4: parsir "learn"

parsir /parˈsɪr/ [pɐːˈsɪː]
- to learn, be taught, to acquire or attempt to acquire knowledge or ability in some field;
- to study, revise, to view or review material in order to make sure one does not forget it;
- to practise, exercise, drill, to repeat an activity as a way of improving one's level of skill

Etymology: first attested in Middle Boral, variant of older parscir "to learn" presumably formed via dissimilation in forms such as jo parscisc "I learn". Either a contemporary derivation from scir "to know how to" (from synonymous Latin sciō and now obsolete) or a retention of Latin perscīscō "I learn thoroughly" with the usual reanalysis of -scō conjugation.

    Cal bourg parsisceu tu dessur?
    /kal burg ɛz ˌparzɪˈxaw ti deˈsɪr/

18.5: Significant Figures, cont.

further notes on two important characters from the annals of history.

Munir al-Hamdawi (b. 1429) was the ruler of Morrack during the latter half of the fifteenth century.

He had a long-standing rivalry with Ambrose III of Vascony, which grew from a childhood enmity to a bitter naval and martial feud.

His reign included the conquest of the southern parts of Portingale in 1457 N, which had previously enjoyed a level of autonomy under Vascon stewardship.

In 1463 Munir established the New World Company (شركة العالم الجديد) as a rival marine enterprise to Ambrose's New Navarre Enterprise; five years later the ship Orion (الجَبَار) of this company circumnavigated Africa.

---

Vigo the Magnificent (d. 761) was king of the Britons in Gaul (and later of Greater Devon) from 720 N until his death.

He ascended to the position upon the death of his mother Queen Maud of Angeus, who as a widow had unified the Kernish kingdoms. This was (in 720) shortly after the Catumagin Accords with the Kingdom of the Franks to the east, which ended hostilities and established an official border between the kingdoms.

King Vigo is remembered primarily for leading the reconquest of Devon, which had been de jure under Wessaxon authority since the final defeat of the West Albic Britons at Gaulford in 656 N (although the more remote parts of the peninsula are thought never to have entirely submitted).

The reconquest of Devon spanned over two decades of intermittent fightning with Wessex and concluded with the victory at Petherton in 749 N. With this victory Vigo was crowned rex Magnæ Dumnoniæ "King of Greater Devon", unifying Devon with Kernow.

He married Guinnumar, daughter to King David I of Wynneth, in ca. 725 N. This marriage is likely what allowed him to secure Welsh assistance with the invasion. With her he had at least three children, including his son Cadern the Doubter (who would become king upon Vigo's death in 761) and his daughter Iseld of Devon, who later became the first patron of the Brethin of Tremonnow.

His prominence in the genesis of the kingdom lead to many of his royal descendants taking his name, including Vigo IV (crowned 940), who conquered east to Angeus, and Vigo VII (fl. 1121).

19.1: The Borland-Willemy Telegraph

excerpt in translation from Joan Bensaíd's 1951 scholastic quire El Herramente de Communicazón (The Communication Toolset).

For example, the towns of Nausçod on Borland and Lagcóch (at this time officially Laicouche in French Guillenne), being only 21 stadion apart as the crow flies and the former lying atop a steep promontory, are often within clear view of each other. 

Pre y sar campaner, por un lettr accaçar des l'un vars l'autr vel cair covallar ag havan d'Ausbagn lor trasir ne ferscip, eint plausibr a Heller sur tarmagn e soulor eint veg ancour a Texel.
Before the steeplemesh, to send a letter from the one to the other would require riding to the port at Axbane and taking a ferry, likely to Heller on the mainland and then across again to Texel.

After the air-steeples connected the strait (the intermediate baskets only being necessary in conditions of weakened visibility; on clear days the sighting could be accomplished directly via a farseer) in the latter years of the 1830s, no such diversion was necessary...

19.2: farrago "hash"

farrago /ˌfa.raˈgo/ [ˌfa.ʀɐˈgo]
- hash, chopped food (usually meat and potatoes) mixed together;
- jumble, hodgepodge, miscellany, a collection of various things or people

Etymology: borrowed in the seventeenth century from Latin farrago "fodder for animals, mishmash", likely via somewhat-earlier use in Italian cuisine. Used metaphorically from the very beginning, retained from its use in the way in Latin.

J'ay un desc farrago nos cogt.
/ʒe ɪn dɛx ˌfa.raˈgo nɔz kɔjt/

19.3: illabond "collapsible"

illabond /ˌi.laˈbɔnd/ [ˌi.lɐˈbɔnd]
- collapsible, fold-away, telescoping, designed as to fold up into a more compact form;
- (music) accordion, concertina, squeezebox, a portable wind instrument consisting of a bellows and keys;
- spyglass, a small and portable refracting collapsible telescope;

Etymology: first attested in Boral in the early eighteenth century, borrowed from slightly-earlier Vascon or possibly Kentish forms which each come from Latin illābundus "disposed to collapse", a participial form of illābor "I flow into, I tumble to ruins, I penetrate". In the last sense, shortened from veðr illabond "collapsible lenses".

Jo traseu y cogn un rað illabond portant.
/ʒo traˈzaw i kɔjn ɪn raθ ˌi.laˈbɔnd pɔrˈtant/

##

19.4: xiphar "scimitar"

xiphar /ksiˈfar/ [ksɪˈfɑː]
- scimitar, falchion, sabre, single-edged sword with a somewhat-curved blade reminiscent of a scythe;
- sellsword, freelance, a mercenary of the medieval period and especially such a person from the Masreck [the Levant]
- henchman, lackey, loyal subordinate usually working for someone with criminal  or otherwise-ill intent

Etymology: via Italian from late medieval Greek ξιφάρα <xiphára> "longsword, scimitar", an augmentative of ξῐ́φος <xíphos> "sword". Used metonymically in the second sense since the early nineteenth century in selfconscious reference to a fictionalised medieval period.

Jo vos lau ag treu dy ci xiphar.

19.5: The Winter Feast

Revillon (Borlish Reveglon /ˌre.vijˈlɔn/) is the Borlish term for the eve (and often the entire day) before Christide. It refers also to the specific cultural practice on the island of the Winter Feast (y Fest Reveglon), a celebration held on Revillon in churches across the land to which everyone in attendance brings food.

The Borlish name Reveglon means "vigil", and is a Middle Boral borrowing from the synonymous French reveillon, itself originally from Latin evigilō "I wake up". Earlier names include jolveisre, taken from Old Norse jólveizla "Yule feast", and fleðoul (of unknown etymology), both of which referred specifically to the celebrations.

Evidence of similar winter solstice festivities involving communally-prepared feasts on Borland predates even the Roman invasion, making Revillon one of the longest continuously-practised folk traditions in Europe (bearing in mind that the practice has evolved considerably with time). Third-century Roman historian Ammian Marcellinus provides us with an early written mention of the Winter Feast, which appears (under its original name Flidōlus, which gave the aforementioned fleðoul) in one of his asides on the Northern Isles. Post-imperial sources in the first millennium almost exclusively criticise the tradition as pagan and unholy; however, by the twelfth century the practice is fully appropriated by the Church.

Queen Natalia II of Borland abdicated on Revillon of 1894 as part of the political upheaval surrounding Borland's entry into the Drengot Collusion.

Foods traditionally associated with the Revillon Feast include: 
- the tort dell'ivan /ˈtɔʀt ˌde.liˈvan/ ("child's pie", in reference to the Christ child), a savoury dish often of lamb. The practice of scoring a cross into the lid and hiding a small wooden object inside (traditionally also a cross) is a later innovation, but compare the similar galette des rois seen on the continent. This name for the dish is attested as early as the tenth century in Old Boral torte del ifan /tɔɾ.tə dɛl iˈfan/, although the modern recipe including lamb and potato is not seen in writing until the eighteenth century.
- jonnovar zucarrað /ˌʒɔ.noˈvaʀ ˌzi.kaˈʀɑθ/ "candied butterflies", a sugar-spiced cakebread particular to the island which ever since their earliest iterations have been generously spiced (usually with dalassine bark and zingerroot). At this time of year they are formed into butterfly shapes, popularly thought to represent the metamorphosis of a dead winter into the new life of spring.

excerpt in translation from 1994 work Albic Medicine in the Workshop Decades, Part V: Alchemic Detaxion, written by Dr Harold Westcamp with additions by his collaborator Marcathow Cox.

Wine and other fermented drinks had been noted as a preventative of infection since the medieval period, and the wider availability of distilled lembick in the sixteenth century allowed Arnoutszen to recommend it in his great treatise.

20.2: ja oc eus "just as well"

ja oc eus /ʒa ɔk awz/ [ˈʝa.ʊˈgawz]
- just as well, (it's) all for the best, it could have been worse, phrase expressing encouragement about one's apparently unfortunate circumstances

Etymology: like many such idioms beginning with 'ja...', attested from the late Middle Boral period in various iterations; the first known use in its modern form comes from playwright Joðeg Patrac's 1602 work Dardan e Saugflour (Burdock and Elderflower).

Literally meaning "still this would have gone", its components each descend comfortably from Latin: ja "still, ever" from adverb iam "already", oc "this" from synonymous hoc, and eus "would have gone" from third person singular pluperfect subjunctive form īsset of eō "I go" (with influence from the indicative īvit for the vowel). Conventionally the idiom is followed by neðan "lest, so that … not" when used to start a full sentence.

Ja oc eus neðan kiglau tu y vec!
/ʒa ɔk aws neˈðan kajˈlo ti i vɛk/
[ˌʝa.ʊˈgawz nɪˈðan kɐjˈlo ti i ˈvɛk]

##

20.3: y jainç tauger "the long game"

y jainç tauger /i ʒents toˈgɛr/ [ɪˈʝens tʊˈgɛː]
- the long game; long-term strategy or an entire endeavour undertaken with patience;
- the big picture; the bird's-eye view of a situation viewed objectively;
- seeing the forest for the trees; the clarity that comes with a less-invested perspective, not being blinkered by emotional involvement or petty distractions

Etymology: Literally meaning "the upstairs tactic", the phrase is attested from the late nineteenth century during the Good Game period whose politics were reflected in the popular literature.

The noun jainç "tactic, move (in a game), attempt" is an Old Boral nominalisation from verb jair "to cast, throw (as of a die)", from synonymous Latin iaciō (or perhaps directly from a Latin noun iaciēntia "an instance of casting". The adjective tauger "upstairs, (by extension) more general" is a Middle Boral adjectival derivation from noun taug /tog/ "floor, storey, level, layer", a borrowing via Barcelon from Arabic طَبَقَة <ṭabaqa> "layer, stratum".

Des sovaugr mesveu jo y jainç tauger.
/dɛz soˈvojr  mɛzˈvaw ʒo i ʒents togɛr/

##

20.4: doujug veunt "ecosystem"

doujug veunt /duˈʒaj vawnt/ [dʊˈʝaj vawnt]
- ecosystem, food web, a biological system composed of all the organisms interacting with each other in a particular physical environment;
- (by extension) any complex network of interdependent parts which is difficult to understand except by considering it as whole

Etymology: attested from the Long Peace in the late eighteenth century to translate Mashick zawalli ca'irát "web of living things", from the work of Iscoval or his contemporaries.

The noun doujug "spiderweb" descends from northern dialect phrase doun jug /dundʒəj/ "July's down feathers" (standard pluot jugler /pljɔt ʒajˈlɛr/); the noun doun "soft, immature feathers" is borrowed from synonymous Old Norse dúnn, while jug reflects Latin Iūlius "July".

L'eç mersc recievn un doujug veunt frail.

20.5: A University, and Twins

compilation of my notes on the New Vithor University and on the twins Jacomo and Chiarina Bruno.

The New Vithor University (Borlish Nou Universtað a Viðor) is a major academic institution located in the Borlish city of Vithor.

The Vithor New School had been founded by the fifteenth century; by the nineteenth century it was known under the name "New Vithor University". By 1844 N it included the Vithor Historical Institute (l'Edifiç Historic); said institute was eventually divided into the Faculty of Concurrence History and the Faculty of Domain History.

At some point the New Vithor Primers (Nou Premour a Viðor), producer of academical publications based in the school, was established; in 2007 it was producing the textbooks for the school's courses.

Alumni
- Lambort Darrian (fl. c17), philosopher of altruism and charity
- Michael Bervisson (17th June 1799–12th January 1849), political historian
- Darren Brodus (fl. 1828), mathematician and pioneer in sam theory
- Sconet Ydreç (fl. 2008), author and medievalist

Offered courses
- Chocolate and Rubber: Cappatia during the Twining Century (Scoclat e Coscou : Cappatia par y Kintanç Mondial); 1986
- Concurrence History of the 18th Century: Gold, Science, and Waging War (Histoir Concorrent, s18 : Aur, Theory, e l'Art de Var); 2007
- Concurrence History of the 16th Century: Death, Ships and the Movement of the Heavens (Histoir Concorrent, s16 : Mort, Vascel eð y Motion Celest); 2008
__

Jacomo Bruno (fl. 1821) was a minor landowner in Furlaine in the early nineteenth century. He was the twin brother of composer Chiarina Bruno, who is better-remembered.

Jacomo fought in the Second German War, and participated alongside Borlish troops in the shambolic 1821 Battle of Hulm. During this service he met future mathematician Darren Brodus, with whom he would strike a life-long epistolary friendship.
__

Chiarina Bruno (fl. 1824) was a librettist and composer active in the early nineteenth century, primarily in the aftermath of the Second German War. Her most enduring work is the opera Ale in Fiamme (Wings Afire), an adaptation of the story of Icarus.

Born at her father's estate in western Furlaine, she lived in Verona for most of her adult life. She had a twin brother Jacomo; they were noted for their remarkably similar appearance, even for twins.

21.1: The Midnight Impostor

Sou y lumner dell'aubon joun, y citað de Bilvau lougeu com gem.

21.2: uvrautr "fertile"

uvrautr /iˈvro.tr̩/ [ɪˈvʀotɐ]
- fertile, fruitful, fecund, bearing a bounteous harvest or by extension producing anything in abundance;
- verdant, lush, characterised by the presence of a profusion of vegetation;
- idyllic, bucolic, pastoral, reminiscent of an idealised version of the countryside

Etymology: from Old Boral uvrautre /yˈvraw.təɾ/ "(of land) fertile", extended variant of synonymous uvre via suffixing -autre, an adjectival ending of dubious origin (often simply presented as reflecting Latin adverbial ending -āliter, but this presents issues). The earlier uvre descends directly from Latin ūber "productive, full, rich" and is still in agricultural use in some modern rural dialects.

Jamay n'ayen il un bourg uvrauterrem vis.
/ʒaˈme nɛˈjɛn ɪl ɪn burg ˌi.vroˈtɛrm̩ vɪz/

adj.
- awake, up, not sleeping and conscious of the world;
- alert, vigilant, capable of reacting quickly to new information and especialy to danger;
adv.
- vertically, upwards, downwards, following a trajectory that is roughly straight up or down

Etymology: from Old Boral yert(e) "standing, upright" (cf. Mostara yerto "stiff, rigid" or Lombard erto "steep"), a regular descendant of Vulgar Latin ērctus "upright, alert". This is a variant of synonymous ērēctus, the past participle of ērigō "I raise, build, erect".

quomodolibet /ˌkwo.moˌdo.liˈbɛt/ [ˌk(w)o.mʊˌdo.lɪˈbɛt]
- libertine, roué, rake, one free of social convention who acts however they please (particularly with respect to romantic or sexual norms);
- highflyer, maven, a person of great ability and ambition

Etymology: nineteenth-century coinage borrowed from Latin correlative quōmodolibet "howsoever, in whichever way". Originally used in a derogatory manner, more positive use begins to appear in the twentieth century.

21.5: Kent

collected notes on the polity of Kent.

Kent (formally the Bond of Kent and Normandy; in Rone French The Bond de Caint od Normandy) was a state in southern Albion and northern Gaul.

Pre-Conjuring Kent
In the first millennium, Kent was first an independent English kingdom and then a vassal of Wessex through its ascension and decline, gaining power and some autonomy as Wessern might diminished. Similarly-positioned Essex had a long enmity with Kent, with King Athelwolf of Essex mounting the most successful attempted conquest in the tenth century.

In the tenth century, King Jothey of Borland arrived in Kent with his queen and children, twice-exiled from Borland and Sothbar following the Dane invasions of the island.

Pre-Conjuring Normandy
Normandy was formed from Dane settlements in the north of Gaul in the ninth and tenth centuries. By the eleventh it had been established as a vassal of the Kingdom of the Franks as the Duchy of Normandy, ruled by the Drengot family. It stretched from the Vire river in the west to Flanders in the east, and Norman in-migration southward to found towns such as Thelmass continued for some centuries.

As the Dane Supremacy in the north waned in the tenth century, many left Sodrick and other Danish lands to the relative prosperity of Normandy. Moreover, Norman ships participated in raids along the coasts of Europe through this period, as far afield as Marsella in 946 N.

The Kernovan Conjuring and Afterwards
The political union of English Kent with Normandy began in 1029 N with the Norman-led subjugation of the Petty Kingdom of Kent as the first step in the creation of the First Drengotian Empire (also called the Constant Empire). This invasion was triggered by the death of the elderly patriarch Rodulf of Kent, who had ruled since childhood for nearly eight decades.

During the Wars of Fealty in the late fifteenth century, Kent was ruled by the Two Henries, the twin first-born sons of Vincent II. Kent came to a rapprochement with France to its south in the 1590s, just as the wars were becoming increasingly tangled and expensive.

Alongside the cities of London and Paris, Kent was the political centre of the Drengot Collusion of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with many governmental buildings located in Rone. Among these was the Red House, the popular name for the Kentish Ministry for Information. The activities of the Red House precipitated the Furore of 1961, which in turn led to the collapse of leader Darchild's tinplate administration (via the Darchild memorandum) and with it the entire Drengot Collusion. The dissolution of the Collusion inspired the Kentish ostracon reforms, which were subsequently used as a model in several polities around the globe.

The state's professional lineball team won the global tournament only once, in 1965.

- Jockin Abiscander, deixist historian and author

22.1: The Mysarnos Codex

excerpt in translation from Theodora Riphæna's 1943 work The Mysarnos Problem: the Enigma of an Inconvenient Codex.

Cu sta y scrittour dy Codex Mysarnos n'aun gent jamay saut consecter, e l'oc livr nil declarar aïr l'argument soluð;
The author of the Mysarnos Codex has never been conclusively identified, and this book will not pretend to have done so;

22.2: quaðeglad "campus"

quaðeglad /ˌkwa.ðijˈlad/
- complex, campus, base, a collection of buildings with a common purpose such as a university or military base;
- plant, works, estate, a collection of industrial warehouses or similar buildings in one area

Etymology: early modern-era borrowing from Welsh qυaðellad /kvaˈðiʎad/ "university campus, military base", a Middle Welsh compound of qυ-/kyv- "with, together" and aðellad "building, edifice, structure". This in turn is a noun derivation from aðello "to build, construct", from ello "to create, make, compose, put together".

Nos raðaum tras quaðeglad lonc camin attriboit.

22.3: soumonir "reference"

soumonir /ˌsu.moˈnɪr/ [ˌsu.mʊˈnɪː]
- to prompt, remind, cue, to bring something to the notice or consideration of someone;
- to reference, cite, mention, to quote a source or bring up a person or topic

Etymology: from Old Boral somondr "to summon, call", respelt in the Middle Boral period to better reflect its etymon in Latin summoneō "I advise, give a hint" and the related ammonir "to warn, augur, presage". Compare French semondre "to invite, convene", from the same source.

22.4: hey "fence"

hey /hi/
- fence, a thin artificial barrier that separates two pieces of land often used to keep animals to one area;
- barrier, obstacle, hurdle, something that is in one's way or otherwise preventing one from accomplishing what one wants

also hey pondr /hi ˈpɔn.dr̩/
- to separate, cordon off, to divide a portion from the rest and prevent it from intermixing

Etymology: noun from Old Boral hei, hey /hej/ "hedge, fence" (the extended senses are in use by the Middle Boral period), which is a borrowing from synonymous Old English heȝe—possibly influenced by Medieval Latin haga "hedge" which comes via Frankish.

Il ern y hey pegntant a roug.

22.5: The Long Peace

In historiography, the Long Peace refers to the decades surrounding the turn of the nineteenth century. Characterised by an absence of prolonged international conflict, the period extends from 1770 until 1815; from the end of the First German War to the outbreak of the Second German War.

The Long Peace precedes the period of Reaction War, an umbrella term including the Second German War and other contemporaneous conflicts around the world.

Contemporaneous periods include:
- the Decadence of Belgrade, denoting the waning power of the Kingdom of the Danube;
- the Mendevan Unmooring, which refers to the greater political and economic independence enjoyed by the Vetomundine settlements in Mendeva at this time;
- the Romantic Revival, an artistic and political movement characterised by optimism and heroism, especially with its focus on recapturing the 'brighter past' of the seventeenth century.

The kingdom of Saxony reached its territorial peak in this period, having conquered significant territory in the First German War.

The kingdom of Vascony at this time was the heart of the Modest Arrangement, especially in the Long Peace's later years under the Vallabrì administration and King Hernand.

There were major advancements in life theory in this period, including the discovery that the case kernel (also called the nux) housed Desselut's vital language. This was achieved by theorist Manesh Camdar in 1813 via research on marine sponge fecundation, in which he observed that the kernel of sperm unites with that of the egg.

In parallel were alchemical discoveries, including many new elements. For example, janthine was discovered in Zampanagar in 1778, and machovin in Poland a decade later.

The Long Peace saw the inception of the Deviance Movement (also called Anti-Paradise Theology), including the incendiary 1799 publication Et Nous Amerons les Fux (And We Will Love the Fire).

The armourcloth fashion (of women's evening dress decorated in the style of military uniform) has its beginnings early in this period, and is still most strongly associated with it, despite several revivals. The advent of Straightforward Fashion occurs somewhat later, beginning in the first decade of the nineteenth century.

23.1: The Girdled World

excerpt in translation from Milda'h Ragner's 1954 popular history Grex Byd: Kyvarvod y Vaωr Morωn (A Girdled World: The Great Borunesk Meeting)

In fact, more than a dozen crewmembers of mac Kellot's Phœbos had at least some Arabic; the British and Morrack mercantile domains had overlapped in Gaul and Spain for nearly two centuries at this point.

23.2: augrimar "to calculate"

augrimar /ˌo.griˈmar/ [ˌo.gʀɪˈmɑː]
- to calculate, compute, reckon, to determine an unknown quantity by mathematical means;
- (by extension) to perform algebraic manipulations on a mathematical expression;
- to reckon, suppose, guess, to deduce or conclude by the weighing of possibilities

Etymology: fifteenth-century verbal derivation from earlier augrim /oˈgrɪm/ "calculation, computation, arithmetic", which originally meant in particular "calculation using Arabic numerals". This comes from synonymous early Kentish or Norman augri(s)me, from Medieval Latin algorismus; this is taken from the name of the Persian mathematician al-Khawarismi, whose works introduced the positional number system to Europe.

23.3: annexar "supplement"

annexar /ˌa.nɛkˈsar/ [ˌa.nɪgˈzɑː]
- to supplement, append, augment, to add something extra in order to improve something or make it bigger;
- to boost, bolster, strengthen, to help something to increase or improve;
- to enhance, refine, cultivate, to permit or cause something to grow and develop

Etymology: first used in Borlish in the post-Revitalist era, a borrowing from Scholastic Latin annexō "I adjoin, attach". This is a verbal derivation from Classical annexus "tied, fastened, attached", past participle of annectō "I bind, connect".

Nos annexaum y parform con funambr follour.
/no‿ˌza.nɛkˈsom i parˈfɔrm kɔn fiˈnam.br̩ foˈlur/

23.4: roglfiar "to rust"

roglfiar /rɔjlˈfjar/ [ˌʀɔ.jʊˈfjɑː]
- to rust, oxidise, to combine slowly with oxygen to form an oxide as a natural process;
- to corrode, wear away, to diminish by gradually destroying small parts of as by the action of an acid;
- to lose familiarity with a subject by gradually forgetting information or losing muscle memory;
- (of hair) to lighten, to turn more blonde after prolonged exposure to sunlight especially during summer

Etymology: an Old Boral verbal derivation from roȝl /roʎ/ "rust, mildew" (modern rogl "rust") via the factitive ending -fi(ȝ)ar, which comes from Latin -ficō as an inherited descendant. The noun roȝl reflects Vulgar Latin robicula, a diminutive of Classical rōbīgō "rust", which is related to rōbus, rūfus "red".

23.5: The Brethin Order

The Brethin were a Christian religious order devoted to record-keeping and the maintenance of history. They had societies worldwide and a history dating back to the early medieval period.

The Brethin take their name from the distinctive heavy cloak (in Old Welsh, the bretin) worn by all members.

The order was founded in eighth-century Tremonnow—at that time a border town of the new Kingdom of Greater Dumnonia—under the patronage of Iseld, daughter of Vigo the Magnificent. Their original mandate was to preserve in particular the history of the Christianisation of Albion and Ireland, but the scope of their work quickly expanded to include secular history.

Brethin houses spread rapidly throughout the Briton states, and in later centuries they made inroads into France, Burgundy and as far afield as Andalus (although they would not gain a foothold in Italy until after the Great Fracture of the sixteenth century)

Not long after its inception, Brethin houses included both monasteries and convents, although in some regions institutions for one sex or the other predominated.

Of particular note are the Brethin of Kernow; they became the most influential school within the order during the late medieval period, with a substantial increase in membership through the twelfth century. At this time many courts of Europe employed monks of the Brethin of Kernow as advisors.

After the medieval period and until the modern day, the Brethin ran several major printing operations, such as the Yievle Brethin Primers, and educational institutions, such as the Tremonnow Open School (formerly the Brethin Mesh Institute).

Notable members
Pope Damian VI (the Wise), reigned 1199-1208 N

24.1: Classical Borland

extract in translation from late classical historian Robiaut Scarvon's 1952 textbook The Boral Province in the century after Hadrian (Y Provinç Boral par Siecr posc Hadrian).

Much as the Romans did across the rest of the empire, the pre-existing sacred practices and divinities on Borland were interpreted through the lens of and recast in the mould of the Roman pantheon.

This could be based on really quite tenuous analogies—for example, the old worship of Nahalennia along the southern and western coasts of the island, who was a goddess of trade and the ocean, was absorbed for unclear reasons into the cult of Pluto and she was syncretised with his wife Proserpina.

Just as there was Tamesis in Britannia and Sequana in Gaul, the river now called Reim was once personified as the god Reagimos.

24.2: sagntroðes "priestess"

sagntroðes /ˌsɛjn.troˈðɛz/ [ˌsɛjn.tʀʊˈðɛz]
- priestess, female cleric, a woman with religious duties and responsibilities and in particular a woman leading a religious service or similar rite;
- (obsolete) the wife of a priest or cleric

Etymology: feminine equivalent of sagntrouð "priest, cleric" attested in the second sense above since the medieval period. The word descends from Old Boral saȝrdouð, saȝ(n)drouð in the same sense; the unetymological -nt- was presumably inserted by analogy with adjective saȝnt < Latin sanctus "sacred, holy". The Old Boral reflects Latin sacerdōs "priest", related to sacer "hallowed, divine".

24.3: gaddar "screw"

gaddar /gaˈdar/ [gɐˈdɑː]
- to screw, to connect or assemble pieces of a construction using a screw;
- to hang on to, to grasp a surface tightly so as not to be pulled off;
- to propel oneself through water or air by the action of a screw propeller

Etymology: verbal derivation from obsolete gad (modern Boral gaddet "screw"), descending from Old Boral gad(d) "rivet, bolt". This in turn is a medieval borrowing from Old English gád "metal point, spearhead" or Old Norse gaddr "spike".

Nos erau y Nil gaddant aval n'auror.

24.4: quariçtovar "sabotage"

quariçtovar /kwaˌrɪts.toˈvar/ [kwɐˌʀɪs.tʊˈvɑː]
- to sabotage, to deliberately damage or destroy something in order to prevent its successful operation;
- to subvert, counteract, undermine, to oppose and mitigate the effects of something by taking action to the contrary

Etymology: nineteenth-century borrowing from Italian, either via the noun quarizzitovo or directly as the verb quarizzitovare (more likely; the stress of Boral quariçtou "sabotage, disruption" suggests it is an in-language deverbal derivation). This comes from Zahid Russian quaritstvo "intentional damage" via its use in military contexts during the Second German War.

24.5: Elsebeth Sneider

collected notes on the life and works of Elsebeth Sneider, author and social campaigner.

Elsebeth Sneider (m. 1772, d. c1830, née Siegert) was an author from Saxony and a pioneer of parachthon romance in general and voidtale in particular. Her most successful work was 1795 trevold Durgh'nen Shorzen Shower (Through a Black Mirror), which sparked the decades-long voidtale craze.

The voidtale craze sparked by this book lasted from the turn of the century until the Second German War, at which point its optimistic and exploratory character dropped rather rapidly out of fashion. Sneider's writings usually featured a heap of different xenic worlds and varied peoples, and the long voyages her characters took to explore them.

In 1772 she married Otto Sneider, scholar at the Stercundhaus in Lepzi.

In her later years she campaigned for reform to Saxony's inheritance law, especially with respect to eldest daughters with no brothers; though her more ambitious goals were ultimately unsuccesful within her lifetime, the political society she founded would go on to spearhead suffrage movements in Saxony, Denmark, and across the Latin republics. 

She also wrote against the nascent Deviance movement, despite her works' popularity with its adherents; in an 1821 letter to her sister she wrote:
    “It is not only their strange ideas and lonely, nihilist universe, dear Thifäne, but that so many of their number have approached me as if I were their most natural ally!”
The fervency of her opinion was visible in her later works, which have a decidedly theological bent.

25.2: scon stemn "second (cousin)"

scon stemn /xɔn ˈste.mn̩/ [xɔnˈstɛ.mɐn]
- (in the phrase cosvour scon stemn) second cousin, familial relation of sharing a single pair of great-parents;
- unprototypical, non-central, being only technically a member of some reference class

Etymology: literally "second lineage"; the adjective scon derives directly from Latin secundus "second" with some irregular reduction (to wit, sporadic loss of the pretonic vowel), while the noun stemn reflects Old Boral stemn "(plant) stem, sapling", from the synonymous Old English stemn. In metaphorical usage, seen from the sixteenth century.

Jo save noc tu aus cosvour scon stemn n'Ambrosia!

25.3: querellabr "controversial"

querellabr /ˌkwe.rɛˈla.br̩/ [ˌkwe.ʀɪˈla.bɐ]
- controversial, contentious, characterised by or liable to cause argument;
- disputed, arguable, open to debate with respect to validity or genuineness

Etymology: potential adjectival derivation from verb querellar "to argue, debate, quarrel", itself derived from noun querel "dispute, argument, quarrel". This descends from Old Boral, borrowed from synonymous Old French querele, which reflects Latin querēla "complaint, grievance".

Querellabr es ou l'ig imascry fos vray meðes volað.

25.4: cossy sceint "as such"

cossy sceint /koˈsi xint/ [kʊˈsi çint]
- as such, in that capacity, according to the role or manner of the aforementioned;
- therefore, consequently, following from the aforementioned as a result or consequence

Etymology: literally "there being thus"; the adverb cossy "thus, in that way" comes from Old Boral cossi, traditionally identified with Italian cosí as deriving from Vulgar Latin eccum sīc "this thus" but in fact likely from *causa sīc "the thing thus".

The word sceint is the present participle of sceir "for there to be", used in existential constructions. This verb descends from early Old Boral sier "to stay, be be present" (among other attested forms), from Latin sedeō "I sit, stay".

Y scavour cossy sceint poð noc hand dar all'hom poið.

25.5: Borlish borrowings into English

excerpt from Daughters of the Sea: The Northwestern Isles, a historical account of Ireland, Albion and Borland and the bonds of migration, technological transmission and shared cultural heritage over time. The book was written in 1956 by Merch author Challow Huddresfell during his time at the University of Safford's Faculty of Trade.

…a lodrigneth indreck hosting a stethley in the keething-ground davarn.

Our neighbours to the east have never matched the globe-spanning workshop and household vanguard of the British. Nonetheless, if only by virtue of proximity, the English languages have been adapted Borlish terms even from the medieval period. For example, while we associate the early centuries of the post-Roman Isles with migration from Albion into Borland (in particular, after the Merch subjugation of East Anglia in the late eighth century), words like danny "a nuisance, an irritating person", bather "stringed musical intrument" and parren "traveller, newcomer, novice" enter Old English from Old Borlish in the tenth century alone (according to their first attestations in monastic chronicles).

Later, in the post-Tetrarchic fractured landscape of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, Borland's advantageous position in the European trade mesh gave it the opportunity to introduce words for several goods into the English languages. In addition to the obvious examples of nargel and mauser fruit [coconuts and bananas], this period also gives us jackdaw glass and zackit masonry.

We also owe the word kevler, that staple genre of every top-line performer's more obscure contributions to film, to Borlish. Kevler romance arose in the Good Game period in the late nineteenth century as a subgenre of masquira tales (Carvallo's books themselves feature many elaborate robberies of diamonds and other traditional kevler prizes). Works in the genre have focused since its inception on thieving heroes entering high society as outsiders in connit [disguise] to make away with the hoarded treasures of the intolerably wealthy. It would perhaps be overeager to attribute romanç kevlar's many sensation works in contemporary Borland to a generalised class-levelling instinct (despite the scandals dogging the royal…

- to clear out undergrowth from an area;
- to lay the groundwork, set the stage, to clear the ground for an undertaking

Etymology: a Middle Boral period derivation from briscel "shrub, bush", literally "cause to be rid of low-growing plants". This noun from earlier arbriscel, diminutive of arbr "tree". In extended use the verb is seen from the eighteenth century.

26.3: madarc "beat cop"

madarc /maˈdaʀk/ [mɐˈdɑːk]
- lawman, beat cop, police officer and especially one on patrol;
- (dated, Axbane and environs) truncheon, cudgel, a short heavy club used as a weapon

Etymology: in its current sense formed in the early twentieth century by metonymy from its original meaning, from the prevalent use of such clubs by city constabularies. Meaning "club" it is much older; a Middle Boral borrowing from Arabic مَطَارِق‎ (maṭāriq) "hammer, fighting club", plural noun from the verb stem meaning "to knock, to hammer".

Etymology: originally, along with the corresponding deverbal noun coutoc "tap, poke, prod", in eighteenth-century staddenzen Boral as a borrowing from Yengatow [Tupi] cutuc "to pierce, stab" (likely altered by analogy to toccar "to touch, make contact with").

26.5: Borland

Borland (in Borlish Istr Boral /ˈɪs.tʀ̩ boˈʀaɫ/) is the easternmost of the three major landmasses in the Northwestern Isles, and also the name of the singular polity located thereon. The capital of Borland is Damvath, a port city on the east coast of the island.
Etymology

The name 'Borland' descends via from Old English Boralland, Borala land 'land of the Borlish people', where the first element is taken from Latin Borālī 'Borlish people'.

The origin of the Latin demonym is disputed. It is unknown whether the Romans knew the land as īnsula boreālis island in the north' before they settled Borland, or whether they borrowed the native Kelt name enis borag 'island of the dawn' (from its easterly position with respect to Albion and Ireland).
History

Borland Kelts

The Kelt population of Borland (self-described as the Bora Ale) is poorly documented. The few attestations of their language suggest only a recent divergence from the Briton tongue; they are thought to have arrived on the island from Albion, not directly from the continent.

This culture was connected to the European trade mesh via the export of tin and iron. Imported pottery of this period from finds across the island has been found from as far afield as Egypt and Persia.

The Kelts were organised into many tribes each covering small regions and ruled from hill fort structures. Several important religious sites of this time have been unearthed; most famously the Çadrosc labyrinth, which has sparked much unfounded theorising as to its origin and purpose.

Roman Borland

Borland developed diplomatic and trade links with Rome from the time of Julius Caesar and his expeditions to Britannia in 55 aN. The Roman conquest of Borland took place through the second half of the first century (especially during the Flavian period), building on their successes in Britannia.

Confederations of Kelt tribes resisted Roman occupation, especially in the north; several uprisings appear to have been explicitly imitating the successes of Buthick of the Iceni in Britannia.

In the second century, Emperor Hadrian adopted different strategies in Britain and Borland, characterised in Bervisson's 'An Eternal Rome: Ships of Theseus' as 'The Wall and the Hedgerow'. Possibly due to the lack of an analogous frontier to the Pictish lands, these policies are said to have led to significantly more autonomy in Borland, and in particular greater reliance on locally-born legions. There is evidence in writing of a sense of Borlish identity forming alongside the universal Roman citizenship.

It was also under Hadrian that Borland was made a separate province from Britannia; after the Diocletian reforms this became the Diocese of Boral.

Religion in Roman Borland

Just as the Romans did across the rest of the empire, the pre-existing sacred practices and divinities on Borland were interpreted through the lens of and recast in the mould of the Roman pantheon. This could be based on really quite tenuous analogies—for example, goddess of trade and the ocean Nahalennia was absorbed into the cult of Pluto, and she was syncretised with his wife Proserpina. Other deities were more localised, like Reagimos, a river god whose name lives on in the river Reim.

The fourth century saw the arrival of Roman Christianity on Borland, leading to the destruction or repurposing of many pagan site, both those originally from the Borland Kelts and shrines built by the Romans themselves.

Sub-Roman Borland

There is evidence of considerable Roman emigration from Borland to the continent during the late fourth and early fifth centuries, primarily from the cities of the west and south such as Aquae Balneī and Pons Seianus. The urban east was less immediately affected, and even received some Roman immigration from Britannia.

At this time, German peoples (primarily Angles) came from the mainland and settled in Borland, while they and the Saxons also went further and settled much of further-collapsed Albion. By the end of the sixth century they had formed the Borlish petty kingdoms of Southbar and Angland, along with several minor outlying settlements.

Meanwhile, the political structure of self-described Roman Borland was changing rapidly. Without the external influence of Rome's authority, the decentralised network of towns in the east was unified under the rule of Prase Victor Rossetus as the 'Diocese of Boral'.

First Kingdom of Borland

By the late sixth century the Diocese of Boral had become a monarchy (described in retrospect as the First Kingdom of Borland), whose ruling dynasty claimed descent from Rossetus.

This period saw a continuous influx of Christians (both Kelt and Roman people displaced by the German migrations and, later, missionaries) to the island. Rome under Pope Mercury II took a particular strategic influence in Borland, viewing it as a vital Christian outpost from which they could send missionaries east and west to aid the conversion of Albion and the Danes. For this reason, Borland's early monastic culture had an outward focus, unlike the insular communities of Ireland. The oldest surviving church in Borland is located at the Golfhaun Sanctuary (Asȳlum Æstuāriī) which was consecrated at this time.

However, papal opinion of Borland was prone to change, and many saw it as a convenient place of unofficial exile for (politically or theologically) troublesome figures. Thus, any given Borland monastery might house semi-heretical monks 'entrusted with the conversion of the pagans', or else men with suspicious sympathies to one of the Grecian heresies (see in particular the role of Marmeronism).

The Tripartite Wars

The influx of English people into Borland continued throughout this period; for example, the Merch subjugation of East Anglia in the last decades of the eighth century sent many people east to the petty kingdoms of Angland and Southbar.

The question of fealty (that is, whether any kingdom of the island would received official recognition and deference from the others) vexed the island throughout this period, with conflicts leading to temporary alliances between Boral and Southbar or Boral and Angland depending on the political climate.

Finally, in the early ninth century, Roman king Stiglan married his son Marc to the only daughter of Alfegh of Angland, unifying their kingdoms and forcing Southbar to pledge fealty after the circa-810 N Battle of Fendal.

Dane-ruled Borland

Attacks on Borland towns and monasteries by Dane raiders along the coasts began in the late eighth century, spreading gradually westward as viking raids grew lengthier and more lucrative. Through the ninth century raiding is gradually upgraded to long-term settlement, especially in the northern half of the island. Eventually, Dane pretenders (coroncr) to the Borland throne arose and threatened to topple the kingdom.

After the fall of the First Kingdom in 898 (and the establishment of Dane Borland ruled from Damvath), the young King Jothey went into exile with his wife Queen Brenna of Barrow to Sothbar. There they remained at court for over twenty years, and had several children. Subsequently they were forced to flee again to Kent as Dane Borland conquered the remainder of the island, uniting it for the first time since the Roman Empire.

Medieval Imperia

In the context of the First Drengot Empire to the west and the German Empire to the south, independent Borland had significant strategic value both militarily and economically. This was especially true in the towns and cities along the south coast such as Axbane, which saw a great increase in harbour traffic during the eleventh and twelfth centuries.

This period also saw the arrival of the Jacobin Fraternity to the island. Forced to flee Flanders in 1067 after being implicated in a popular uprising against Emperor Nathaniel II, they built the Peninsular Monastery overlooking the city of Axbane.

Post-Tetrarchic Borland

With the collapse of the German Empire and growing sympathies towards the Augsburg See, Rome considered the Baptism of the North an urgent undertaking. The Rome-allied Duchy of Crain collaborated with Borlish missionary forces and the Convoy Australier to bring Christianity to Lithow and its more distant Graven neighbours.

The late thirteenth century sees the birth of a Borlish-language body of literature. Although we have earlier examples of treaties and religious texts in the vulgar tongue, works written in Borlish were hitherto sparse and either utilitarian or didactic.

In 1292 the chronicle 'The Life of Catrin of Kernow' (Y Við a Catrin de Cornou) was written, detailing her early life, marriage into Borlish noblility and eventual assassination in 1233. It is notable for being the first long-form work of Borlish literature written about a layperson, rather than a saint or similar legendary figure.

The 14th and 15th centuries

The Noccair Lyceum of the 1300s exemplifies how the mediaeval university system was standardising across Europe. There, students were taught the Five Romantic Arts: Literature, Argument, Reckoning, Geometry and Songcraft. These were in essence the descendants of the seven Classical arts. Around 1400, as this system began to break down, the Lyceum began to teach alchemy (and a little later, post-Classical history).

The end of the fourteenth century marks the zenith of Borlish trade power, with cities along the Rustigh Strait (especially Axbane) trafficked both by the Dutch stadbund's fleet and Borland's own. In this way Borland served as a crossroads between the Vascon trade mesh in the west and the stadbund's to the east. Later, in the 1400s, Borland lost ground to the ascendant Wales and Vascony, which began to monopolise trade coming from the Middlesea and Africa.

In the first decade of the fifteenth century, Queen Natalia I and her husband King Joseph I ruled jointly. Their family had been and would continue to be beset by misfortune; all three of their sons predeceased them, as did their few male grandchildren (either in infancy or by misadventure).

The succession crisis prompted by their deaths in 1411 and 1416 spelt the end of their dynasty. From the ashes rose the Saulestran lineage of kings, whose banner comprised a white bar cutting a twilight-blue field.

Borland was not directly involved in the Albion-wide Wars of Fealty, but it received an influx of immigration from the polities involved, as people were displaced in the many border conflicts and attempted conquests. In particular, this period saw substantial Welsh, Devoner and Kernish immigration to the cities of southern Borland.

Borland after the Novamundine Landfall

With the dawn of the sixteenth century and the waning power of Vascony, the dominance of Borlish cities over regional trade reached its peak. Damvath was said to be the most-trafficked port in Europe outside the Middlesea at this time.

The Second Great Dying reached Borland in March of 1519; likely due to the volume of trade there, the island's first recorded death attributable to the plague was in Damvath during the year's green snowfall. Borland lost over four hundred thousand people—one-seventh of its population—to the plague.

After the death of Joseph III in 1534 N, his nephew Brandon II succeeded to the throne (King Joseph never succeeded in producing a natural-born heir, despite several recognised yet illegitimate children by his various mistresses). Having known he would inherit, King Brandon had made sure to be well-liked at court; upon his accession he managed to impose a terrene tax on the land despite significant opposition from his most powerful vassals.

Borland became entangled in the War for the Stavang Crown in the 1550s, a protacted succession crisis for the Dane Concert following the death of the king while undertaking a grand tour of his lands.

The practice of serfdom (already on its last legs) was legally abolished in Borland in 1564, but by that point it had not de facto existed on the island for a generation. This is often cited as being due to the labour shortage resulting from the disruption of the Second Great Dying.

The 17th and 18th centuries

Borland's involvement in the Romantic Wars was restricted to a failed invasion (culminating in the Hawkirch Surrender of 1632), along with unstable arrangements with neighbouring polities regarding military aid in their conquests.

Through this period, Borlish trade guilds were involved in the establishment of staddomains along Atlantic Cappatia and Africa. Initially little more than tradingposts, these would grow into significant polities over the next centuries.

Agricultural innovations in Borland began to accelerate in the eighteenth century. The Pentrose survey of the 1730s was a coordinated effort to find the most productive or otherwise useful cultivars of many plants which spurred significant productivity increases. Its crowning glory was the braxoch beet, a hybrid of Silesian and Cassuvian beets whose sugar content was high enough to make domestic sugar production economical.

Borland in the Long Peace and afterward

The location of the Borlish parliament had until this point not been fixed to one building—usually one member would donate use of an estate for the duration of a legislative session. In the late eighteenth century this state of affairs ended, with the completion of the Jacobin Estates (Palaç Jagovin) in Damvath.

During the inflamed period of Reaction War which followed the Long Peace, Borland participated in the Second German War. Borlish soldiers were present at the disastrously mismanaged Battle of Hulm in 1821, and they fought alongside troops from many nearby countries, such as Furlaine and Crovatia. The war and Borland's alliance with the Northern Concert sparked major mozard protests in cities across the country.

Borland in the Workshop decades

The steeplepost arrived late to Borland, with most of the island's flag-lamp lines being erected in the 1810s and 1820s (somewhat accelerated by strategic military considerations). Axbane was later connected to the continent at Texel in Willemy via air-steeples, but by 1860 this had been replaced (along with much of the island's steeplemesh) by a barrick line.

The spelling reform of 1870 (the last major revision to Borlish spelling conventions) primarily acted to standardise—at the time, many words had multiple forms in use reflecting more or fewer of the sound changes of the last few centuries.

The Good Game period

The genre of masquira which originated in Spain flourished in Borland in the late nineteenth century. The particular popularity of kevler romance (romanç kevlar) on the island produced several sensation trevolds and lead to the term being borrowed into several other languages.

The 1890s saw Borland join the growing Drengot Collusion (several Borlish cities, although not the capital, had already joined as part of the New Urban Mesh); Queen Natalia II abdicated on Revillon of 1894 due to the political upheaval of this process.

Culture

The celebration of Revillon is an ancient tradition in Borland; some form of the practice dating back to the time of the Insular Kelts. As part of the festivities, people bring pastries and other baked goods to grand Revillon Feasts (Fest Reveglon) held in churches across the country.

In Borland, if in a given year there is snow in spring after the yearturning (i.e. on or after the 1st of March), the first such snow is called the 'green snowfall' (neyanç vert). Years which have a green snowfall are generally considered unlucky, as a symptom of a long and bitter preceding winter.

There are several Borlish folk songs of unknown origin, including the 'Season Song' (Cant a Saçon). This song, like many in its tradition, uses an idiosyncratic scale sometimes mistakenly conflated with the manoscard scale.

The figures of the graveyard fiddlers are a folk tradition peculiar to Borland. These spirits associated with death are said to be the source of a mysterious sound of string instruments heard especially in cemeteries.

A related group are the Wild Hunt (Cauç Ragnt), a party of hunters passing overhead said to be responsible for the sound of thunder and strong winds. A children's story common to many cultures across Europe, the Wild Hunt in Borland shows clear signs of a Dane origin—not least that it is traditionally led by Balegr, a kenning of Odin.
Language

By far the most commonly-spoken language in Borland is the Borlish language, the only surviving branch of Insular Romance. It share many features with Gallo-Romance, including loss of case and intervocalic lenition. It was also heavily influenced in the first millennium by Old English and Old Norse.

27.1: The Witch of Tebjacka

extract in translation from Mashick Arabic of 1823 short shory 'The Witch of Tebjacka', written by Tazim Gennun.

Cayen ciel de neir fosc encoster, aguilað par murðon stel lougent.
The sky was a deep, inky black, studded with a myriad glittering stars. 

Y lun oppos bagna l'œcumen sou un lumner argentastr, ombr jaint lonc tras y ci tombr dallottað.
The full moon bathed the landscape in a silvery light, casting long shadows across the rolling hills.

- wholeheartedly, sincerely, earnestly, without any reservations or other any other mitigating factors;
- full steam ahead, balls-out, recklessly, with great abandon heedless of any negative consequences

Etymology: appears in the seventeenth century in the standard language, taken from an earlier northern dialect idiom cur eð am "earnestly" (often written as one word). The phrase literally means "heart and soul"; the first noun may have been influenced in its vowel by medieval Borland English hierte /ˈhi͡yrte/ "heart", while the second descends directly from Latin anima (the modern language having reborrowed anim "soul").

    Toð my famigl promoun kireðam y regnanç anthracit.

27.4: niaç a fuyo aïr "live in sin"

niaç a fuyo aïr /njats a faˈjo ɛˈjɪr/ [nɪˈʝats a fɐˈʝo ɪˈʝɪː]
- to live in sin, to cohabit as if legally wed without being married;

Etymology: idiom first attested in the nineteenth century, especially in association with otherwise-deviant (or Deviant) behaviours such as blasphemy unpalatable to the mores of the Modest Arrangement. The phrase literally means "to have a robin's nest", presumably in reference to robin's nest-building behaviour (which occurs after they have formed monogamous couples for the mating season).

The noun niaç "nest" is an extension of Old Boral ni, which directly reflects synonymous Latin nīdus; fuyo "robin" is of uncertain origin, with theories ranging from a dialect pronunciation of figl "child" to a hypothetical Kelt etymon related to "sparrow".

Il aun niaç a fuyo pall'eç dou annað.
/ɪl on njats a faˈjo paˈlɛts du aˈnaθ/

27.5: New Provence

New Provence was a coastal polity in the east of Mendeva. It is named for Provence, a small Middlesea state whose trading ships first set up trading posts along the coast of Mendeva in the early sixteenth century.

The country bordered Ambrosia to the north, the states of Gulf Mendeva to the south, and it shares a short border with Hasiny to the southwest. It extends inland in places as far as the Sturgovan Mountains.

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the trading posts along the New Provincial coast dealt primarily with Mastoiset peoples, exchanging (for example) metal tools for beaver pelts.

Although by the 20th century the polity was politically independent from Provence, cultural ties remained strong, including shared newspapers and substantial movement of people in both directions. They also shared (until at least 1943) more restrictive morality laws than their neighbours, being the strongest remnants of the Modest Arrangement of the century prior and notable non-signatories of the 1850 Laic Declarations of Belgrade.

28.1: A Door, Once Opened

excerpt in translation from the first chapter of Clarissa Bellamy's 1920 work A Door, Once Opened; the translation into Borlish was done by her friend Gunna Despath.

"Ac vespr, bossir," saluðau y livrer, y test ponent nacleu d'un façon stant cortal e conjuraçonnant y dou—a veg meðes solemn demay por un vocationner ma parcevent cos manifest demay por un actour doit. "Jo crey noc nos ayau acconnosc. Jo dign Brandon Cavendish."
"Good evening, sir," the bookseller said, inclining his head in a way that was both courtly and conspiratorial—at once too formal for a tradesman and too obviously self-aware for a trained actor. "I don't believe we've met before. I'm Brandon Cavendish."

"Frederick Walton, thein vostr," respos Frederick, y man offriscent. Y pogn de Cavendish sta sec e freit, luy man soccoðent cos starc lon skassar.
"Frederick Walton, at your service," Frederick replied, extending his hand. Cavendish's grip was dry and cool, his handshake firm without being crushing.

"Soð vos ac por gilaçar, Sr Walton, ben n'un tom particuler tenent all'idea?"
"Are you here to browse, Mr Walton, or did you have a particular volume in mind?"

"Nien de tal apprestment," dis Frederick. "Jo so nuvr alandað des Goring e donc un novel misol a leir recarnt auvorn."
"Nothing so planned," Frederick said. "I am recently arrived from Goring and in dire need of some new reading material."

"Lor soð vos venuð ag bon varous," dis y livrer par un sourey plait. "Vel jo te mostrar ig noscon vençað."
"Then you've come to the right place," the bookseller said with a smile. "Let me show you what we have."

28.2: y parol robar "to choose one's words"

y parol robar /i paˈrɔl roˈbar/
- to phrase, to choose one's words in a particular way in order to achieve a desired effect;
- to dissemble, prevaricate, to disguise one's true intentions by employing specific phrasing

Etymology: idiom first attested in the fifteenth-century poetry of Manuel Kigman, literally meaning "to dress (up) one's words". The noun parol "word" descends directly from Vulgar Latin paraula "(the power of) speech, language", from parabola "comparison, parable"; the verb robar "to dress (someone)" is a derivation from rob "robe, dress, longcoat", which is a borrowing from Old French.

Dagormay erra i sy parol robar volonter.
/ˌda.gɔrˈme ɛˈra i si paˈrɔl roˈbar ˌvo.lɔnˈtɛr/
[ˌda.gʊːˈme ɪˈʀa i si pɐˈʀɔw ʀʊˈbɑː ˌvo.lʊnˈtɛː]

28.3: jamir "complain"

jamir /ʒaˈmɪr/ [ʝɐˈmɪː]
- (intransitive) to complain, grumble, lament, to express feelings of dissatisfaction or discontent;
- (transitive) to bemoan, lament, to express sorrow or discontent about something

Etymology: from Old Boral jamir "to bemoan, deplore", a northern dialect form descending from synonymous Insular Latin gemīscō (a variant of Classical ingemīscō). In intransitive use it is first seen in the Middle Boral period.

Jamiscað plu, casc hom!

##

28.4: neðolmar "comply"

neðolmar /ˌne.ðɔlˈmar/ [ˌne.ðʊwˈmɑː]
- to yield, give in, surrender, to give oneself up into the power of an enemy;
- to conform, comply, submit, to act in the prescribed manner;
- to belong, match, fit in, to be in the proper place as part of a group

Etymology: first in the military sense from Old Boral noun neðvolm "surrender, capitulation", presumably from a Borland Old English word *niþfolm with a similar sense and literally meaning "down hands", from the gesture of lowering one's hands in order to display submission.

Jo hoir nolir jamay lour neðolmar.
/ʒo hɔjr noˈlɪr ʒaˈme lur ˌne.ðɔlˈmar/

28.5: Saxony and Libya

Saxony is a polity in Europe bordering places such as Poland, Willemy and Bohemia.
History

During the Second Tetrarchy, the Kingdom of Saxony was a major vassal state of the German Empire administered from Bardwick, and many of their Hohenbrocken dynasty ruled the empire outright. The region in the twelfth century is characterised by tensions between Saxony and Bavarn, the other major vassal kingdom of the empire.

The Kingdom of Saxony was affected by the collapse of the Second Tetrarchy in the thirteenth century; the nascent Stadbund of mercantile cities in the north seceding and reducing Saxony to its lands upstream in Maidburg and Lepzi.

Saxony is considered to have profited most from the First German War; in its aftermath the polity controlled more territory than it had at any point in its history.

In the nineteenth century, the Blue Marian Society (which was founded in Lepzi) spearheaded movements for reform to inheritance and suffrage laws.

Libya is a Middlesea polity on the north coast of Africa, located between Morrack to the west and Egypt to the east.
History

During the Second Tetrarchy of the early second millennium, Libya (under the name Ifricia) was an important admiralty of the Single Caliphate, ruled from Tunis. As imperial hegemony in Europe and northern Africa began to fall apart, so did the Single Caliphate; an independent admiralty in Libya was declared in 1237 (at the same time as the Maghrebi admiralty to the west).

Although Libya's navy was not yet trading directly with the Novomund in the sixteenth century, seamen from the region were commonly employed in the merchant fleets of Morrack and (especially) of Provence.

In the early seventeenth century, the banner of Libya comprised two black fields, one white and one orange. At this time, the polity warred intermittently with Morrack over control of trade into the eastern Middlesea.

In the modern day, Libya is a significant refiner and exporter of cuproses.

29.2: treublar "annoy"

treublar /trawˈblar/ [tʀɐwˈblɑː]
- to trouble, annoy, distress, bother, to cause somebody to be anxious or perplexed;
- to hinder, fetter, hold back, to be an obstacle preventing someone from acting as they wish

Etymology: from Old Boral treular, triblar (among other forms) "to pressure, to stopper", which descend directly from Latin trībulō "I press, squeeze, extract". The survival of the form treublar in particular may be due to influence from unrelated contemporary English troublen or French troubler, which are related via metathesis to Vulgar Latin turbulō "I disrupt, perturb".

J'ay spien y heloit vos treubr noc.

29.3: vessonary "catalogue"

vessonary /ˌvɛ.so.naˈri/ [ˌvɛ.sʊ.nɐˈʀi]
- fashion plate, costumery, a collection of pictures illustrating the latest fashions in clothes;
- (more broadly) catalogue, a retailer's publication detailing their stock allowing readers to have items delivered;
- portfolio, an artist's compilation of example works used in applying to potential employers

Etymology: from the late eighteenth century, a derivation of vesson "outfit, costume". This descends from Old Boral vesçon "clothing, attire", from synonymous Insular Latin vestiō which is a Borland-specific derivative of vestis "garment, article of clothing". Extension to general collections of products is seen by the mid-twentieth century.

A tu uncos sou y blau trovað nell'ig vessonary?
/a ti ɪnˈkɔz su i blo troˈvaθ neˈlaj ˌvɛ.so.naˈri/

29.4: daugnam "prat"

daugnam /dogˈnam/
- prat, ninny, a silly or foolish person;
- dupe, patsy, a person who has been or is likely to be deceived by a con artist;
- (dated) tosser, jerk, an objectionable or obnoxious person

Etymology: borrowed in the late nineteenth century from Markland English daugnam /ˈdəwg.nəm/ "contemptible man, idiot"; the word's etymology often mistakenly linked to Sarzan Dawkinholm (whose surname was pronounced the same), long-serving and much-lambasted Outland Minister in Markland at the time.

In fact, the surname and the word both descend from variously-spelt epithets for illegimate offspring in the royal houses of medieval Albion. These are Anglicisations of the Norman daucun houme "from nobody"—compare modern Boral alcun hom /ˌa.gɪˈnɔm/ "nobody".

29.5: Morrack

Morrack is a polity primarily in northwestern Africa.

History
Morrack was a local trading power in the late medieval period, with a mercantile domain bringing them into irregular conflict with the overlapping meshes of Britain and Borland meshes to the north (and later that of Vascony during their ascendancy).

In 1457, Morrack (which at this time controlled also Andalus) subjugated the southern part of Portingale, which had previously enjoyed a level of autonomy under Vascon stewardship.

Morrack was one of the earliest Vetomundine powers to undertake extensive exploration of the Novomund. The prophetically-named New World Company was established by Malik Munir al-Hamdawi in 1463, and almost as soon as news of the Novomundine Landfall had reached court were ships of the Company sent westward. It was this fleet which made contact with the peoples of the Arcabil, as well as the Mashick and Tavancine empires.

Morracan ships were the first to circumnavigate the world, having reached the Great Borunesk Meeting of 1519 via Cappatia.

The death of Tavancine Emperor Cariwasari in 1660 is suspected to have been an assassination carried out on Morracan orders, purportedly to allow for more profitable trade in silver from Tavancy—Morrack was at the time running low on funds to support their ongoing wars in Vascony and Libya.

Morrack was embroiled in several conflicts through the mid-eighteenth century, particularly as part of the world-spanning Democratic Wars. An attempted war of reconquest against Andalus to the north was the most protracted of these, lasting de jure even into the years of the Long Peace.

The Good Game period of the late nineteenth century saw a brief fad for 'Morrack fashion' in countries across Europe and the Novomund, in areas such as dress, architecture and food. There was, for example, a trend for exposed stonework draped in tapestry and curtains in contemporary buildings.

In the early twentieth century, Morrack was still in the habit of banning books containing subversive politics (and, unofficially, certain personal immoralities), having inherited a somewhat-scrupulous climate from its participation in the Modest Arrangement of the previous century.

The Japetos III submarine link between Morrack and Ambrosia was completed in 1950, after delays due to budgetary concerns and the outbreak of war.

30.2: evier "sink"

evier /eˈvjɛr/ [ɪˈvjɛː]
- sink, basin, a receptacle for holding water used to wash things;
- (more generally) any low area into which water flows

Etymology: practically unchanged from Old Boral, a borrowing from Old French evier, ewer "pitcher, jug, basin" which reflects Latin aquārium "object related to water". Compare the native descendant augher "ewer, jug".

Jo me landau y visaç raut nell'evier.

- protect, keep safe, defend, to provent harm coming to;
- preserve, maintain, to keep from any sort of degradation including the effects of time;
- police, patrol, regulate, to control or direct according to a given set of laws or principles

Etymology: from Old Boral, a verb derivation from costosc "protection, defence" which descends uncomplicatedly from Latin custōdia "safekeeping, custody". This etymon also gives Boral costojan "police officer" and costojal "defensive", as well as Kentish costage "imprisonment, captivity".

Il n'aun recas ig tu lou costosc.

30.4: baury "panic"

baury /boˈri/ [bʊˈʀi]
- panic, frenzy, overwhelming fear or anxiety;
- despair, hopelessness, the utter loss of any hope that one's circumstances can improve

Etymology: from Old Boral bauri, baari et al. "panic, alarm", borrowed from the synonymous northern dialect word baar, baor with the addition of the redundant nominal suffix -ri (modern Boral -ary). This word, whence also baurous "desperate, frantic", is of obscure origin, but the traditional view is that it descends from Latin pavor "fright, anxiety".

30.5: Masquira Romance

Masquira romance is a genre of stories which typically feature criminal (or crime-fighting) characters, as well as plots driven by hidden identities, high society and complicated schemes. It overlaps with the slightly-later spycraft genre, especially in modern works which draw on both literary traditions.

The name 'masquira' derives from Ezio Carvallo's 1860 trevold Tejan de Masquira ou Jalico "In Either a Mask or a Suit", which is widely considered to have pioneered the genre.

The kevler romance is a subgenre of masquira focused on glamorous thefts and schemes, particularly popular in nineteenth-century Borland.

History
Although many of the tropes of the genre have been use in literature since time immemorial, we see the birth of a distinct genre of masquira romance in the late Workshop period, through the prolific work of Portingale author Ezio Carvallo. His dozen-strong series of trevolds, for example, almost single-handedly created the concept of a kevler story (although we can see a parallel trend in the older Cathayan tapsue "magpie" tales).

The popularity of masquira supplanted to some extent the dwindling voidtale fashion in Europe, as well as various herdtale traditions across the Novomund.

In the 1940s and 50s there was a resurgence in popularity for masquira romance, christened the 'Spring Tide'; this period saw many film adaptations the genre's classics and thus cemented its place in modern popular culture.

Social Detaxion
The narrative focus in masquira romance on characters with hidden identities has led several marginal groups to embrace masquira tales over the decades. Perhaps most notably, the genre was very popular early on with the semi-public tovarick communities in the Riverine Cities. These communities spread the influence of masquira through Europe and the Novomund, particularly along with the broader Deviance movement.

Indeed, the tovarism connection was barely obfuscated in some works (see particularly Takach's We Will Burn Together), and the popularity of the genre is widely understood to have contributed to the Household Renovation.

The popularity of the subgenre of kevler romance in Borland during the Good Game period has attracted much commentary. In the context of a scandal-ridden royal family and a generalised class-levelling instinct pervading the politics of contemporary Borland, it is perhaps unsurprising that "stories of heroes entering high society as outsiders in connit in order to make away with the hoarded treasures of the intolerably wealthy" struck a particularly harmonious chord.

Notable works

Apollo on Holiday (Apollon Cogmaðer), 2009 story written by Endric Kirennaga
In Either a Mask or a Suit (Tejan de Masquira ou Jalico), 1860 trevold by Ezio Carvallo which named and pioneered the genre

31.1: 2-D Geometry

    excerpt in translation from the correspondence of Dewock Barclythe (1452-1539 N),Friar of Tremonnow; these lines are from a missive sent to his acquaintance Lluprando da Treviso at the University of Saint Marinus.

Quemant es locutionnar ig cas y plan d'Euclid, dou form mozað calscon son tojorn parallel, oc a digr il hamtn un plan parey.
It is good to remark that in the context of Euclid’s plane, all mozate forms are parallel, which is to say that they are coplanar.

This observation has led our Jarleth to conjecture that mozate forms might possess themselves a sort of direction, in the same way that a line segment may be endowed with one of two directions.

The most natural sense of direction a form like a circle or square might possess is undoubtedly the sense of a sundial.

31.2: vellisquar “scheme”

vellisquar /ˌvɛ.lɪsˈkwar/ [ˌvɛ.lɪˈskwɑː]
- to strategise, plan ahead, scheme, to formulate a strategy for action;
- to cheese, finesse, to use a cunning or unsporting tactic to gain an advantage in a game or to evade a problematic situation

also vellisqment /ˌvɛ.lɪskˈmɛnt/ ploy, gambit, strategy; exploit, gimmick, ruse, expedient

Etymology: unexplained phonetic alteration from Middle Boral velliskar “to con, to run a fraudulent scheme”, a borrowing from synonymous Portingale or Leon velliscar which also literally means “to pinch, to nibble”. This verb derives from a Vulgar Latin form vellicicō, a frequentative of vellicō “I pluck, twitch, pinch”.

    Broucabr a bas es vencr ne vellisquant.

31.3: guyer “anti-clockwise”

guyer /gaˈjɛr/ [gɐˈʝɛː]
- anticlockwise, (of circular motion) moving so as to progress in the opposite direction to the shadow of a gnomon on a sundial;
- awkward, perverse, obstinately refusing to act correctly or in a conventional manner

Etymology: borrowed in the eleventh century from Old French adverb guier “in the opposite direction, anti-clockwise” (modern guyaire by analogy with solaire “solar, clockwise”), from Frankish wither “back, against, again”. The word is attested in metaphorical use from as early as the thirteenth century, in records of medieval springtide ballads.

    Y fruyour gliðan tras l'area guyer.
    /i fraˈjur gliˈðan traz ˌla.reˈa gaˈjɛr/

31.4: bacchabond “Dionysian”

bacchabond /ˌba.kaˈbɔnd/ [ˌba.kɐˈbɔnd]
- bacchanalian, orgiastic, hedonistic, (as of a party or crowd) given to reveling and drunkenness;
- wild, uncontrolled, dionysian, without restraint or fetters in sheer extravagance or irrationality

Etymology: learned borrowing in the Revitalist period from Latin bacchābundus “revelling boisterously in the manner of the Bacchantes”. This is an adjectival derivation from Bacchus “Bacchus, Dionysus”, god of wine and revelry.

    N'yement e l'aucoum bacchabond veint save jo bon aïr par y convoc sbolognant a toð mell'amig.

31.5: The Deviance movement

The Deviance movement, also known as Anti-Paradise theology, is a religious, artistic and political ideology characterised by non-conformity as well as exploration of the avant-garde in all areas of society.

The term “deviance” has been applied to the movement almost since its inception, with both positive and negative affect. Some scholars have theorised that the term reflects the Wessern dialect pronunciation of standard “defiance”, although this is not widely accepted.
History

The Deviance movement arose in the late eighteenth century during the Long Peace, in an environment of rapid scientific progress. In Europe, much of the development of Anti-Paradise theology took place within the Promethean clubs of Albion and Danaw. These regions were both home to significant religious minorities and the Church (of whichever stripe) was strongly associated with local authority.

An important early work to the Deviance movement was the anonymously-published ‘And We Will Love the Fire’ (originally Et Nous Amerons les Fux), which began circulating in 1799 to immediate moral outrage. Though almost a dozen plausible candidates for its authorship have been seriously proposed, no consensus has ever been reached on the issue.

The early Deviance movement coincided with the height of the voidtale craze launched by Elsebeth Sneider’s 1795 trevold 'Through a Black Mirror’. Many of the ideas conjured in voidtale works were incorporated into Anti-Paradise theology, and Sneider’s works in particular were embraced by the movement. However, Sneider herself despised Anti-Paradism; in her own words:

    “It is not only their strange ideas and lonely, nihilist universe, dear Thifäne, but that so many of their number have approached me as if I were their most natural ally!”

The early public reaction to the Deviance movement varied significantly. It has been blamed for the resurgence of the Modest Arrangement in Spain and Gaul.

In 1850 a tide of secularisation began with the passing of the Laic Declarations in Belgrade, which have largely been credited to the strong influence of Anti-Paradise theology in the Riverine Cities after the collapse of Danaw.

In the later nineteenth century the Deviance movement was connected to the spread of the genre of masquira romance, possibly via their shared connections to tovarick communities.
Features

Many composers of the early nineteenth century were affiliated with the Deviance movement, and considered their music to be in the Deviant spirit. The music of Deviance composers emphasised emotion and the manipulation of the audience, and this helped make music the least controversial part of Anti-Paradism in its first few decades.

The Deviance movement was interested in folk traditions and stories; one example is the European tale of the Wild Hunt, which was portrayed in the younger Crayenschot’s opera Ad Pentaculum. They were particularly interested in those figures which had been cast as demons or evil spirits by the Church.

Supporters of the early Deviance movement are often portrayed as wearing lewd or otherwise-inappropriate clothing; it is difficult to ascertain the extent to which this reflected a real practice, as opposed to it being an invention by their detractors.
Notable supporters

    Dr Mickel Cráyenschot (fl. c19), physician in French Willemy and early public tovarick
    Lord Simon, sixth Baron Monçating (b. 1770), infamous libertine of the Damvath melee
    Poshack Nerwaman (fl. c19), famed lady explorer originally of Mashick, sister to the composer Mollam Bushta
    Ton Cráyenschot (fl. c19), composer remembered for the opera Ad Pentaculum, marked entirely in five

32.1: A Bookshop

another excerpt in translation from the first chapter of Clarissa Bellamy's 1920 work A Door, Once Opened.

Y livrary meðes aye galleir streit e darsoval, ant scaffal anneyað par tout entr picq descovannet e rig enter emplið de tom lort.
The shop itself was cramped and maze-like, with shelves overflowing with everything from pamphlets to great collections of heavy tomes.

32.2: suðel "patch"

suðel /siˈðɛl/ [sɪˈðɛw]
- patch, small piece of fabric used to mend an article of clothing;
- workaround, kludge, hack, a temporary repair intended to be of use for a limited time until a more lasting solution can be found
- plaster, an adhesive piece of material used to cover a wound

Etymology: inherited via Old Boral from Latin sūtēla "a sewing together, a cunning stratagem" (the second metaphorical sense having been lost already in post-Classical Latin). This is a nominal derivation from the verb suō "I sew, I stitch".

    Com suðel eu nos y fenestr zachettað ne closið.
    /kɔm siˈðɛl aw nɔz i feˈnɛstr̩ ˌza.kɛˈtaθ ne kloˈzɪθ/

32.3: oblimanç "passion"

oblimanç /ˌo.bliˈmants/ [ˌo.blɪˈmans]
- desire, craving, longing, strong attraction towards something or the condition of wanting something deeply;
- passion, enthusiasm, zeal, fervour, a powerful emotion or excitement in the pursuit of some end goal;

Etymology: nominal derviation from oblimar "to desire, crave", from synonymous Medieval Latin oblīmō (or directly from a Latin noun oblīmantia, though there is no record of this derivation in Latin until the fifteenth century). This verb is formed from the intensive prefix ob- and the verb līmō "I am eager for, I lust after".

In turn, līmō and the related noun līmus reflect a relatinisation of Old Boral lim "lust" (now archaic outside the expression lim aïr "be eager"), which must be a descendant of synonymous Latin libīdō (accusative libīdinem; compare the outcome of Latin -tūdinem as -tum in e.g. soltum "solitude", presumably via an intermediary -tūmine).

Nuvr ay jo un oblimanç aut vars possenç illimitabr.

32.4: vraseyant "impressive"

vraseyant /ˌvra.ziˈjant/ [vʀɐˈzjant]
- impressive, splendid, surprisingly good and tending to make a positive impression;
- moving, affecting, having a strong effect on somebody and especially causing them to feel a strong emotion;

Etymology: participial adjective from verb vraseyar "to impress, to surprise (positively), to move emotionally", itself a late medieval borrowing from Saxon wrasijn "to impact, affect, impress". This is thought to be of Slavic origin, from some descendant of *raziti "to strike, to astound" (usually supposed to be Polish wraziç "to instil, push").

Vossy loit autoschedon stan magn vraseyant.

32.5: Monarchs of Borland

summary of the lives of two rulers of Borland in the first millennium.

Victor Rossetus 'the Red-haired' (fl. c6) was the first Prase of the Boral Diocese. He was the first unitary ruler of an independent polity comprising a significant fraction of the island of Borland. He unified the urbanised east of the land while the west and south were settled by Angles to form Angland and Southbar, respectively, and it was under him that so-called 'Roman Borland' first began to succesfully repel the new settlers.

---

Jothey, King of Borland (fl. 898), known in Borlish as Joðeg /ʒoˈðij/, was the last ruler of the First Kingdom of Borland before it fell to the Danes in 898. The kingdom was conquered when Jothey was only a young man, shortly after his marriage to Brenna of Barrow, cousin of King Roderick of Dunclothe.

However, the life of King Jothey (as recorded in Brethin chronicles) continued as a monarch-in-exile for several more decades. He fled with his wife to Sothbar, where they had several children. They remained at court there for over twenty years, until the skirmishes between Sothbar and Dane Borland finally ended with Sothbar's capitulation and the unification of the island for the first time since being part of the Roman Empire.

Fearful of imprisonment or even execution so as to fully extirpate the former royal line and thus nullify the possibility of future rival claimants, Jothey fled once more with his wife and children to Kent.

33.2: çavel "brain"

çavel /tsaˈvɛl/ [tsɐˈvɛw]
- brain, brains, organ of the human or animal body responsible for perception, cognition and memory;
- intellect, mind, the capacity for intelligent or rational thought;
- (botany) pith, the soft and spongy white matter on the interior of a plant

Etymology: descending from Old Boral cea(r)vel, cerbel "brain", and reflecting Latin cerebellum "little brain, intellect", a diminutive of cerebrum "brain, skull". In the last sense it appears to be a Revitalist-period calque, since the Latin etymon could also refer to a plant's pith.

Y çavel de ty sour es parnommað.

33.3: zantr "zenith"

zantr /ˈzan.tr̩/ [ˈzan.tɐ]
- zenith, the point in the sky directly above a given position or observer;
- the highest point in the sky reached by a celestial body;
- (by extension) pinnacle, apex, acme, the high-water mark of a thing or trend's quality or popularity;
- fever pitch, climax, high drama, a state of extreme excitement or emotional investment

Etymology: borrowed in the Middle Boral period via French and Italian from Medieval Latin zantura, zamtaris et al. "zenith" (seen in various declension patterns but usually feminine in modern descendants). This is borrowed from Arabic
 سَمْت الرَّأْس‎ (samtu r-ra's) "direction of the head", the first part of which comes via Aramaic from Classical Latin sēmita "narrow footpath".

Sceye combat a spað ny zantr dy lasc.

33.4: gur "dread"

gur /gɪr/ [gɪː]
- dread, suspense, the feeling that something terrible is about to happen;
- gloom, pessimism, a black outlook resigned to terrible things happening
- sadness, depression, a state of melancholy

Etymology: from Old Boral g(r)ur "fear, dread", a borrowing from Old English gryre "terror, horror". This reflects Classical German grusias "fright" which is related to greusō "to frighten". Use of the noun in the shifted sense "sadness" is seen from the eighteenth century, principally in the constructions gur aïr "to be sad" and gur dar "to make sad".

Y scuir poðe noc le veir, oc gur luy dant.
/i xajr poˈðe nɔk le ˈvir | ɔk gɪr laj dant/

33.5: The Wars of Fealty

The Wars of Fealty were a series of conflicts between the polities of Albion in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries which lasted almost fifty years.

History
The traditional account asserts that the Wars of Fealty broke out due to a dispute over the location of the Redstone Chair, a low-backed wooden throne inlaid with a sandstone block said to have been the stone over which the tenth-century Elved Marriage (which ended hostilities between Dane Northumber and Markland for almost a century and on which many subsequent monarchs had been crowned) was solemnised.

As political alliances enmeshed the polities of Albion, over some years the entire island was dragged into the conflict. It threatened to spread further still: France spent nearly two decades with growing animosity towards Kent under the Two Henries to the north, but the two polities reached reconciliation in the early 1490s.

The relatively-new Kingdom of Britain (formed of Wales and its outlying tallaths, along with Kernow and Sodrick) started from a position of strength, and managed to extract many concessions in the early years of the wars. This culminated in the 1483 Battle of Rexam, which expanded the borders of Wales in the north and killed the last Duke of Chestre; after this, Britain was able to avoid the harsher conflicts of the wars' latter years.

In the final years of the Wars of Fealty, a code known as Thieves' Script was employed by the forces of Andrew III of Markland, apparently adapted from similar systems used by gangs of housebreakers in Nottingham. It is remembered today as a very early precursor of codes like steeplescript or modern one-zeffre encoding.

Aftermath
The poorer economic conditions of the Albic polities in the wake of the Wars of Fealty and the ongoing population displacements/migrations throughout the island left them woefully vulnerable to the ravages of the Second Great Dying. Almost twice as many deaths per capita are recorded in Markland and English Kent compared with Norman Kent or Willemy across the British Sea.

The advantageous position of the Kingdom of Britain, by contrast, contributed to the successses of King Howel of Britain's expansion of naval trade (typified by the ship Phœbos circumnavigating Africa and reaching Borune in 1516).

To the east, Borland (never directly involved in the Wars of Fealty) had received an influx of immigration from Albion, as people were displaced in the many border conflicts and attempted conquests. In particular, this period saw substantial Devoner and Kernish immigration to the cities of southern Borland.

34.2: sbay "gawp"

sbay /sbe/ [zbe]
- open-mouthed expression, the act of gawping at something or someone either in stupefaction or intrusive fascination

Etymology: deverbal derivation from sbayar "to gape, gawp" via Old Boral from Medieval Latin exbadō "I gape, open wide". The somewhat pejorative sense in Modern Boral is likely due to interference from the circumfix s- -ar (as in sboccar "to smirk"). The Latin is a derivative of synonymous badō, which is of unclear (possibly onomatopoeic) origin.

Cogmaðer son sbay dant ag cascat n'Onnacra.

- (obsolete) godsend, lucky break, a sudden large benefit and especially a sudden or unexpected large amount of money;
- gamble, venture, a significant risk undertaken with a potential gain;
- quest, undertaking, a journey or effort in pursuit of a goal

Etymology: from Old Boral falloft "windfall (both literally and metaphorically)", from Borland Old English feallovet "fruit that falls from trees in the wind", a compound of feallan "to fall" and ofett "fruit".

34.5: The Drengot Collusion

The Drengot Collusion was a multinational alliance-federacy in north-western Europe. Named for the older Drengot Empires (themselves named for the Norman noble family who first united much of Gaul and Albion), it grew from various treaties in the mid-nineteenth century into the principal power in the region until its dramatic collapse in 1961.

History
The Drengot Collusion arose among the French polities of the Global Workshop period. Shortly thereafter the New Urban Mesh (a collection of somewhat-autonomous cities including independent London, as well as Axbane on Borland) was subsumed—or took control of, depending on one's personal biases—the nascent Collusion.

The entirety of Borland entered the Collusion in 1894 as part of a series of events there that also led to the abdication of the Queen Natalia II and the concomitant dissolution of the Borlish monarchy.

Alongside the cities of London and Paris, Kent was the political centre of the Drengot Collusion, with many governmental buildings located in Rone.

Tensions between the Collusion and their southern neighbours (to wit, Vascony and Provence) grew particularly tense in the two decades following the Millstone War. For this reason it is notable that the Fiellas Dimenja newspaper (headquartered in Marsella) enjoyed considerable readership across the Collusion even in the 1930s.

Although Portingale was never part of the Collusion, it occupied a peripheral position in its orbit. This led to diplomatic tensions with Vascony, located directly between the Collusion and Portingale. For a time, Drengot astraphor supplied (via undersea powerline) much of the baric needs of Portingale, thus relying on Vascon goodwill not to interfere. This situation changed in the 1950s, with Portingale funding threshold mills to supply its own astraphor.

The Furore of 1961
At the time of the Furore, the Collusion was being administered by a tinplate government under Romney Darchild.

One of the scandals of the Furore was the revelation of the clandestine activities undertaken by the Red House (the popular name of the Collusion's Ministry for Information) in Rone. These activities, enumerated in the Darchild memorandum, acted as a powderkeg, first bringing down the current administration and shortly thereafter the entire Collusion.

Aftermath
One effect of the collapse of the Drengot Collusion was the implementation of the Kentish ostracon reforms, which would go on to be used as a model in several polities across the globe.

35.2: zillapr "buttercup"

zillapr /ziˈlapr̩/ [zɪˈla.pɐ]
- buttercup, crowfoot, any herbaceous plant of the genus Ranunculus which are characterised by having small yellow flowers;

Etymology: from early Middle Boral zilapre "buttercup", presumably from synonymous archaic Portingale (a)zialaparo, literally "bunny's boot". The word azia, laziga et al. "boot" is borrowed from Arabic أَحْذِيَة‎ • (ʾaḥḏiya) "leather boots", while the word laparo "young rabbit" is of obscure, perhaps pre-Roman Iberian, origin (compare borrowed Boral laprot "rabbit").

35.3: lon fregn "undoubtedly"

lon fregn /lɔn frijn/ [lʊɱˈfʀin]
- secure, completely safe, utterly protected from any danger or harm;
- certainly, definitely, unquestionably, without any doubt;
- no problem, no worries, phatic expression responding to an expression of thanks

Etymology: literally "without risk", phrase first seen in the sixteenth century in the first sense, extending to the second in the first few decades of its use. As a phatic expression it is briefly fashionable in the Good Game period, and returned to common use in the late twentieth century.

The preposition lon "without" descends from Latin longē "far off" (used as a preposition in Insular Latin even in the late Classical period), while the noun fregn "risk" is a borrowing from Old English frēcne "dangerous, risky".

Jo nil lon fregn reuvr pre un meis ben may.
/ʒo nɪl lɔn frijn ˈraw.vr̩ pre ɪn miz bɛn me/

35.4: heilant "dry land"

heilant /hiˈlant/
- dry land, terra firma, land as opposed to the sea (or later, the sky);
- landmass, a (typicaly large) continuous area of land surrounded by sea

Etymology: descendant of late Old Boral halant, haglant, helant etc. "dry land, places inland", a borrowing from Old English hēahland "the high ground". Formerly in use as an adverb meaning "inland, away from the shore" but replaced in this sense by derim by the seventeenth century outside of rural dialects.

During the tenth century and into the time of the Second Tetrarchy, Verona and its province were contested between the Kingdom of the Lombards (and latterly, Lombardy) and the German Empire. The Verona branch of the Adelchian dynasty ruled Lombardy during the eleventh century.

In the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, Verona was part of (and the most prosperous city in) the duchy of Furlain.

Verona was badly affected by the Second German War of the early nineteenth century. The arena in Verona, a classical amphitheatre, was reopened for performances shortly after the end of the war.

People
Chiarina Bruno (fl. 1824), librettist and composer who wrote the opera Wings Afire
Jacob III (1087-1130), king of Lombardy, who was the last of the Verona branch of the Adelchians to grow up in Verona

---

The Second German War (1815–23) was a conflict centred on German lands but involving almost all the polities of Europe. It took place in the early nineteenth century and marks the conventional end of the Long Peace. This war is considered part of the global phenomenon of Reaction War, which includes politically unrelated but contemporaneous conflicts around the world.

Although Vascony at first managed not to become embroiled in the conflict, once its interests in Mendeva and the East were threatened, then-king Hernand IV had no choice but to declare against the Northern Concert and in favour of the Convoy.

Borland participated in the war, with Borlish soldiers present alongside Bavarn and Furlaine fighters at the disastrously mismanaged Battle of Hulm in 1821.

The Northern Concert were a major power involved in the war, and they were allied with Borland, not uncontroversially—the alliance sparked many mozard protests in cities across the country.

The Kingdom of France was seen to have profited unjustly from the Second German War, gaining significant territory while (according to many) not investing much manpower or material resources.

In the 1820s and 30s, immigration to the Novomund (and especially to New Provence) spiked from those countries which had been most devastated by the war.

36.2: goðou "tunnel"

goðou /goˈðu/
- tunnel, an artificial underground or undersea passage through which vehicles may travel;
- flue, chimney, a pipe or duct that directs air or other gaseous products;
- subway, underpass, an underground walkway along which foot traffic moves

Etymology: a late Middle Boral borrowing from Norman gothove /goˈðuv/ "tunnel, passageway", itself via other European languages from Vascon godova /ˌgo.ðuvɐ/ with the same meaning. This reflects Welsh gυoðva "burrow, warren; tunnel", locative derivation of gυoð "mole".

Extended use in the sense of "chimney, flue" is widespread through nearby languages. The word has also been borrowed into Merch and has undergone folk etymology, becoming gothrow /ˈgu.ðɹə/ as though a univerbation of "go through".

Nos veyau lumner ag goðou dereðr.
/nɔz viˈjo lɪmˈnɛr ɛj goˈðu deˈrɛðr̩/

36.3: flagitar "insist"

flagitar /ˌfla.ʒiˈtar/ [ˌfla.ʝɪˈtɑː]
- insist, demand, ask continually and forcefully that something be done;
- insist, affirm, to hold up a claim emphatically;
- persevere, abide, to persist steadfastly in pursuit of an undertaking

Etymology: from the Middle Boral period in legal jargon, from Latin flāgitō "I require, solicit, accuse", possibly related to flagrum "whip, scourge, lash". The shift in emphasis to steadfastness has occurred by the eighteenth century.

Il son flagitant lour y port jamay zamicar.
/ɪl sɔn ˌfla.ʒiˈtant lur i pɔrt ʒaˈme ˌza.miˈkar/

36.4: smuïr "shatter"

smuïr / smaˈjɪr/ [zmɐˈjɪː]
- shatter, smash, to break into tiny pieces;
- crumble, disintegrate, to fall apart into tiny pieces;
- burst, explode, rupture, to break violently due to internal pressure

Etymology: originally in the second sense, verbal derivative of muy "crumb, granule, tiny piece", which descends unproblematically (although with a change in spelling in the late Middle Boral period) from Latin mīca "crumb, grain". More violent senses are attested from the sixteenth century.

Y tas smuïsceu pront la y paið quinar.

36.5: Wars and Rumours of Wars

a compilation of my notes on several major events in the history of the world around Borland.

The First German War (–1770) was a conflict in eighteenth-century Europe which cannot neatly be lumped in with the somewhat-earlier Democratic Wars. Its conclusion is usually taken as the start of the Long Peace.

Saxony was ascendant immediately following the First German War, controlling more territory than it had in any point in its history. This stood in in good stead for early industrialisation, especially in the capital of Lepzi.

-----

The Democratic Wars were a collection of international and civil wars which took place in the mid-eighteenth century.

The earliest incarnations of steeplepost technology are seen during the Democratic Wars; usually these consisted of lines of temporary signal towers which could only send simple coded messages, such as an hour to launch an assault. One more advanced and permanent system was used to connect Cordova to Malaga in Andalus during their particular conflict with Morrack.

Albion saw many changes in the aftermath of the Democratic Wars. Long contested between Markland and Kent, the city of London found itself newly independent for one final, lasting time.

The end of the Democratic Wars and the concomitant massive migrations of people is suspected to have contributed to the global spread of pennackit dystentery, which begins in earnest in 1753.a compilation of my notes on several major events in the history of the world around Borland.

excerpt in translation from 1899 housebound enigma 'The Letters in the Study', written by Iscombe author Cavra Herquet as an early and successful example of the genre.

Y heloit dy sorty ern affauðað an zoum remot candon Guilmet follau y galleir vogt ny manoir apar.
The noise of the party was a distant hum as Guilmet wandered through the empty corridors of the house.

37.2: seucq "footpath"

seucq /sawk/
- footpath, trail, a way set intentionally for people to walk along;
- trail, tracks, footsteps, those marks left by an animal or vehicle after it has passed by and which can be followed;
- legacy, aftereffects, impact, the consequences of a person's life and the ways in which they have changed the world;
- (in particular) descendants, progeny, one's children and their children etc. as opposed to one's forebears

Etymology: from Old Boral seucque, siuke "track, path", from Borland Latin silqua, sēlqua "track, trail (of an animal)". Thought to reflect a Borland Kelt word *seilquar, from earlier *sleiquro (in which case cognate with Welsh łωybr "path").  Extended in sense to metaphorical "things left behind one" at least by the fifteeneth century but probably earlier.

Nos trovaum un seucq forgað de laprot.

37.3: svattour "scout"

svattour /svaˈtur/ [zvɐˈtʊː]
- scout, a person or group of people sent out to perform reconnaissance or otherwise bring in information (especially in a military context);
- investigator, private detective, an agent hired by a person for the purpose of evidence gathering;
- harbinger, failsafe, early warning, a person or thing which gives advance notice (especially of danger or other unwanted occurrences)

also svattar /svaˈtar/ [zvɐˈtɑː] to scout, investigate, act as an early warning

Etymology: agent noun and verb from Middle Boral svat, svet "reconnaisance, scouting" (now obsolete), from synonymous early Saxon sweat /zvɛːt/. The word was borrowed in the thirteenth century, during the various conflicts subsequent to the German Secession. Extension from military contexts is attested in the eighteenth century, with its use by the svattour pavar private detectives of Damvath.

Nos nolau hur dar for an svattour noscon confiabr.

37.4: fouceur "handsome"

fouceur /fuˈtsawr/ [fʊˈtsa.wɐ]
- handsome, pretty, having a pleasing appearance and especially (of a person) being physically attractive;
- charming, charismatic, exuding personal charm and inducing people around to like one;
- (archaic or affected) wily, sneaky, full of clever tricks making one difficult to keep up with or predict

Etymology: from Middle Boral, originally in the last sense as an attributive use of the (now-obsolete) noun fouceur "rascal, trickster". This reflects Old Boral fo(r)cevr "rogue, blackguard", a direct descendant of Latin furcifer "scoundrel, (derogatory) slave", literally "yoke-bearer". The shift in sense from "deceptive > wily > charming > handsome" is somewhat extreme, yet every stage (occurring over approximately two centuries from 1650 to 1850) is well-attested in the historical record.

Cain Celest e Marca un per fouceur.
/ken tseˈlɛst e marˈka ɪn pɛr fuˈtsawr/

38.2: teir "to number"

teir /tir/ [tɪː]
- number, be, to consist of some number of people or things in a group;
- come to, cost, be worth some amount of money;
- be (at a distance of), be located, to exist at some specified distance from or height above a reference point;
- (obsolete except in certain idiomatic expressions) be had by, to be in the possession of somebody

Etymology: from Old Boral teir "to span, to cover (an amount of land), to stretch (a distance)", from Latin tegō "I cover up, I clothe". Extended to many contexts in which the object of a copular phrase is a quantity or amount of substance.

Y centuir de vossy fraðr tein dou lau dy castel.

38.3: quic “active”

quic /kwɪk/
- active, working, on, having the power of acting (especially, of moving or of functioning as a person or machine);
- in progress, ongoing, presently being undertaken;
- conscious, awake, up, (of a person) not asleep and especially being out of bed

Etymology: from Old Boral quic “alive, awake”, a borrowing from Old English cwic “living, live; intelligent, keen”. Formerly also used of plants for “thriving, growing well” which likely represents an intermediate meaning between its original sense and the more common modern usage.

    Hau, ty diac no’s quic!

38.4: hiat “pause”

hiat /hjat/ [çat, jat]*
- pause, lull, a period of reduced activity;

- (theatre, film) intermission, interval, the break between two parts of a drama;
- (music notation) rest, a symbol indicating that one’s instrument is not to be played

Etymology: sixteenth-century borrowing reflecting Norman hiat, Lombard hiato or another similar cognate, originally in the musical sense. These are taken directly from Latin hiātus “opening, gap, aperture, cleft”, a noun derivation from hiō “I yawn, gape, am open”.

    Nos benoçaum y hiat por douçur acatar.
    /nɔz ˌbe.noˈtsom i hjat pɔr duˈtsɪr ˌa.kaˈtar/

38.5: Steeplepost

Steeplepost refers to any of a group of similar technologies (flag-lamp, barrick, longform, gyre, etc.) used for transmitting messages over long distances.

Development
The very earliest incarnations of the steeplemesh arose during the Democratic Wars of the mid-eighteenth century, but these tended to be single lines of temporary signal towers set up to span terrain that made it too costly to simply send a rider with a message. Moreover, these were set up only to transmit simple messages; for example, an hour to launch an attack.

These early wartime towers usually relied on lampfire and thus were reliable only at night, or else a collection of patterned flags, which were usable at day but required a shorter distance between watchtowers. The two-arm system, allowing up to nine separate states to be transmitted, was first tested in Thynen (a town in Willemy), where the church's weathervane was reportedly commandeered to send the first lines of the Pater Noster to the neighbouring town Bost. (Hence, probably, the name “steeplepost”.)

By 1820 Ambrosia had unveiled its Steeplepost Tapestry in Aiga d'Angoixa, which promised to allow the (very slow) transmission of images along the lines by communicating the brightness of each pip in an enormous grid, in the manner of a cross-stitch. It was on the Tapestry that the infamous Lies of 1824 were first displayed.

The very first cross-sea steeplepost lines were established around the same time, with air-steeples in the Rustigh Strait connecting Borland to Willemy during the 1830s. This link would last only until 1854, however, when it was replaced with a barrick line.

The middle of the nineteenth century saw the flag-lamp system gradually superseded by barrick lines generally. Uptake was uneven owing to the twin constraints of geography and vested interests; for example, Mendevan powers tended to embrace the new technology more enthusiastically than their similarly-situated Vetomundine counterparts.

The new lines made partially-automated transmission much easier to develop. A prototype wired tachygraph, the Vilmanas Teleclavia, first succesfully sent a message via the steeplemesh in 1859.

Encoding
Steeplescripts, or methods by which a message is translated into a transmissible form, have many forerunners in secret codes used for spycraft and warfare. For example, Markland under King Andrew III during the Wars of Fealty employed "Thieves' Script" to send secret messages, converting each letter or common word into a series of three symbols.

One early line in Andalus (from Cordova to Málaga, usually given as the first line connecting two major cities, and essentially just formalising the signal system that had existed for the duration of their conflict with Morrack) used a variant of the ancient Polybius square adapted for Arabic script.

The first modern steeplescript was developed in Cracow by engineer Sigmund Adamich and his son Andrei as part of the royal initiative to connect Cracow to Bitom, using a set of four symbols, traditionally referred to as "dot, dash, bar and hook".

Cultural Detaxion
The spread of the steeplemesh reduced overland communication times extremely rapidly (by the end of the nineteenth century some places boasted thrice-daily post delivery, not to mentioned the nascent wired tachygraphs), and undersea barrick links would further connect the world.

Steeplemesh may have contributed to the decline of the voidtale fashion, demystifying formerly-unknowable distant lands and weakening the cultural narrative of the pioneering documentarian explorer.

39.2: sovragl "belt"

sovragl /soˈvrɛjl/ [sʊˈvʀɛjʊ]
- belt, girdle, a band worn around the waist to hold clothing (usually pants) to one's body;
- sash, cummerbund, a decorative band of cloth worn across the body;

Etymology: direct descendant from Latin subligāculum "loincloth, kilt" exhibiting l-r dissimilation (attested from as early as c8 in Old Boral sovreiaȝle "waistband, overskirt") likely reinforced by the etymologically-unrelated prefix sovr- "over, above". Synchronically analysable as sovrar "pass, go over" + -agl, an unproductive nominal suffix producing words for tools or other instruments.

Y sovragl seyon me dað er adornað par fylau.

39.3: laur mettr coll'un man "take matters into one's own hands"

laur mettr coll'un man /lor ˈmɛtr̩ kɔˈlɪn man/ [loː ˈmɛ.tɐ kʊˈlɪmˌman]
- take matters into one's own hands, to deal with a problem alone especially if due to others responsible having failed to tackle it;
- shoulder responsibility, to accept that one is responsible for something bad or difficult;
- (more generally) get to work, to start doing a (usually lengthy or otherwise-challenging) job;
- (jocular or self-effacing) masturbate, to stimulate oneself with the hands

Etymology: Idiom in use since the Middle Boral period, literally "to put work with the one hand". It is an extension of preexisting laur mettr "to tackle an issue, to take a job", from now-rare laur "work" < Latin labor (or a deverbal from laurar "to work") and mettr "to put" < Latin mittō "I send". In the last sense, first attested in writing in 1883 (possibly; more certain usages by the early c20), via a lewd reinterpretation of the literal sense of the idiom.

Ða vos nouð l'occeir jo met laur coll'un man!

##

39.4: ençar voug "be completely wrong"

ençar voug /ɛnˈtsar vuj/ [ɪnˈtsɑː vuj]
- be completely wrong, to miscalculate or misjudge entirely so that one's answer or action does not resemble the correct one in any respect;
- do something incorrectly, to perform an action (especially to operate a machine or to attempt an artistic endeavour) with absolutely nothing approaching expertise or skill;
- be utterly useless at, to have no talent whatsoever for a particular skill

Etymology: Idiom attested from the sixteenth century, literally meaning "to start incorrect". The verb ençar "to begin, start" is a direct descendant of Latin initiō "I begin, originate", while the adjective voug "wrong, mistaken, incorrect" is a medieval borrowing from Old English wōh "wrong, crooked, bent" (giving modern Merch ough /uːf/ "bad").

Il ençan y dou voug cas toriot luïr.

39.5: Andalus

Andalus is a polity in the south of the Spanish peninsula. The languages of Morrove Arabic and Mostara Spanish are both widely spoken in the region.

History
Ninth-century Andalus saw the flowering of theoretic advancements; in particular, glassmaking techniques accelerated rapidly due to a cut-off of supply from the east, leading to the prodigious export of so-called "jackdaw glass".

The Brethin religious order spread into the Christian-majority areas of Andalus from the north during the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Around this time Andalus lost significant territory in the north and east to Christian polities, such as the newly-established Kingdom of Barcelon.

In the fifteenth century, while its neighbour Vascony was ascendant, Andalus was beset by struggles. Controlled from across the straits by Morrack, its issues included two successive succesion crises as well as the 1457 Lisbon Massacre.

Vascony was forced to cede Portingale, its economic heart, to Andalus after a series of military successes in the Romantic Wars of the mid-seventeenth century.

Andalus was embroiled in conflict with Morrack (as its neighbour attempted a reconquest) for a prolonged period in the eighteenth century; some but not all of the involved skirmishes are traditionally grouped with the concurrent Democratic Wars unfolding globally. A signalling line from Cordova to Málaga set-up at this time would develop into the world's first steeplepost connection between two major cities.

People
Abdul Raman IV (fl. 1188), ruler of the Admiralty of Cordova under the Single Caliphate
Joan Bensaíd (fl. 1951), author of the 1951 scholastic quire 'The Communication Toolset' (El Herramente de Communicazón)
Jorala (fl. c18-19), landscape artist born in Cazris whose later work was influenced by the voidtale craze
Judeta Barracin (fl. 1919), author who helped pioneer the genre of social comedy with her work 'Flaxen Hearts'
Tal of Murcia (fl. 1211), medieval scholar who in 1211 wrote 'On Unknown Areas Scribed by Arcs'

40.2: batman "vigilante"

batman /batˈman/
- vigilante, one who acts outside the law to right a perceived wrong (often to avenge a murder or similar act of violence);
- mercenary, hitman, one who enacts violence (especially assassinations) for hire;
- warfarer, warrior, combatant, one engaged in warfare as a member of a band of soldiers

Etymology: seventeenth-century clipping of earlier abatman "combatant, mercenary", which descends from Old Boral abat manc/ç "mercenary (band), hired soldier", literally "war-seller". The first element abat "war" is a deverbal noun from abatr "fight, make war" (modern abattr), while the second manc/ç "seller, stall, booth" is of unclear origin.

The status of the final consonant in manc/ç (since lost) is disputed. If palatalised /mants/, the word is thought to reflect Insular Latin manentia "shop, household, inn", nominal derivative of maneō "I stay, remain, spend the night" (compare fenç "split, break" from Latin findentia < findō "I cleave, split"). The alternative theory that it descends from Latin merx "goods, wares" (modern març) is semantically tempting but phonetically implausible.

If instead the word is unpalatalised /mank/, it is generally agreed that it reflects Latin mangō "dealer, seller (of slaves)", either directly from the Latin—although one would expect to see also *mangon < mangōnem—or via the Old English descendant mangian "to trade, traffic in". In either case, the final consonant does not appear anywhere after the eleventh century, perhaps due to influence from the English suffix -man "person, man".

Se poðe noc l'eç rumour d'un batman corroular.

40.3: oscbou "porthole"

oscbou /oxˈbu/
- porthole, gunport, a window set into the hull of a ship for cannons to fire through (or in modern use simply for the view);
- hatch, an (often internal) opening in a wall for people to pass things such as prepared food through

Etymology: Middle Boral borrowing from contemporary Vascon ox (de) buy /ɔʃ de bwi/ "gunport", literally "ox's eye". The word ox "eye" descends from Latin oculus and is cognate with Boral ogl /ɔjl/, while the word buy "ox" was adapted to the Boral bou "ox", both from Latin bōs, bovem "cow".

    Pront jo vis pall'oscbou my sour cocinant.

40.4: nell'eutað "trendy"

nell'eutað /ˌnɛ.lawˈtaθ/ [ˌnɛ.lɐwˈtah]
- fashionable, trendy, à la mode, in, up to date with the latest fashions and allowing one to display having good taste, a refined aesthetic sense or simply ample wealth

Etymology: adpositional phrase literally meaning "in the current fashion", attested since the late eighteenth century originally among the aristocratic melle of Borland's major cities. The noun eutað "mode, fashion, vibe, zeitgeist, style" is a nominal derivation from the verb eir "to go" (compare the past participle eut "gone"), which descends directly from Latin eō "I go".

Y cambr ayen pieðry nuaç nell'eutað.
/i ˈkam.br̩ ɛˈjɛn pjɛðˈri njats ˌnɛ.lawˈtaθ/

40.5: Albion

Albion is the largest of the Northwestern Isles, situated directly north of Gaul. To its west and east lie Ireland and Borland, respectively.

History
Germanic migration from the continent into Albion took place through the fifth and sixth centuries, leading to the establishment of Markland, Kent, Wessex, Anglia, Northumber and several smaller and short-lasting kingdoms.

The westward encroachment of Saxons drove a emigration of Kelts from (what would become) Devon to Kernow, and for the period between the Battle of Gaulford (656) and Vigo the Magnificent's reconquest the entire peninsula was under the sole authority of Wessex.

The original calling of the Brethin religious order, founded in the eighth century, was to chronicle the Christianisation of Albion and Ireland.

Vikings raids began in Albion with the destruction of Halgrive in 824, although news of Dane incursions would have travelled west from Borland for some years by that point. While Northumber would fall completely to Dane rule, neighbouring Markland withstood (due perhaps to a fortunate lull in its perennial conflict with the Welsh kingdoms) even as much of its eastern territory was settled by the Danes.

The Guithle kingdom of Scotland was established in the ninth century with the help of Harald the Blue of Sodrick, displacing or merging with the existing Pict culture and language.

Sodrick lost much of its territory to the kingdom of Dunclothe in the tenth century, as it had been weakened by extended vikings to the east and the short-term decline in the Dane Supremacy.

By the turn of the second millennium, the south of the island is dominated by an expanded Kent (having recently subdued the remains of Wessex) below Markland and a now-unified Kingdom of Wales. To the north lie the confederate kingdoms of the Danes and then a Scotland even now influenced by Norse and English peoples.

Much of southern Albion was conquered in the eleventh century by Normandy (with the aid of Devon in the form of the Kernovan Conjuring), consolidating the island bar Wales as far north as Edinbrough into what would become the First Drengot Empire.

The kingdom of Wales began to expand in the thirteenth century, conquering Devon after a long campaign. Tensions with Markland remained high (as they had done for almost a millennium), with the reignition of the Mallor Wars and the sack of Car Vantel/Rexam in 1301.

The late fifteenth century saw much of Albion (and some of its neighbours) embroiled in the Wars of Fealty, which lasted for forty-six years. While other polities in Europe sought to expand their trade meshes (either westward following the Novomundine Landfall or exploiting new routes to Asia), the majority of the wealth and armies of Albion was dedicated to war.

The polities of Albion were still recoving from the Wars of Fealty in 1519 and thus were extremely vulnerable to the Second Great Dying.

Albion saw many changes in the aftermath of the Democratic Wars of the eighteenth century. Long contested between Markland and Kent, the city of London found itself newly independent for one final, lasting time.

The Long Peace around the turn of the nineteenth century saw the Deviance movement take root across Albion, initially via the mesh of Promethean clubs that had arisen over the preceding decades. The movement flourished perhaps due to Albion's many religious minorities and the strong association of the Church with local authority.

41.1: A Baptism of Fire

excerpt in translation from A Baptism of Fire: Christianity and the Graven, written by Agata Naziunas and published in 1988 by Leidéiai Givatés.

Of particular interest is the duchy of Crain, which importantly controlled the prosperous city of Verona, as well as fertile lands further east.

Their declaration in support of the Roman Papacy was likely more pragmatic than out of true religious fervour, but in any case they were perfectly positioned to contribute to the Baptism of the North.

Though the Order of Saint Hemma of Still Water (the Convoy Australier) had been leading the Baptism with monetary backing from Taxon of Hungary for several decades, it is in the context of the German Secession that the Baptism became an urgent project.

Along with a new, more totalist Pope in Hermeneus II, it was feared that Augsburg might spread heresy faster than Rome could reach the North.

41.2: batesm "baptism"

batesm /baˈtɛ.zm̩/ [bɐˈtɛ.zɐm]
- baptism, christening, the Christian rite in which a person (usually a child) is received into the church and given a name;
- (more generally) naming, the act of giving a person or thing a name;
- induction, hazing, any ceremony whose purpose is to introduce new members to some association, especially if the process if unpleasant or even dangerous

Etymology: via Old Boral batesme "baptism, christening" and synonymous Late Latin baptisma from Ancient Greek βάπτισμα (báptisma, "dipping in water, baptism"). Used outside of a Christian context from as early as the late thirteenth century; in the last sense it arises in the student culture of Vithor in the eighteenth century.

41.3: orn "order; rowan"

orn /ɔrn/ [ɔːn]
1.
- order, ordering, arrangement, programme, a particular sequence or way of setting out a collect of people, objects or events;
- order, group, troop, band, a number of people in a formal arrangement towards the furthering of some agenda (in particular, playing music or purveying violence or similar aid);
- command, captaincy, power, the position of having authority to require people to do something;
- recipe, program, instructions, algorithm, a list of steps itemising the proper method for achieving some task

Etymology: either from a native Old Boral orne, ordne, "ordering, arrangement" or borrowed from contemporaneous Old French orne, ordre, both reflecting (as a direct descendant or an early semi-learned loan) Latin ōrdō, ōrdinem "arrangement, rank, group, troop, rite". Extended senses almost definitely adapted directly from the Latin reflex in the Middle Boral period (cf. short-lived later borrowing ordin).

Nos luïsceu primer nell'orn.

2.
- mountain ash, rowan, any of several trees in the genus Sorbus, found across Europe and Mendeva;
- (proscribed) ash, tree of the genus Fraxinus (prescriptively, frasn);
- javelin, lance, a light spear thrown with the hand and used as a weapon

Etymology: Direct descendant of Latin ornus "mountain ash, rowan" via the synonymous orne in Old Boral. In the last meaning, a conscious revival of an Old Boral usage which had vanished for centuries.

L'ivan asseye sur y ranscel dell'orn.

41.4: soçavau "aside"

soçavau /ˌso.tsaˈvo/ [ˌso.tsɐˈvo]
- aside, sidenote, comment, remark, an incidental statement made quietly or in such a way that most people cannot hear it;
- (theatre, film) nondiegetic dialogue, dialogue said by characters or a narrator directly to the audience, so that the (other) characters cannot hear it;
- afterthought, a post-hoc idea or comment that only occurs after the time when it might have been a useful contribution

Etymology: eighteenth-century borrowing from Vascon soza-vau "aside, commentary, lit. under-voice", originally in the context of theatrical performance. The preposition soza "under, beneath" descends from Latin adverb subta, with influence from the form soz < subtus; the noun vau "voice" is an alteration of earlier vou, from the synonymous Latin vōcem.

Y scuir dau un soçavau losc ne parmanent a pie.
/i xajr do ɪn ˌso.tsaˈvo lɔx ne ˌpar.maˈnɛnt a pje/

41.5: Gurjat

Gurjat is a polity on the western coast of India.

History
The medieval period saw a flourishing of mathematics across India, and Gurjat was no exception. For instance, the now-familiar angle addition identities for vatre and arrhumb [sine and cosine] were first noted by the mathematicians of the city of Ujén.

Gurjat was one of the stopping points for the British ship the Phœbos under Captain mac Kellot during its famed voyage in the early sixteenth century. The ship spent several months at port there in 1512, after having circumnavigated Africa and before continuing on to Madray [Madurai] and thence to the Great Borunesk Meeting of 1516.

Gurjat enjoyed a significant trade empire in the seventeenth century, spanning from African ports like Ungotia [Zanzibar] and even Vascon-controlled Sant Adrian [Bioko] in the west to Cathay (and eventually New Leudong) in the east. Gurjat traders made up a good fraction of those merchants expelled from Moscat in 1652, several months before the fall of the Ibadine Imamate to Hadramot forces.

42.2: lon-lembic "teetotaller"

lon-lembic /ˌlɔn.lɛmˈbɪk/
- teetotaller, non-drinker, one who abstains from drinking any alcoholic beverages;
- alcohol-free drink, a beverage which has been altered so as not to contain any alcohol

Etymology: first attested 1902 as a univerbation of phrase lon lembic "without alcohol", probably adapted from slightly earlier French and Dutch compounds. The word lon "without" reflects Latin adverb longē "far away". The noun lembic "ethanol; (more broadly) alcoholic drink" descends from Scholastic Latin lembīcum "alembic, still; (later) distilled spirits", which is borrowed via Arabic from Greek ἄμβῑξ (ámbīx) "cup with a spout; alembic".

Cascif eð vos un lon-lembic convoccað ac?
/kaˈxɪf ɛθ vɔz ɪn ˌlɔn.lɛmˈbɪk ˌkɔn.vɔˈkaθ ak/

##

42.3: murðon "ten thousand"

murðon /mɪrˈðɔn/
- myriad, the number ten thousand;
- countless, a very great number

Etymology: from Old Boral murð, mirð "countless, very many; ten thousand" with the addition of then-productive augmentative suffix -on (from Latin nominal derivational suffix -ō, -ōnem). In turn this word is a semi-learned form via Late Latin mȳrias, mȳriadem from Ancient Greek μῡρῐᾰ́ς (mūriás) "ten thousand, countless".

The forms with <u> (reflecting [ʏ]) instead of expected <i> is unlikely to be any remnant of Hellenising Latin <y> /y/ (which was never common as far afield as Borland). More plausible is a sporadic labialising effect from the preceding /m/, also seen in words like mug < Latin mīca "crumb".

In the Old Boral period it is most often used indeterminately for any large quantity; its more specific sense returns to common use (initially in merchant accounts) in the thirteenth century.

Y gent ne Safford Outr tein 440 murðon.
/i ʒɛnt ne saˈfɔrd utr̩ tin katr̩ kaˈrɛnt mirˈðɔn/

42.4: nervous "confident"

nervous /nɛrˈvuz/
- confident, assured, optimistic, having confidence in one's ability to accomplish something;
- bold, fearless, daring, showing a willingness to take risks or acting without reservation;
- vigorous, robust, energetic, being healthy and strong and characterised by lively activity;
- (dated or humorous, of meat) sinewy, stringy containing tough fibres and thus being difficult to eat

Etymology: from Middle Boral nervous "sinewy; vigorous", borrowed from synonymous Latin nervōsus along with noun nerf < Latin nervus "nerve, sinew; vigour". The extension in meaning from "vigorous" to "bold" and then to "confident" had taken place by the start of the nineteenth century.

Son il nervous d'issaur ny cors?

42.5: Two Pens

collected notes on a couple of the many famous people from across the history of this alternate world.

Ezio Carvallo (fl. 1860) was a Portingale author most remembered for his contributions to the development of the genre of masquira romance.

Works
Tejan de Masquira ou Jalico (In Either a Mask or a Suit), a 1860 work which would be the first in a twelve-strong series of tales following the vigilante thief Matthias o Grallon.
The book was released in Kentish in 1865 as 'We Arive in Unwemmed [Immaculate] Clothes', translated by Christopher Wood; Anscon Polgat translated the book into Boral under the title 'Cuscon Reðr Cognit' (Whoever [We Are] Behind [Our] Disguises)

--

Catrin of Kernow (d. 1233) was an influential figure in Tetrarchic Borland.

Family
Catrin of Kernow was the elder sister of King Alan VI of Greater Devon, who orchestrated the Realignment of Devon in 1225. Their uncle was Damian the Wise, the first (Roman) Pope to be elected from among the Brethin religious order.

Legacy
In 1292 the chronicle 'Y Við a Catrin de Cornou' (The Life of Catrin of Kernow) was written, detailing her early life, marriage into Borlish noblility and eventual assassination in 1233. The chronicle is particularly important for being the first longform work written in Borlish (as opposed to Latin) about a lay-person.

43.2: janualtað "hindsight"

janualtað /ˌʒa.njalˈtaθ/ [ˌʝa.njɐwˈtah]
- hindsight, retrospection, an understanding of the significance and nature of events after they have occurred;
- perspective, unblinkeredness, the ability to see a situation from a sufficiently uninvolved position that one can understand it without distraction or bias

Etymology: Middle Boral borrowing alongside adjective janual "retrospective, backward-looking" from Scholastic Latin iānuālitās "hindsight", both derivatives of iānua "doorway, entrance" or Iānus "Janus, two-headed god of transitional spaces".

Me valois noc y fabr assistr con my maðr.

43.3: mordeth "expedition"

mordeth /mɔrˈdɛθ/
- expedition, an often-military undertaking involving travel either into enemy territory or some analogous target;
- raid, foray, incursion, a short-term and violent move into a region to ransack it for spoils or to inflict damage;
- jaunt, adventure, a short excursion for diversion or pleasure especially involving some (possibly planned) excitement;
- (historical) crusade, conquest, any of the military expeditions undertaken in the medieval Middlesea under varying degrees of Papal authority

Etymology: early Middle Boral borrowing from contemporary Welsh mordeith "sea voyage, raid, conquest by sea", corresponding to a compound of modern moωr "sea" and teith "journey, trip". Originally used in particular for the various wars of conquest in the Middlesea conducted at a significant distance during the eleventh to thirteenth centuries. While some of these had ostensible religious authority motivating them, many (especially further from the Masreck [Levant]) were more transparently opportunistic.

Il feirn mordeth amont por y poið dy Nil trovar.

43.4: toxen "alarm"

toxen /tɔkˈsɛn/ [tʊgˈzɛn]
- alarm, klaxon, a sound intended to give notice of approaching danger or an upcoming deadline;
- (more genereally) warning, alert, signal, any means of informing someone of a new (especially a problematic) development

Etymology: early Middle Boral borrowing from Old French tocsin, tocseing etc. "alarm, ringing of a bell" (originally in a military context), itself from Old Vascon toca-segn "alarm", literally "strikes (a) bell". These reflect respectively Vulgar Latin toccāre "to touch" and Latin signum "signal, mark".

Da mey toxen pront la Yam Olau veir.

43.5: Barcelon

Barcelon is a Middlesea polity in the east of the Spanish peninsula.

History
In its early existence from the ninth to the thirteenth century, the county of Barcelon (soon to be the duchy and indeed from 1067 the kingdom) was ruled by the House of Barcelon. It had perennial skirmishes with Tolose to the north, so that even when Tolose became a vassal state to the First Drengot Empire in the eleventh century, it maintained a standing army for protection against Barcelon.

By the late twelfth century, the Kingdom of Barcelon controlled significantly more territory at the expense of Andalus, including the population centres of Saragossa, Valencia and (briefly) Toledo.

Barcelon conquered the region of Tolose from Ascendant Vascony in the first decade of the sixteenth century, thereby (along with territorial gains by Burgundy) depriving it entirely of its Middlesea coastline. In the same period, the War for the Barcelon Succession took place, although notably it only lasted for four days.

The early sixteenth century also saw Barcelon rattle sabres with the newly independent Provence, involving piratical raids on Provincial cities (and especially Marsella) supported financially by Barcelon. Part of the resolution involved the region of Narbona having double obligations to King James III of Barcelon and to Lord Amigòt in Provence.

The longest-reigning monarch of the Kingdom of Barcelon is James VI (Jaume VI), who ruled into the eighteenth century for 58 years and after whom is named the famous jaumetia, a whitefish stew.

jou follant /ʒu fɔˈlant/ [ʝu fʊˈlan(t)]
- on the fence, undecided, weighing pros and cons, not having chosen between one of many (especially two) options;
- between a rock and a hard place, facing a dilemma, being in a difficult situation with no obviously good options

Etymology: idiom first attested in the seventeenth century, literally meaning "walking on a balance beam", with the image of an acrobat balancing on a seesaw. The noun jou "yoke, carrying pole, balance beam, seesaw" descends directly from Latin iugum with the same meaning, while the verb follar "to walk along, to tread" reflects Old Boral follar "to stamp, crush, tread on", from a Latin noun via Late Latin fullō "I trample, I full (cloth)".

L'er jou follant cas l'empley all'ambit acceptar.

44.3: carrug mettr avant naumagl "get ahead of oneself"

carrug mettr avant naumagl /kaˈraj ˈmɛtr̩ aˈvant noˈmɛjl/
- get ahead of oneself, count one's eggs before they hatch, jump the gun, to start on some activity without being adequately prepared;
- put the cart before the horse, make a mountain out of a molehill, to mix up one's priorities and treat minor things as being disproportionately important (or vice versa)

Etymology: idiom used since the medieval period in various languages but first seen in its modern form in Boral in the sixteenth century. The phrase literally means "to put the cart in front of the oxen", in which the noun carrug "cart" descends via Old Boral carruȝ from synonymous Late Latin carrūca (from Gaulish).

Meanwhile, naumagl "ox, castrated bull employed as a draught animal" enters the language in the early Middle Boral period from Norman un naumail /nawˈmaʎ/ "an ox/a steer", rebracketed from earlier un aumail, itself a masculine variant of aumaille "cattle, livestock". This comes from earlier almaille, armaille, from Latin neuter plural animālia "animals" reinterpreted as a feminine singular.

Mettau noc carrug avant naumagl; ja n'eu nos y muncef meðes saut.
/mɛˈto nɔk kaˈraj aˈvant noˈmɛjl | ʒa naw nɔz i mɪnˈtsɛf meˈðɛz sot/

44.4: hurstar "equip"

hurstar /hɪrˈstar/ [hɪːˈstɑː]
- equip, be supplied with, to obtain something necessary (especially weaponry or similar tools) in order to carry out a specific action or task;
- don, put on, to clothe oneself with some article of clothing or accessory;
- be taught, self-teach, train oneself in, to learn a particular skill in preparation for some specific situation

Etymology: descendant of Old Boral hurstar "decorate, adorn" with a shift in argument structure (the patient changing from the thing receiving ornament to the items used to adorn) in evidence from the fourteenth century onward. This itself is a borrowing from synonymous Old English hyrstan; compare Merch hirstend /ˈhɪːsən/ "decorative, extra, superfluous".

Dou xiphar hurstaurn glay e me lou svingaurn.
/du ksiˈfar hɪrˈstorn̩ gle e me lu svɪnˈgorn̩/

44.5: Cordin and Brenna

collected notes on a major population centre on Borland, as well as the last queen of the First Kingdom of Borland.

Cordin is a city in Borland. It is known for its prolific press Cordin Editions, which from the late twenthieth century on has provided textbooks to schools nationwide. Its name is usually considered to be unrelated to the Borlish word cordin "string".

History
In the late 1660s the young James V of Barcelon was a ward in Cordin.

By the Long Peace period Cordin had become one of the largest cities on the island, with a thriving high society to rival that of the capital in Damvath.

People
Professor Marc Jeichey (fl. 2019), lecturer in concurrence history at the University of Cordin who spent some years working in peripatetico at the Dijon New School
Theign Roufler (fl. 2016), scholar and author of book 'From Tablets to Slates: The Story of Education' (Des Delt vars Dois : Y Stoir d'Education)

---

Brenna of Barrow (fl. 898) was the cousin of King Roderick of Dunclothe. She married the young King Jothey of Borland shortly before the First Kingdom of Borland fell to the Danes in 898. Subsequently she fled with her husband to Sothbar, where she bore several children.

Two decades later Sothbar surrendered to Dane Borland and the family were forced to flee once more, this time to Kent. Much of our knowledge of the remainder of her life is preserved through the Brethin copies of her correspondence with her aging uncle in Dunclothe.

45.2: sortir ag vousc "to tryst"

sortir ag vousc /sɔrˈtɪr ɛj vux/
- to tryst, rendezvous, to meet somebody in private to be intimate with them;
- to hook up, to have a casual sexual experience with someone

Etymology: idiom attested from the late eighteenth century but probably older, literally meaning "to go out to the strawberries". The verb sortir "to go out" is a descendant of Latin sortior "to draw by lots, to distribute" with an unclearly-motivated but very early semantic change (compare cognate forms across Gaul and northern Italy).

The noun vousc "strawberry" reflects Old Boral baȝ vousc (cf. modern Boral bag /bɛj/ "berry"), presumably a calque of Old English’s synonymous stréawberȝe "strew-berry", so called for its plant growing low down, the fruits appearing to have been strewn across the ground. The putative verb ?voscar/vojar "to strew, scatter" is otherwise unattested, however—it is tempting to postulate a borrowing from Borland Kelt.

Nos venau de retornar posc sortir ag vousc.
/nɔz veˈno de ˌre.tɔrˈnar pɔx sɔrˈtɪr ɛj vux/

##

45.3: ollem "elm"

ollem /ɔˈlɛm/ [ʊˈlɛm]
- elm, (especially) wych elm, tree of the genus Ulmus with asymmetric leaves and small petalless flowers;
- (slang, sometimes derogatory) person from Pentrose, a port town on the south coast of Borland, especially in the context of regional rivalry or applied to someone of British descent

Etymology: via Old Boral olem "elm", apparently reflecting an unattested Insular Latin ulēmus as a variant of ulmus "elm" influenced by Kelt *lēm "elm". We also see forms such as olmair in the Old Boral period with the addition of suffix -air to denote a type of tree.

Use of the word as a demonym for Pentrose is in evidence from the nineteenth century (cf. the banner and nickname of the local lineball team) but likely predates it, given the historical prevalence of elm trees in the area.

Bosc d'ollem sarf a bog fair.
/bɔx dɔˈlɛm sarf a bɔj fer/

##

45.4: birgasq "apricot"

birgasq /bɪrˈgask/ [bɪːˈgask]
- apricot, pale orange-coloured fruit of a tree in the Prunus genus which spread throughout the Roman Empire by way of Armenia;
- a pale yellow-orange colour like that of the fruit;
- something or someone considered particularly admirable or coveted;
- a particularly contented or satisfied emotional state;

Etymology: from the Middle Boral period, a borrowing from northern Portingale o birgasque "the apricot", variant of earlier obirgoque apparently influenced by synonym damasco, literally "from Damascus". This in turn comes from Arabic الْبَرْقُوق (al-barqūq) "apricots, (later) plums", probably via the form albercoc in Barcelon.

Its figurative extension is in evidence from the eighteenth century, originally used to describe particularly attractive women; compare similar uses of various words for fruits in other languages.

Tu a birgasq oc aubon—te cay cal fallout?
/ti a bɪːˈgask ɔk oˈbɔn | te ke kal faˈlut/

45.5: Willemy

Willemy is a polity in northern Europe, situated east of Norman Kent and France.

History
The Duchy of Willemy was a minor polity within the German Empire during the Second Tetrarchy of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Forming much of the empire's border with the First Drengot Empire to the west, defence against the marksmen of Willemy led Drengot Emperor Roger II to spend greatly on castle fortifications from Flanders to the Alps.

The Great Flie Flood of 1171 swept away much of Lower Frisia in Willemy, creating several new islands in the Rustigh Strait (such as Texel) and killing then-ruler Lovis the Tall, who was in Amstel at the time. The devastation in the region is thought to have allowed Borlish Axbane to flourish as a trading post in the following century.

In the Revitalist Period and for some time afterwards, Willemy was split between neighbouring powers and portions of its territory changed hands regularly. The duchy of Avosche was unusually stable and held by France for over a century.

Trading operations from Willem and its cities in the Stadbund (the Bróderrat) contributed to staddomains in Atlantic Cappatia, most notably Neuwillem, whose Bróderratcronike (comprising a record of its activities from 1561 to 1597) is an important first-hand account of conditions in the region at the time.

Willem was the focal point of the seventeenth-century Blue Trans-Willem War, usually numbered among the Romantic Wars. This war led incidentally to the dissolution of the Kingdom of Burgundy and the creation of the Duchy of Far Suebia in Bavaria.

The two-arm system for sending steeplepost was first deployed in Willem in the early nineteenth century, to send the first lines of the Pater Noster from the church in the town of Thynen to neighbouring Bost. This event is likely what led to the name 'steeplepost' being applied to the technology.

The balcony ran around the entire first storey of the palace, and Matthias had been careful to note which corner faced the rugged uplands.

##

46.2: bro "dude"

bro /bro/ [bʀo]
- (vocative) dude, bro, mate, term of address for a (usually male) friend used generally in an admiring or appreciative context;
- macho, jocky, masculine (person), a person typified by the impression of physical strength and other male-associated characteristics

Etymology: often conflated with synonymous Willem broe or Merch brow /bru/ (both clippings of words for "brother") and likely influenced in usage by these, but thought to be otherwise unrelated. In the Middle Boral period we primarily see the spelling brau "hero, worthy man", suggesting a connection to braf "brave, heroic" from Italian via French.

Early and uncertain attestions of a word ?prau "poss. fighter, warrior" constitute an alternative etymology; this word may reflect the Latin adjective pravus "perverse, vicious", although the semantic connection is tenuous.

Nos aum issaur magn je ados, bro!
/nɔz om ɪˈsor mɛjn ʒe aˈdɔz | bro/

46.3: descorçar "peer"

descorçar /ˌde.xɔrˈtsar/ [ˌde.xʊːˈtsɑː]
- peer at, eye, to look at deliberately as if with difficulty or apprehension;
- inspect, scrutinise, to examine something with great care or detail;
- (rare, literally) peel, shell, to remove the bark or peel from the surface of a tree or plant

Etymology: originally in the last sense, either a native formation in the Middle Boral period from noun scorç "bark, peel" and prefix de- indicating reversal or movement away, or else a calque of Latin dēcorticō "I remove the bark or peel" formed in the same way.

Metaphorical use is seen almost immediately and by the eighteenth century the verb has almost entirely been supplanted in its literal sense by periphrastic construction scorç delir de "to remove bark/peel from".

Il ern l'imascry descorçant ag cogn jagerrem.
/ɪl ɛrn ˌli.maˈxri ˌde.xɔrˈtsant ɛj kɔjn ʒaˈgɛ.rɛm/

## 

46.4: gevou "watch out!"

gevou /geˈvu/ [gɪˈvu]
- (exclamation) watch out, beware, be careful, exhortation to remain safe by acting in a cautious manner;
- forewarning, heads-up, alert of upcoming danger given ahead of time;
- caveat, proviso, stumbling block, an exception or other awkward condition that is worth knowing about and may need working around

Etymology: first in exclamatory usage, borrowed in the seventeenth century from French phrase a gué vous "look out!" (later written together as gué-vous and used as an ordinary noun), literally "to (the) lookout, you!". The noun gué "watchman, vigil, lookout" descends from Old French, borrowed from the Frankish descendant of Classical German vactuō "watch, vigil".

The word's phonetic resemblance to the English word "careful" is coincidental.

Deð lour gevou cant y rafayat revin.

46.5: Channels

The Rustigh Strait (Borlish: Naur Rustig /nor rɪˈstaj/, Frisian Nao Rustig /nɑw ˈrʏ.stɪg/, literally "calm strait") is the channel of water separating the southern coast of Borland from the northern coasts of Flanders and Willemy.

The strait's position often gave it great strategic importance, in terms of both military and trade. For example, coastal cities on the strait like Axbane and Amstel [Amsterdam] were natural stopping points for ships trading between Dane lands to the east and the Welsh and Vascon trade meshes to the west.

During and following the Albic Wars of Fealty, British communities of immigrants spread along the cities on both sides of the Rustig, such as Pentrose.

An air-steeple connection was set up in the 1830s across the Rustig from Nausçod on Borland to Laicouche in French Guillenne (now Lagcóch), where the strait was less than seven leagues across. In 1854 this was superseded by the creation of an undersea barrick cable.

Methodics is the field of study pertaining to the discovery, development and improvement of methods. In this scholastic context a method is any series of instructions that may be unambiguously and repeatably followed to produce some result.

History
For millennia methods were developed sporadically without much awareness of general methodical principles. For example, an early method in the historical record is Euclid's procedure for finding the coarsest scale common to two whole numbers. Later we find methods involving tables of pre-computed values, such as Nadim's Method for multiplication by means of the Trapolitan identity for arrhumb [cosine].

Methods with more immediate practical use were continually developed; by the sixteenth century the threepoint method [triangulation] for calculating distances was vital in creating accurate maps for the explorations of the Intertwining Century.

One the first major results in abstract methodics came from the study of life, with Rachel Desselut's 1743 work Parable of the Mute Bookbinder, which argued that in order for living matter to duplicate, it must contain within itself an explicit method describing its construction. Although heredian acid [DNA] would not be discovered for another century, her work accurately predicted the necessary separation of Form and Method that would become the bedrock of the study of heredity.

An incresingly-important category of method from the eighteenth-century onward has been procedures for encrypting text, either to conceal it or else simply to convert it into a suitable form for a given steeplepost.

47.1: King James Stew

excerpt in translation from 1880 mealbook Pasti Mezziterreni, written by traveller Josforo Sant'Angelo.

Of all the fish stews I sampled along the solarium coasts of Barcelon and Provence (not to mention the singular mussel-olive dish I was served on the beaches of Mayurca), none compare to the King James.

Locally and affectionately called the jaumetia “little James”, this stew is named for James VI (1691-1749), the longest-ruling monarch in Barcelon since its establishment in 1067.

Degnant ig sceusn ragost comportant ny region pre sy regn, y majortað sarven for toð y mansc consumir oc remanent des y vanc d'un jorn.
Although similar stews existed in the region before his reign, most simply functioned to use up whatever seafood remained from a day’s catch.

47.2: un tarç dagr "neither fish nor fowl"

un tarç dagr /ɪn tarts dɛjr̩/ [ɪn ˈtɑːs ˈdɛjɐ]
- neither fish nor fowl, something or someone not easily categorised, not fitting into the established roles of a given situation;
- grey area, ambiguity, a situation intermediate between more familiar states that is not clear or where the rules are not known
- maverick, renegade, iconoclast, law unto oneself, a person refusing to be bound by societal conventions

Etymology: clipped form of earlier proverb no plom ben aur ja tarç dagr "neither lead nor gold but [a] secret third [thing]". This has itself been frozen in an archaic dialect due to its appearance in the evergreen plays of Kinollesau—in Modern Boral we might instead see necun plom ben aur, aglon un treyem scos.

The word tarç "third" descends directly from synonymous Latin tertius and now exists in complementary distribution with later derivation treyem < trēs "three". The disused adjective dagr "secret, hidden, unknown" comes via Old Boral daȝl, daȝr from Old English deagol "secret, obscure, dark".

L'eç aldr aun ja un tarç dagr me rent.
/lɛts aldr̩ on ʒa ɪn tarts dɛjr̩ me rɛnt/

47.3: haft "busy"

haft /haft/ [haft]
- busy, occupied, engaged in activity to a sufficient extent that one would have difficulty doing something else at the same time;
- in use, occupied, active, currently being used in a way that prevents others from using the same thing;
- full, booked out, having been reserved for use entirely so that there is no space for anyone new

Etymology: via Old Boral haft "seizure, capture, imprisonment", apparently a deverbal of an unattested *haftar which would reflect Old English hæftan "to seize, capture, imprison". Its use in apposition as an adjective is seen from the fourteenth century, originally in the sense "captive, unfree" and soon after in its modern senses.

Quisteu raut neðan y davarn sey haft.

pallort /paˈlɔrt/ [pɐˈlɔːt]
- mussel, any of several groups of bivalve shellfish with long asymmetric shells;
- halfwit, dullard, someone perceived to be lacking in intelligence

Etymology: from Old Boral palorde "clam, mussel", from synonymous Vulgar Latin *palorda, itself an alteration of Classical pelōris, pelōridem "large clam or mussel". The word has been used as an insult since at latest the sixteenth century.

Jo comprene noc sceye pallort ny farrago.

47.5: The Modest Arrangement

The Modest Arrangement was a social movement in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries characterised by more stringent enforcement of morality codes, especially with respect to familial powers.

The Arrangement saw a resurgence in the regions of Gaul and Spain in the early nineteenth century after something of an ebb during the Long Peace. This has been attributed to the rising popularity of the Deviance movement inspiring a backlash among its opposers; certainly Modest ideology depicts itself as less secure and more embattled in its later incarnations.

One of the most salient aspects of the Modest Arrangement from the modern perspective is its propensity to censorship, particularly of works deemed contrary to decency. Famously, author Antòin Herrel (latterly Tony Smith) was forced to flee Vascony to Kent after attempting to publish his blasphemous work 'Earthly Scene' (Vista Terrena).

The Second German War of the 1820s saw the grip of the Modest Arrangement weaken in many places, if only incidentally—as faith in existing power structures waned so too did people's trust in those powers' enforcement of the law. The days of Modest Vascony were numbered almost as soon as its interests in Mendeva and the East were threatened and the Vallabrì administration under King Hernand declared an alliance with the Convoy.

Although the Modest Arrangement would not survive the 1850 Laic Declarations in Belgrade in any official capacity, polities like Vascony, (New) Provence and Morrack would retain some hallmarks of the Arrangement well into the twentieth century.

- backup, reinforcements, relief force, additional troops or equipment sent to support a military action (also in metaphorical use)

Etymology: originally in the first sense only in Old Boral flotisc, deverbal noun from verb flotir "to float, to be still in the water", itself a borrowing likely from Old English flotian "to float".

Jo no poð lou affaçar pre vienn y flottisc.

pernix /pɛrˈnɪks/ [pɪːˈnɪks]
- nimble, dextrous, deft, agile, skillful with one's hands and able to make very precise movements;
- swift, fleet, rapid and graceful in motion;
- subtle, crafty, insidious, manipulative, being able to direct someone else's decisions without their knowledge

Etymology: learned borrowing in the Middle Boral period from Latin pernix "nimble, agile, swift", thought to be connected with perna "ham, haunch, gammon" (cf. inherited Boral parn "bacon"), although the expected Latin form would be *pernāx.

Its latter sense develops in the eighteenth century under the malign influence of unrelated perniçous "harmful, pernicious, deleterious", from synonymous Latin perniciōsus, a derivative of pernecō "I kill, slay, annihilate".

L'eye doutr y verroil ant deit pernix.

coðelostað "caution"

coðelostað /koˌðe.lɔˈstaθ/ [kʊˌðɛ.lʊˈstah]
- caution, wariness, vigilance, watchfulness, the state of begin alert to potential dangers or mistakes;
- anxiety, alarm, pessimism, an unpleasant condition of mental unease or concern about the uncertain future

Etymology: nominal derivative of coðelous "cautious, wary; attentive, aware" first attested in the fifteenth century. This adjective is itself a derivative of noun coðel "caution" (now obsolete, but compare French choile "lie, deceit" and various learned forms across Romance), from synonymous cautēla in Latin. Extension to more negative emotional states is seen from the eighteenth century.

Sy coðelostað er ençant a nos tardir.

sarzin "buckwheat"

sarzin /sarˈzɪn/ [sɐːˈzɪn]
- (obsolete) Muslim, Saracen, a person who is a follower of Islam;
- (archaic or dialect) non-Christian, pagan, practioner of a religion other than Christianity and especially one performing practices associated with pre-Christian peoples or peoples not yet exposed to Christianity;
- (historical) cairn, a conical heap of stones placed by the pre-Roman Kelt people around Borland or a modern such heap resembling these;
- (historical, by extension) milestone, a pillar or pile of stones placed at the side of a road to mark distance;
- buckwheat, an originally Asian plant whose fruit is widely used in cooking as a pseudocereal

Etymology: in its only surviving modern sense, a clipping of the earlier bla sarzin "Saracen wheat" which is first attested in the fifteenth century, in reference to its eastern origin (the plant having been brought to Europe via the Turkish Riyalid Sultanate or possibly via Russian Cazany).

Likewise, in the senses "cairn, milestone" it is a clipping of pieðr sarzin "Saracen stones", from the perception that these piles of stones were pre-Christian monuments to pagan gods.

The word itself is a borrowing from Old French sarrazin "Muslim, Saracen" reflecting Late Latin Saracēnus and Ancient Greek Σᾰρᾰκηνός (Sarakēnós). These originally referred to an Arabic or para-Arabic people of North Arabia.

Y cociner ença voug cas hojol ne sarzin.

excerpt from The Delicious Story of Dough and Oil, a work of popular history detailing the history of many related foods across the globe. Published (originally in Awrish as Tésta Olaivan Vláxerte "A World of Dough in Oil") in 1963 by first-time writer and famed chef Shomoji Taxon, who in his later years would go on to present the first cooking programme shown simultaneously on both sides of the Atlantic.

…see its eastern origins by its names in the languages of Europe—whether in Horther møurick ("Moorish wheat") or Bavarn creshke (originally from a Russian word meaning "Greek"). Nonetheless, sarzin [buckwheat] flour has since its introduction become a key component of diets across the continent.

We turn first to a dish which originated in Vallack communities and spread west upriver as the region was united politically under the Kingdom of the Danaw [Danube] during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Even after the kingdom's collapse and the rise of the Riverine Cities in the nineteenth century, farama dry-pottage has remained an important tradition from Pojon [Bratislava] to Gollamo [Ruse].

Farama seems originally to have been associated with wedding anniversaries, as an inexpensive (at least, before the recipe was augmented with unseasonal berries or spices like dallasine [cinnamon]) of celebrating each passing year. Over time the traditions around farama have shifted; in many places the sarzin dish is now served on birthdays.

Along with the area's distinctive hodgel-cakes [in this case, blini], farama enjoyed an explosion in popularity worldwide (usually divorced from its vicine traditions) after their prominent inclusion in the film…

gallaið "galaxy"

gallaið /gaˈleθ/ [gɐˈleh]
- galaxy, collection of stars all orbiting a common centre;
- seemingly-uncountable collection of people of things conceptualised as comprising a vast variety;
- (dated) the Milky Way, the galaxy in which the Sun and Earth are found and which is most readily visible in the night sky

Etymology: from late Old Boral galaix, galais "the Milky Way", learned borrowing from synonymous Latin galaxiās and Ancient Greek (κύκλος) γᾰλᾰξῐ́ᾱς, literally "milky circle". Altered in the early Middle Boral period under the influence of laið "milk", from Latin lac, lactem "milk" (or possibly from a Borland Kelt form; compare Cambrick łaeth "milk").

Used as a proper noun until the discovery of other galaxies in the Good Game period of the late nineteenth century. Metaphorical use for other vast collections of things is seen since the seventeenth century, especially in poetry.

- homeland, hometown, origins, the place where one was born or which one considers to be home;
- pedigree, ancestry, heritage, lineage, one's family background and the traditions and customs one has as a virtue of the place and people one was born to;

Etymology: via Old Boral orin, oriȝn "breeding, heritage" from Latin orīgō, orīginem "commencement, origination, (particularly) birth", from which also comes the later reborrowing origin "source, origin, beginning". Used metonymically to refer to the place of one's birth since the fourteenth century.

- weigh, to determine the weight of;
- weigh out, distribute, apportion, to divde into portions according to some criterion;
- consider, weigh up, assess, to deliberate on the relative importance of differnet factors

Etymology: from Old Boral pisar, pesar "to weigh, consider", the combination of the native descendant of Latin pēnsō "I ponder, purchase" (which also gives Modern Boral pesar "think") along with a secondary verbal derivation from noun pis "weight, measure", from Latin pēnsum "allotment, quota".

laundar "slip"

laundar /lonˈdar/ [lʊnˈdɑː]
- slip, skid, slide, glide, to move along a slippery surface without traction;
- trip, stumble, stagger, to walk clumsily so as to (almost) fall over;
- err, misspeak, misstep, to be mistaken about something;
- pass, elapse, (of time) to be spent, especially without one achieving anything of import

Etymology: from Old Boral laundar "slip, err", either from an unattested synonymous Latin verb *lābundō or a contemporary verbal derivation of laund "slippery, unsteady" (the modern launt "slip, misstep, faux pas" is likely a later deverbal from the Middle Boral period). In either case the word originates with Latin lābundus "slippery", participial form of deponent verb lābor "I slip, sink, vanish, err".

- handhold, foothold, handle, part of a surface which allows one to hold on so as not to be moved;
- help, assistance, encouragement, physical or emotional aid from somebody that enables one not to fail;
- mastery, understanding, competence, the state of having learnt everything about something so that one can act with confidence in that domain

Etymology: from Middle Boral garaf "grip, handle", a borrowing from Portingale garafa "handle", of indeterminate origin. Either an alteration of earlier grafio, garfio "hook", from Latin graphium "stylus, pen", or else borrowed from Andalus Arabic جَارْفَا‎ (gárfá) "handful, claw".

- till, cultivate, plough, to prepare (ground) for the growing of crops;
- process, render, work on, to apply a given process to;
- alter, synthesise, convert, to cause to undergo a process so as to turn a material into something else

Etymology: from Old Boral ploȝar "to till, plough" and now-obsolete noun plouȝ "plough", both originally in western dialects and borrowed from Old English plōg "land for ploughing, (later) plough". In its latter senses it is a metaphorical extension from the agricultural use, seen from the fifteenth century.

epu "express"

epu /eˈpi/ [ɪˈpi]
- (of a shop or similar) express, mini, providing a more limited but more focused service than usual;
- cheap, good value, having a gratifyingly low price for the level of quality offered;
- bitesize, mini, having been stripped down in complexity and/or size for easier immediate consumption;

Etymology: modern borrowing from French épu "express, direct, unhindered, available, at hand", first seen in Boral in the names of imported shopfronts such as Panier, whose Panier Épu establishments were much smaller but offered better deals than the main line.

Cognate with Boral speut "free, unfettered, clear", the word épu reflects Old French espeü, past participle of moribund verb espeïr "to free, untangle, prepare". from Latin expediō "I remove the shackles of, I carry out, I am profitable".

- announce, publicise, to give public notice usually for the first time;
- express, say, convey, to communicate so as to make something explicit;

Etymology: originally in the first senses and later weakened substantially, from Old Boral isvelar "to unveil, reveal", derivative of velar "to veil, shroud" < Latin vēlō with the prefix is- "out, away, un-" < Latin ex- "out, throughout".

- thrust, lunge, push, to make an advance with force and especially while wielding a melee weapon;
- advance, assault, to move forward as part of a military operation;
- lobby, campaign, to push for a particular policy proposal

Etymology: verbal derivative from stoccad "a lunge, thrust" either in Middle Boral or in the synonymous French estoccade, estoccader before their adoption into Boral. In either case the noun comes from Italian stoccato "thrust", past participle of stoccar "to thrust (with a sword)", itself from now-obsolete stocco "rapier, shortsword". This noun, which is a borrowing from Dutch stooken "to poke, stab", is reflected in Boral stoc "truncheon, club".

- (archaic or humorous) involve, embroil, drag in, to cause to be overly involved in;
- brush off, disregard, dismiss, to pay no attention to;
- (colloquially) vacuum, hoover, to suck up dust or similar detritus using a machine to create negative pressure

Etymology: verbal derivation of jannest "broom, cleaning brush", from Old Boral janeste, geneste "broom, broom shrub" (the former originally from northern dialect), from Latin genesta "broom shrub". The noun jannest has been supplanted in its botanical sense by originally-Kelt banag "broom shrub" (see also Norman balay, Cambrick banadyl). In the last sense, attested since 1941.

javigar "trawl"

javigar /ˌʒa.viˈgar/ [ˌʝa.vɪˈgɑː]
- trawl, to fish from a slow-moving vessel using a trawlnet;
- (by extension) sweep, scour, ransack, comb through, to make an exhaustive and methodical search over a defined area or down an explicit list of options;
- search, query, index, locate, to perform a search of a information organisation system (e.g. in a library) or, later, of a database or of webpages using a computer

Etymology: originally in the first sense, borrowed along with the noun javig "trawlnet; later, (a) methodical search" from synonymous Portingale xaviga in the thirteenth century; the initial voicing is unexplained and has been attributed to dialect variation. The Portingale word is a borrowing from Arabic شَبَكَة (shabaca) "fishing net", likely via Mostara Spanish.

- misery, woe, distress, wretchedness, a state of great unhappiness characterised by physical or mental affliction;
- ruin, decrepitude, disrepair, the condition of being utterly worn out or destroyed from long use or disuse;
- (archaic or legal) bankruptcy, insolvency, inability to meet one's financial obligations

Etymology: Middle Boral-era nominalisation of now-obsolete vabian "woeful, disconsolate", coming via synonymous Old Boral vabȝan from Old English from Old English wābegān, literally "beset by woe". In the last sense it is attested generally from the fourteenth century until the eighteenth, and in specialised use thereafter.

- forth, forward, ahead, in the direction of increasing time or degree or out from a particular place;
- henceforth, going forward, in future, from now on, at all times after the present;
- onward, continually, going on without pause or hesitation;

Etymology: adverbial derivation from prepostion posc "after, since" < Late  Latin posque < post quem "after which". This word was originally  restricted to taking complements "after I get back" rather than nominal arguments "after the wedding", for which one would use now-obsolete pos < Latin post "after, behind"; the former had displaced the latter by  the fifteenth century.

- camp, campsite, an outdoor place acting as a temporary accommodation either in tents or entirely outdoors;
- improvisation, kludge, stopgap, patch, a temporary set-up formed by convenience or due to time constraints that one intends to replace with something more permanent

Etymology: from Old Boral bavȝl (probably /bawʎ/) "tent, campsite", cognate with Cambrick pabell "tent" in coming via a Kelt form (the Borland reflex exhibiting characteristic initial voicing) from Latin pāpiliō "butterfly, (later) tent". In the latter sense the word is seen from the sixteenth century, originally with reference to a room's hasty arrangement of appliances/furniture or similar processes that resemble the ad-hoc set-up of a campsite.

opening of an 1813 letter sent by Dorothe Shock, proprietress of Miszen [1] emporium De Marnoshring, to her mother Johanne in her home village of Siorow. This missive is taken from the collected correspondence kept in trust at the Marnosh Gravatory [archives], the enterprise having grown dramatically from a single shop selling trinkets to a quasipolitic guild [multinational corporation] controlling much of the market for children's toys and various material hobbies. 

My dearest mother,

First I must reassure you that [her brother] young Crazi has arrived in Miszen safe and in good spirits. He has not taken to commerce as enthusiastically as you had hoped (or at least not as well as he has taken to nights out with soldierly friends and woodheaded mornings!) but his allegedly-charming features seem to have contributed to a string of advantageous deals with the usual suppliers.

You shall I expect be unsurprised to hear that the Potchware [2] woodcarvings refuse to be bought at even half the cost of importing them (never mind Hamburg's stanglehold on the Elbe); eventually I managed to convince a particuarly-credulous customer from Crovatia that they were the only attested artworks of a remote people of Chrysia, which limited our losses to an acceptable amount.

The mayor continues to promise better roads out west to Lepzi—it is nonsensical that one cannot make the journey in a day and must suffer an uncomfortable night in the only Ossatz lodginghouse with tolerable chambermaids. I cannot see that such projects will find funds for themselves so long as the garrison demands its gold, and so long as the Boheme menace rattles its sabre across the southern…

alcheðr /alˈke.ðr̩/ [ɐˈgɛ.ðɐ]
- once more, anew, afresh, occurring again after a period of absence or otherwise with a definite break from the past;
- (obsolete) twice, occuring two times

Etymology: Middle Boral extension of now-obsolete eðr "again, twice, repeatedly" after various function words like alcant "once", alcun "none" and alcot "how much". The element alc- descends from Latin determiner aliquī "some, any", while the adverb eðr is either a direct reflection of Latin iterum "again, a second time" or a deverbal of eðrar "to repeat", from related Latin iterō "I repeat, I do again".

ðescar /ðɛˈxar/ [ðɪˈxɑː]
- feed, nourish, to supply with food;
- fuel, kindle, to supply with fuel so as to keep a fire burning or a machine operating;
- stir up, inflame, aggravate, arouse, to exacerbate a (bad) situation

Etymology: from Old Boral ðescar "to feed, fatten up", inherited directly from synonymous Insular Latin adēscō (in more productive use than in Classical Latin). This is a derivative of noun ēsca "food, fodder, bait, fuel", from which we also have modern Boral esc "bait, lure". Extension from food to fuel and then to metaphorical use is attested early, from the twelfth century.

Faç le noc gavir neðan sy soir ðescar.
/fats le nɔk gaˈvɪr neˈðan si sɔjr ðɛˈxar/

quondar "lurk"

quondar /kwɔnˈdar/ [kwʊnˈdɑː]
- lie in wait, lurk, to hide while waiting to ambush or simply accost someone;
- be on the lookout, keep watch, to remain fully aware of one's surrounding in waiting for something particular to happen;
- lurk, loiter, hang out, to wait around a location without drawing attention to oneself

Etymology: from Old Boral quondar, covondar, acquondar et al. "lie in wait, prepare to ambush", appearing to reflect an unattested Vulgar Latin verb *accupābundō from *accupābundus "lurking, hiding, watching animals". This is a confused form influenced by the verbs aucupor "I catch birds or bees" and occupō "I occupy, seize, anticipate" (compare Cambrick achup "save, rescue").

Nos som quondant ag loub cant i se caf tos.

excerpt in translation from the diaries of Nadàlla fi Carol, who grew up in sixteenth-century Santrafew in the early days of New Provence.

There has been yet another argument with Dembro and his masons over the reconstruction of the nave after one of the buttresses failed last year.

The temporary pine roofing has been rather noticeable, and Father's talks with Dembro have led him to believe the simplest thing would be to take down some of the stonework from the surviving side and give the nave a fully wooden roof.

cingr "hail"

cingr /ˈtsɪn.gr̩/ [ˈtsɪŋ.gɐ]
- hail, the phenomenon of precipitation in the form of frozen raindrops;
- hailstone, any single particle of this precipitation;
- (by extension) ball bearing, a small metal sphere used in mechanical components or (commonly) any similar-looking ball;

Etymology: from the late Old Boral period originally restricted to naval usage, from Vask chingor "hail, hailstones". In the last sense it is a clipping of cingr acier "steel hailstone", apparently a direct calque from Cambrick deurkeseir "ball bearing".

Jo vusca caldour de souscen neðan cous cingr.

livað "weary"

livað /liˈvaθ/ [lɪˈvah]
- weather-beaten, scuffed, having a damaged or discoloured surface due to exposure to the elements;
- weary, frustrated, fed up, having one's reserves of patience or contentment entirely exhausted

Etymology: past participle of livar "tan, darken, make leather from rawhide", itself a verbal derivation from noun lif "tan, oak bark or similar compound using in tanning leather". This reflects either an unattested Latinate derivative of līveō "I am bruised" or a Kelt form cognate with Cambrick łiw "dye, paint".

Sco livað den!

- (specifically) text, telegram, fax, to send a message in text form via a long-distance network;
- (proscribed) call, ring, telephone, to get in touch with someone by telephone or similar voice-based system

Etymology: from Old Boral, a verbal derivative of bouð (also boðour) "messenger, courier" (modern "signal, message"), which is borrowed from Old English boda "messenger".

Bouð y viker ða i no's ac yent pre haçol.

taus /toz/ [toz]
- rate, speed, the rapidity at which some process takes place;
- value, worth, the quality which renders someone or something desirable or valuable;
- (rare) price, cost, the monetary quantity needed to pruchase an item

Etymology: from Old Boral taus "tax, price", deverbal of taussar "to impose a tax on" borrowed from Old French and reflecting Latin taxō "I handle, charge, appraise, reckon" (compare modern French taux "level, amount, quantity" with an etymological respelling).

Taus gran alcot es y molin rouð faint la?

excerpt from the introduction of Modern Developments in Benjamine Detaxion [Aromatic Synthesis], a 1942 quire written by alchemist Ferris Bewly through the Conster Health Edifice and intended to provide a reference on the recent synthesis of various new substances and medicines around the world.

The sterling example is undoubtedly cozebdo-diamaschal benjamine (CD) [1], sold under various names and perhaps most familiar to Markland as the coveted 'Tommy pills', is a product of collaboration between the Branwen Sanatory in New Leudong and the University of Rimack in Tavancy [2] to find hebetants with faster action and fewer adversions.

Comprising (as the longform name implies) branches of cozebdone oil and maschal [3] in opposed position, the substance was first synthesised in 1932 and has already surpassed salix-derivative pills [4] in annual sales everywhere from Sangathy to Adighe [5]. This is due to the former's greater efficacy in relieving pain, which finds it more widely used than the previous bevy of remedies which may merely help to reduce symptoms of fever.

In sufficiently high concentrations CD has also been demonstrated to function in unguento, although the inefficiency and commodity of this…

psolic "deoxygenated"

psolic /psoˈlɪk/ [psʊˈlɪk]
- deoxygenated, of lower oxidation number, containing a smaller proportion of oxygen in its chemical composition;
- pertaining to the process of incomplete combustion, whereby a fuel burns in the presence of insufficient oxygen

Etymology: originally in the latter sense to denote combustion products such as carbon monoxide (in-universe, psolick aphlox), coined by Kievan alchemist Sogut Ranhalov in 1765 and derived from Ancient Greek ψόλος (psólos) "soot, smoke".

Con tersur psolic poð l'yeustanç de vin lejar.

bos "gun"

bos /bɔz/ [bɔz]
- gun, firearm, a handheld device for projecting a hard object very quickly as a ranged weapon;
- (specifically) rifle, shotgun, musket, a less portable long-barrelled gun and especially in reference to historical firearms;
- (by extension) any handheld device which is activated by a trigger and shoots or sprays objects or substances from a tube

Etymology: clipping of armbos, arm bos "boss weapon", folk-etymological borrowing (after arm "weapon") from Dutch armbósz "gun, (originally) crossbow". This is itself adapated from earlier forms such as arbalst under the influence of arm "arm (limb)", and these forms reflect Medieval Latin arbalista "crossbow".

Jo montau ag tabr e clignau my bos yert a haut.

quottar "fit into"

quottar /kwɔˈtar/ [kwʊˈtɑː]
- fit into, to be small enough in some dimension to be placed in some location;
- (slang) pull off, suit, to love good wearing some article of clothing or (by extension) to succeed well in any particular situation;
- be affordable, to cost little enough that one has enough money to spend on it;
- (mathematics) divide, to be an exact divisor of some number, as 4 is to 28;

Etymology: originally in the third sense, borrowed in the Middle Boral period from Italian quottare "to be accounted for (in a budget); of a transaction, to succeed" presumably via some financial or trade connection. The Italian is a derivative of Latin quot "how much"—compare the synonymous descendant alcot in Boral. Generalisation to the first sense occurs from the seventeenth century (and partially displaces existing entrar "go in"); in mathematics it is seen in 1834; the slang sense seems to date back only to the 1980s.

Fort alcot i quotta y jacquot me souprene.

By the time we do have evidence of manoscard melody in contemporary popular music, we see use of the scale across western Europe as far north as Mondwell [Anglesey] and as far south as Bagliemmo [Palermo], so it is difficult to determine its true homeland.

hellinar "plug"

hellinar /ˌhɛ.liˈnar/ [ˌhɛ.lɪˈnɑː]
- plug, bung, stop, to block an opening with an object making it tightly sealed;
- cope, deal, to manage a (usually difficult) situation effectively

Etymology: verbal derivation from hellin "cork; plug, bung", itself borrowed from Vascon or Leon hellino "cork (substance); bottle stopper". This is a sufficiently-early loan from Arabic فَلِّين <fallīn> "cork" that it exhibits the f > h sound shift characteristic of northern Spanish languages.

Jo's eut may hellinar a tu pos figurar.

benjamin "perfume"

benjamin /ˌbɛn.ʒaˈmɪn/ [ˌbɛɲ.ʝɐˈmɪn]
- (archaic) benzoin, a dry resin prepared from a Javanese tree having a fragrant odour;
- frankincense, an aromatic resin from a genus of flowering plants native to the Arabian peninsula and the Horn of Africa;
- (by extension) perfume, incense, any substance created in order to emit or convey a pleasant smell;
- (chemistry) aromatic compound, a molecule containing at least benzene ring

Etymology: from the late fifteenth century and originally in the first sense, borrowed from Vascon benjamin "benzoin, frankincense". This is a folk-etymological corruption of earlier benjavin, lo benjavi, itself a reanalysis of Arabic لُبَان جَاوِيّ‎ (lubān jāwiyy), literally "Javanese frankincense". As a general term for perfumes it is seen since the eighteenth century; in chemistry the jargon use is borrowed from the Cambrick practice in the early twentieth century.

- screenshot, an image of how (part of) some interactive screen appeared at a particular moment;
- theme, thread, throughline, a recurring element in an artistic work

Etymology: from Old Boral panel "swatch of fabric, rectangle of wood", descending via a Vulgar Latin diminutive from Latin pannus "cloth, rag".

çarvinot /ˌtsar.viˈnɔt/ [ˌtsɑː.viˈnɔt]
- raspberry, the plant Rubus idaeus or the red fruit thereof;
- purple-red, the colour of the ripe fruit

Etymology; further diminutive of obsolete çarvin, cervin, itself abbreviated from Old Boral baȝ cervin "raspberry, lit. fawn berry". The Old Boral cervin "fawn, young deer" is a derivative of çarf "deer", from synonymous cervus in Latin.

excerpt from Lux Æterna: The First Century of Threshold Force, written in 2002 (at the time in Dutch with the title Onslackbar Vláy: Drampelstøweth tÿdes har Rést Éw "Unquenchable Fire: Threshold Force in its First Century") by Cawen ba Dirxen at the Varonøw Higher Edifice. This documentarian book was commissioned to commemorate the centenary of the discovery of the atomic nux [nucleus] in the city's Nÿstad Atellier (then privately owned and run by substantial theorist Lohic Courvoisier de Nÿstad).

…has since 1996 produced more killdark [uranium]—predominantly processed immediately into tarmarette [yellowcake] form—than the combined output of all Chrysia [Australia].

Hints at the discrete nature of the composition of atoms (a phrase which itself would not have sat well with either side of the Atomicity Rift; atomicists were yet wedded to the intrinsic Leucippic model, while their opposition regarded the entire scheme as a merely useful fiction) had been encroaching into the understanding of matter for decades. Since the first corporal enumerations [periodic tables] in the 1840s it had been realised that naïvely ordering corporals by weight led to inelegant groupings when alchemical properties were taken into account (most notably the strong motivation to place janthine [iodine] among its detaxional brethren like muria [chlorine]), and no theoretical basis for these transpositions would be proposed for decades.

At the same time, the apparently-unrelated phenomenon where the lightest corporals had all been measured to have weights almost exact multiples of that of aquifex [hydrogen], while this was not true at all of heavier ones (even such prosaic substances as copper!), demanded explanation. In 1881—a dozen years before the invention of a device that could even test her theory—Kievan theorist Nike Sarantylack proposed to resolve both questions at once. Her "mulberry" model (so-called by her detractors) supposed each atom to comprise a number of each of two different…

ubictað "ubiquity"

ubictað /ˌi.bɪkˈtaθ/ [ˌi.bɪkˈtah]
- ubiquity, omnipresence, the quality of being everywhere;
- totalism, universalism, ideology characterised by the application of principles uniformly in all contexts;
- Ubiquity, a particular ideology which rose to prominence in the late nineteenth century and defined one pole of global power through the twentieth

Etymology: late medieval borrowing from non-classical Latin ubīquitās "ubiquity", nominal derivation of ubīque "everywhere". Applied in philosophical contexts throughout the Latinate Vetomund from the sixteenth century, and used in particular for Ubiquity (originally as an insult) in 1848, in the translation of lady explorer Poshack Nerwaman's dismissive critique of political developments in Mashick [*Mexico].

53.2: quesq "damson"

quesq /kwɛsk/ [kwɛsk]
- damson, a subspecies of plum tree with sweeter and slightly ovoid fruits;
- damson, the fruit of this tree;
- deep purple, plum, aubergine, the colour of the damson fruit;
- cream of the crop, pick of the litter, the choice or most desirable part of something

Etymology: from Middle Boral (prun) quesq "damson (plum)", borrowed from Dutch dialectal queske, queshken "damson". This is a variant of synonymous standard Saxon tweshge and Bavarn zweschen, both borrowed from Vulgar Latin davascena "damascene plum" (cf. Classical damascēnum).

In metaphorical use a clipping of phrase quesq a tort "damson in the pie", attested from the seventeenth century.

- cyanide, a compound containing a -C≡N group or the CN⁻ anion;
- (specifically) hydrogen cyanide, a colourless and very poisonous liquid;

(not to be confused with sandrin "vitamin C, ascorbic acid".)

Etymology: adjectival derivation from mandr "almond" (from the presence of cyanide in almonds) first used in expressions like mandrin a lix "potassium cyanide" in the eighteenth century.

Tag enverimmað con mandrin occeyeu ty quanga.

- discontent, disgruntlement, dissatisfaction, resentment, feelings of unhappiness with the status quo;
- resistance, rebellion, uprising, revolt, organisation struggling for liberation against an authority seen as illegitimate (especially when underground or otherwise cloak-and-dagger)

Etymology: from Middle Boral aversion "opposition, resistance", seemingly the confluence of the two Latin roots āvertō "I turn away, repulse" and non-classical advertō "I oppose, fight against" (a backformation from adversārius "opponent"). In the last sense used especially for Collusion-supported movements through the twentieth century in regions dominated by Ubiquitous administration.

53.5: Brasil

Brasil is an island in the North Atlantic off the eastern coast of Mendeva. In the Novomund it was both the first location to be temporarily settled by people from the Vetomund and also the inception of sustained contact following the Landfall of 1471.

Unlike the name Mendeva, it is not known when the name Brasil was first used for this land. What is understood is that it was inspired by the Irish myth of Oil Breasail, a landmass west of Ireland that was said to be shrouded in mist except for one day every seven years. Islands labelled Brasil or similar wordforms appear sporadically on late-medieval maps of the Atlantic coast, usually much smaller and further east than the real place.

The Princess Alexandra of Vascony (sister of Ambrose the Ascendant) was the first Vetomundine royal to set foot in the Novomund, landing in Brasil in 1477.

By the mid-20th century Brasil had been fully incorporated as a region of Ambrosia, retaining only a few vestiges of local political independence. In 1950 the Brasil town of Paratzon formed one end of a new Atlantic link between Ambrosia and Morrack.

souseïr /ˌsu.ziˈjɪr/ [ˌsu.zɪˈjɪː]
- set aside, put away, to place something out of the way so that it can be used later;
- ground, run aground, to steer into too-shallow waters and get stuck there;
- settle, resolve, to deal conclusively with a problem;
- outclass, wipe the floor with, to surpass in a contest decisively

Etymology: from Middle Boral, a borrowing from Latin subsīdō "I crouch, subside" modelled on other verbs in -seïr like asseïr "dwell" and posseïr "own". First attested in the latter two senses in the seventeenth century, in early use seen particularly in the context of diplomatic disputes.

54.3: hoissar "whistle"

hoissar /hɔjˈsar/ [hʊjˈsɑː]
- whistle, to make a sound by forcing air through one's mouth;
- blow, to make music with a wind instrument or noise with a whistling device;
- disobey, flout, to express contempt for rules or laws by word or action;
- skive, skip, shirk, to renouce one's responsibilities especially with regards to school or work

Etymology: from Middle Boral hoisçar "whistle, flout", probably of onomatopoeic origin. Otherwise, perhaps a borrowing from Old English hwistlian "to whistle". Its subsequent semantic development is unclear but mirrored in e.g. Dutch fluiten "to play the flute, to scorn, to scoff".

54.4: trencaç "sharp"

trencaç /trɛnˈkats/ [tʀɪŋˈkas]
- sharp, having an edge which can cut very easily;
- freezing, (of weather) bitterly cold;
- wry, sarcastic, ironic, humorous in a particularly self-aware or deprecating way

Etymology: adjectival derivation from trencar "cut, slice", of uncertain origin. Perhaps from Vulgar Latin *trinicō "I cut in three"; otherwise likely an alteration of Latin truncō "I maim, dismember" under Kelt influence.

Caye trencaç yon jo venoy primer n'Ausbagn.

54.5: Medieval Mathematics

Nadim of Trapoles (fl. c12) was a mathematician at the Observatory in Trapoles, which at the time was a major Middlesea port for the Single Caliphate during the Second Tetrarchy. He is remembered for formulating the Trapolitan identity

which allows one to multiply two quantities using only addition, subtraction and enumerations of arrhumb [cosine tables].

---

Jambor of Hungary (fl. c12) was an early king of Hungary following the state's succession from the principality the century before. He oversaw significant expansion of Awrish influence, entering into personal union with eastern principalities such as Halich and Vallack, and becoming an ally of the Malchassian Romans to the south.

The great Library of Sobjan was built during his reign, an enduring gravatory of contemporary works. These included mathematical texts from the Single Caliphate which were at that time being translated into Latin in great quantities.

---

Saint Marinus (Italian: San Marino) is a historical city in the Italian state of Lombardy. It is recognised for the renowned Autonome University, which having been founded in the eleventh century is one of the oldest still-running educational establishments in the world, and especially for its Sovereign Library on the slopes of Titan.

Scholars of the Autonome University were among the first to translate many mathematical texts from Arabic into Latin; for instance, they compiled a liber numerorum in 1216 N which (surviving in a copy at the Library of Sobjan) contains the earliest-known enumeration of arrumb values in Europe.

55.2: cuidar "think"

cuidar /kajˈdar/ [kɐjˈdɑː]
- think, cogitate, ponder, to consider something carefully;
- think, believe, suppose, to have an opinion about something;
- propose, intend, mean, have in mind, to fix one's mind upon something

Etymology: from Old Boral, borrowed from Old French cuidier "to consider, presume, think", which reflects the synoymous cōgitō in Latin. Displaced always-rare coiðar "to think" from the same source.

55.3: pluottar "fledge"

pluottar /ˌpli.ɔˈtar/ [ˌpli.jʊˈtɑː]
- fledge, (of a young bird) to grow feathers and thus be able to fly from the nest;
- metamorphose, (of an insect) to mature from a larval stage into a mature adult insect;
- mature, grow up, come of age, to age from a child to an adult (or metaphorically to do so in terms of emotional maturity);
- to gain experience in a given field, to attain mastery of some skill

Etymology: originally only in the first sense, a verbal derivative from Old Boral pluot, pluvot "down feathers, (later) beard stubble". This is a diminutive (possibly via a Kelt form) of plum "feather", from the synonymous plūma in Latin.

Jo le stim magn pluottað cos nuvr.

Etymology: from Old Boral vitaȝl "provisions", a borrowing from synonymous Old French vitaile, itself descended from Latin vīctuālia "nutritional things". This is a derivative of vīctus "living, diet", from vīvō "I live".

55.5: Portingale

Portingale is a polity in the western part of the Spanish peninsula, bordering Vascony and Andalus, both of which have in the past conquered parts of its territory.

History
Portingale had been established as an independent Christian kingdom in the eleventh century, having previously been a subordinate county in Leon.

Much of northern Portingale was conquered by Vascony during the Vascon Ascendancy under Ambrose III, as far south as Braga and (nominally) Calès. The wealth that came to Vascony in the decades after the Novomundine Landfall of 1471 N accrued in particular to the coastal towns of conquered Portingale and to Leon.

The rump Portingale in the south (which had retained some meagre autonomy under Vascon stewardship) fell to Morrack in 1457 N as part of the expansionist campaigns of King Munir al-Hamdawi.

With its population concentrated along the coast, Portingale was ravaged early and mercilessly by the Second Great Dying in the years following the plague's arrival in Europe in 1519 N, with one fifth of the population dying within the decade.

After a series of military defeats during the Romantic Wars of the mid-seventeenth century, Vascony was forced to cede its Portingale territory (its economic heartland) to Andalus.

Portingale at first attempted to remain neutral during the Democratic Wars of the eighteenth century, and as such received a great number of war refugees in this period. However, the All-Saints' earthquake of 1755 N severely weakened Portingale's position; as such its warring neighbours invaded Portingale soon after.

The Drengot Collusion eventually grew to count Portingale within its orbit during the first decades of the twentieth century (and perhaps held some responsibility for the Portingale Anarchy of the 1920s and 30s), although the polity was never a full member of the alliance-federacy. This led to diplomatic tensions with Vascony, located directly between the Collusion and Portingale.

For a time, Drengot astraphor supplied (via undersea powerline) much of the baric needs of Portingale, thus relying on Vascon goodwill not to interfere. In response to this precarity, in the 1950s and 60s Portingale became a pioneer of threshold force, building enough mills that by 1970 it was exporting astraphor as far afield as Lombardy.

56.2: corrogar "build infrastructure"

corrogar /ˌko.roˈgar/ [ko.ʀʊˈgɑː]
- build infrastructure, develop, to undertake public development by providing somewhere with (say) transport links and utilities like water and electricity

Etymology: Backformation from noun corrogation "infrastructure, public works", from synonymous corrogātiō in Scholastic Latin. This comes from Medieval Latin corrogāta "corvée, collective labour provided by demand", itself probably formed by ellipsis of a Late Latin phrase opera corrogāta "invited work", from corrogō "I bring together by request, I invite".

- splendour, grandeur, magnificence of appearance;
- refinement, elegance, gentility, sophistication, an esteemed manner associated with those of status;
- finery, regalia, bling, decoration or ornamentation especially of clothing

Etymology: noun derivative of reloð "fine, fancy, refined", which descends uncomplicatedly via Old Boral from Vulgar Latin relautus "elegant, splendid, fashionable". This is a variant of synonymous lautus, which is an adjectival derivative of lavō "I wash, clean".

Y reloðeç ag tarner sta aplattiscent.
/i ˌre.loˈðɛts ɛj tarˈnɛr sta aˌpla.tiˈxɛnt/

- deadline, cutoff, the last moment in time when something is possible;

Etymology: originally in the second sense, an Old Boral deverbal noun from verb lejar "stop moving, crash, come to a halt". This descends from Insular Latin laedicō, a regularisation of Classical laedō "I strike, collide, hurt".

56.5: Vascony

Vascony (Vascon: Vasconna), or more fully the Vascon Kingdom of Navarre and Aquitain (Vascon: Lo Reiame Vascòn a Navarr'i Aquitanna, Vask: Navarron t'Aquitainon Vasca Herria) is a polity of western Europe occupying parts of southern Gaul and northern Spain.

History
Vascony was formed from the political union of Aquitain and Navarre, later expanding to vassalise Leon in the twelfth century.

The fifteenth century saw the Vascon Ascendancy, which began by most accounts in the reign of Ambrose II and reached a peak with his grandson Ambrose III. At the start of this period Vascony was at its territorial maximum: it had conquered northern Portingale and subjugated the rest as a nominally-independent client, as well as much of southern Burgundy (which is to say, enough of Provence to share a border with the Italian states of Jeans and Lombardy).

In 1458 Ambrose III established by royal decree the New Navarre Enterprise, whose primary aim was to solidify Vascon supremacy in the trade of North Atlantic fish through the Middlesea. British dominion over the Atlantic had long frustrated Vask fishing families, members of which still predominated in the aristocracy. It was ships of this guild that in 1471 sighted Brasil and brought news of the Novomund to Europe.

The decades following the Novomundine Landfall brought new prosperity to Vascony, and in particular to Portingale. At the same time, the polity suffered militarily: the Kingdom of Burgundy retook Provence in 1494 (sparking the 1497–99 War of Provincial Independence), and a decade later the remainder of Vascony's Middlesea coast (primarily the region of Tolose) was taken by Barcelon.

Being a maritime power, Vascony had explored parts of the African coast (as far south as Sant Adrian [Bioko]) during the fifteenth century. However, for much the same reason Vascony lost over a fifth of its population to the Second Great Dying in the years after the plague's arrival in Europe in 1519. Despite this, thanks to Novomundine profits in furs and other goods, the polity actually saw in increase in population from 1500 to 1550 (excluding Portingale) due to immigration.

The Vascon Ascendancy is generally considered to have ended with the War of the Two Queens near the end of the sixteenth century, which also saw the formal end of feudalism within the polity.

The parts of Mendeva first explored by (and whose trade was monopolised by) Vascony—to wit, the island of Brasil and the lands westward thereof—was named Ambrosia in honour of Ambrose III.

During the Romantic Wars of the mid-seventeenth century, Vascony fought primarily with Morrack to the south. The polity was forced to cede Portingale, its economic heart, to Andalus (then controlled by Morrack) after a series of military defeats.

In an example of early international cooperation, a canal system connecting Bordew to Audaz in Barcelon was completed in 1679.

Vascony was at the vanguard of the Modest Arrangement, a social movement in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries characterised by more stringent enforcement of morality codes, especially with respect to familial powers. Famously, author Antòin Herrel (latterly Tony Smith) was forced to flee Vascony to Kent after attempting to publish his blasphemous work 'Earthly Scene' (Vista Terrena).

At first, Vascony managed not to become embroiled in the Second German War of the 1820s. Once its interests in Mendeva and the East were threatened, however, then-king Hernand IV had no choice but to declare against the Northern Concert and in favour of the Convoy.

Into the twentieth century, Vascony maintained strong ties with its neighbour Provence by virtue of a shared enmity towards the Drengot Collusion to their north.

Efforts to trace the source of the contamination are as yet inconclusive, though the lack of any similar cases reported in the rest of Libya (from where Borland imports the majority of these alchemical products for detaxion)'s export market suggests that the issue may lie with the refining mills at Haldanvion.

57.5: Damvath

Damvath is the capital city of Borland, located on the River Dam some leagues inland from the coast.

Toponymy
The name Damvath derives from the Norse name Damvað "ford on the Dam". The river's name is pre-Roman and is likely cognate with the Tames in Albion and the Tanga in Portingale.

History
Damvath was established first as the capital of Dane-ruled Borland after the exile of King Jothey to Sothbar in the last years of the ninth century.

In the late fifteenth century, Damvath became the most-trafficked port city in Europe outside the Middlesea. This was no doubt helped by the city's stability in comparison to the cities of contemporary Albion, embroiled in the bloody Wars of Fealty.

14th Sep: Arrived at Brest. Storm inland delayed delivery of beef so departed several hours behind schedule.
18th Sep: Did not make port at Bournemouth. Cannonfire and conflagration even in the harbour. Will resupply instead at Honeflower.
— logbook 1492 for the myton “San Tomé”, en route from Calès to Damvath.

The first Borlish victim of the Second Great Dying was in the docks of Damvath in 1519.

During the Long Peace of the late eighteenth century, the location of the Borlish parliament was fixed following the completion of the Jacobin Estates on the (then) outskirts of Damvath. In these years the city saw increased immigration from nearby polities such as Denmark and Willemy, looking for greater economic prosperity, as well as the establishment of an early detective force with the so-called 'tuppence scouts'.

In the modern era Damvath is renowned for extensive Christide celebrations.

- split, split open, dehisce, separate, to break apart (especially along a seam) and fall into two halves;
- gape, yawn, to open wide;
- burst, rupture, to come apart (often violently) due to internal pressure;
- fall apart, collapse, topple, to lose structural integrity and fall to pieces;
- (figuratively) fall apart, unravel, break down, go to pieces, to suddenly lose all hope for success (especially of plans)

Etymology: Middle Boral borrowing from Latin dehīscō "I gape, yawn, split open", used primarily in botanical contexts as of blossoms or fruits. Ending in -ir modelled after other change-of-state verbs like finir, jo finisc "to finish, I finish". In figurative use it may have been facilitated by the pre-existing metaphor of the flower as a work or achievement.

Nos se ponau voud a sy vellisqment dehiscn.

58.4: zi "yeah"

zi /zi/ [zi]
- yeah, sure, yep, mhm, informal form of oc or ja "yes" used to denote agreement or assent;
- innit, y'know, colloquial form of ou used as a sentence-final particle in polar questions

[used only in informal speech and only recently in writing]

Etymology: Contraction of standard es i [ɪˈzi] "is it", part of a series of similar contractions of the copula with pronouns, like sco "am I", sti "are you (sg)" which despite their verb-subject inversion are also nonstandardly used in declarative clauses (sti'n connart "You're a dick").

Its use in polar questions seems to date back to the sixteenth century (though usually written out as es i until the twentieth), while using it to mean "yes" is much more recent and was initially restricted to correcting negative questions. In this it resembles French si "yes, in response to a negative question", and indeed on the basis of phonetic similarity direct French influence has often been supposed.

Zi, sco'n bal n'oc ort.
/zi | xɔn bal nɔk ɔrt/

58.5: Fiellas Dimenja

Fiellas Dimenja (English: Sunday Sheets) is a weekly newspaper almost continuously published from Marsella since its incorporation in 1871. The paper's notional remit comprises entertainment and recreational news, although in practise it has regularly covered weightier subjects.

History
Fiellas Dimenja was established in 1871 by Corsican businessman Toscobardo Matutte in concert with the Guiraud Colloquium.

Fiellas was an early adopter of machinal broadcast direct to homes via their tachygraphs, first offering digests in this form in the 1920s.

The paper developed a significant international readership through the twentieth century—by 1934 it was republished synchronously in Vascony and New Provence, and was even read in Collusion territory, despite the rising tensions of the post-Millstone Europe.

By 1950 it held the record for the longest uninterrupted weekly mass-market publication, without interruption by the 1937 Veldsvindung nor the Millstone War (although it briefly moved its printers to Manòsca during the worst of the bombings).

Fiellas' renown grew further after its significant role in the Furore of 1961, which (not undeservedly) earned the paper a reputation for investigative journalism alongside its ostensible purpose of delivering entertainment and recreational news.

Correspondents
Jacint Brunat (fl. 1950), reviewer of books and films
For the best experience I recommend you spend the afternoon drinking Empordan and singing as many songs of glory as you can think of. [The Ascendant (1934)]

This will be no classic: come only for the views (of beautiful forests, and a bevy of handsome actors, I concede) and two hours of mindless tragedy. [Zachariah (1950)]

59.2: travodar "negotiate"

travodar /ˌtra.voˈdar/ [ˌtʀa.vʊˈdaː]
- negotiate, treat, discuss, to confer with others in order to reach an agreement on some issue;
- barter, haggle, deal, to argue with a seller over the fair price of a good;

Etymology: backformation from Middle Boral travodað "negotiation, discussion, barter (n.)" as if a past participle. In fact the noun comes from Welsh travodaeth "discussion, commerce", from travoda "I handle, discuss, deal with".

Nos som travodant posc je semman ados!

doujug grader /duˈʒaj graˈdɛr/ [dʊˈʝaj gʀɐˈdɛː]
- hierarchy, power structure, pecking order, ladder, an organisation of people or sometimes objects or concepts by rank

Etymology: idiom seen from the fifteenth century, literally "web of ranks". The noun doujug "cobweb; network, system" was originally a northern dialect term from the phrase doun jug /dundʒəj/ "July's down feathers", while the adjective grader is a regular derivation from grad "rank, (noble) title, status", from Latin gradus "step, rank".

59.4: validar "certify"

validar /ˌva.liˈdar/ [ˌva.lɪˈdɑː]

- testify, corroborate, substantiate, back up, to confirm or support a statement with additional evidence;
- test, prove, verify, authenticate, to check the validity of worthiness of

Etymology: from Middle Boral validar, a borrowing from Scholastic Latin validō "I render (something) worthy or valid". This is a non-Classical derivative from adjective validus "strong, healthy, worthy, valid" originally used in legal settings.

Se poð jo nolois cavir validað ag reu.

59.5: 19th-century Espionage and the Invention of Software

    collected notes on two entirely unrelated works of literature.

Men of Jet and Diamond (originally published in Welsh under the title Dynnon o Vuhuð a Diamont) is an 1890 trevold written by Hasinick Welshman Cadogan Torrior, shortly after he graduated from the University of Nadacow [capital of Hasiny, located not far from the coast on the banks of the *Mississippi] as a scholar of diplomacy.

Published by Blackburn Editions, the work is a rather late member of the first wave of masquira romance. The book was modestly popular in eastern Mendeva [North America], but became much more widely known after being adapted by a New Provence guild into the wildly-succesful 1951 film 'Jet White' (New Provincial Blanc Sabaje).

---

The Parable of the Mute Bookbinder (originally published in Burgund as Fable dew Reillour Mut) is a philosophical treatise written in 1743 by noblewoman Rachel Desselut in response to Vallakis on the problem of the bounded self-duplication of living things (in brief: how can a finite being contain within itself the ability to create a full copy of itself?).

Desselut's work lays out the separation of Form and of Method, and how they allow for the unsculpted duplication of a bounded being. She argues that in order for living matter to duplicate, the Form must contain within itself an explicit Method describing in some readable language its construction. Thus she inferred the existence of a vital language (in her own writing she called it the Divine Word; we now know it as heredian acid [DNA]) present in the cases of the body.

60.2: los "flagstone"

los /lɔz/ [lɔz]
- flag, flagstone, slab, paving stone, a flat rectangular piece of rock or stone used for paving or roofing;
- stepping stone, a stone that can be stepped on in crossing an obstacle like a stream or marsh;
- building block, component, a single part used to build a larger construction or system;
- (stair) landing, the flat area at the top of a flight of stairs;
- platform, dais, podium, a raised area on which to stand;
- pavement, sidewalk, the (often paved) areas at the side of a road where people can walk;
- (figuratively) foundation, basis, building block, stepping stone, a means of advancing from one's current position

Etymology: originally in the first sense and descending from Old Boral los "flag, slab", reflected by synonymous lausa in Medieval Latin (and later Vascon llosa "slate", among others). This is thought to be from a Kelt form *lausā related to known līvus, whence for example Irish lie "stone, pillar".

Jo me cou battuð d'un hom raðant ag los.

- track, route, a course of way especially one fixed for vehicles like trains or else  a path conceived of as one from a choice of multiple such paths;
- module, class, course, a taught series of lessons or lectures covering a particular topic in the context of a syllabus with many concurrent such courses;
- channel, source, feed, a particular source of media (whether radio, TV, internet, etc)

Etymology: from Old Boral riu "stream, small river", from the synonymous rīvus in Latin. First attested in the scholastic sense from eighteenth-century student slang at the Vithor New School, and in the last sense first applied to tachygraph casting in the twentieth.

Caye un pont a los tras y reu.

60.4: nis "effort"

nis /nɪz/ [nɪz]
- effort, exertion, the work involved in doing something;
- élan, vigour, ardour, zeal, spirit, energy, active strength of body or mind in its capacity for expending effort towards some goal;
- strain, force, pressure, power exerted to physically push against something;
- responsibility, fault, obligation, duty, something for which one is responsibility;
- care, attention, investment, concern, interest, the state of being focused on something

Etymology: from Old Boral nis, neȝs, niȝs et al. "effort, vigour", which descends uncomplicatedly from Latin nīxus, nīsus "strain, forward momentum". This is the participle of deponent verb nītor "I lean on, advance, strive, contend", which does not survive in any descendant.

60.5: Santrafew

Santrafew (Merch /sənˈtɹa.fəw/; Provincial Sant Rafeu /sanˈtra.vaw/) is the capital of New Provence. Located on the Mendevan coast on the banks of the Becouin River, it is one of the oldest European settlements on the continent's mainland.

History

Santrafew was founded in 1564 as a trading post for Provincial merchant guilds. It was named for the archangel Raphael in his guise as a patron of travellers. In its first century, pocket communities of people appeared in Santrafew, as the fleets of Provence employed mariners from across the Middlesea.

Early imports into Santrafew included horse stocks and metal tools, traded in exchange for furs and new foodstuffs.

In 1590 Derek Nassow, the heir apparent to the Duchy d'Avosche in Willemy, fled overseas to Santrafew for unclear reasons. This led to an incendiary scandal that rocked courts across Western Europe and especially that of King David of France.

The 1621 Becouin Treaty outlined the legal relationship of Santrafew to the Mendevan peoples of the region for some generations. Following the British Sack of Santrafew, in which the Mastoisèt in particular were alleged to have collaborated, the treaty was broken by Mayor Alexandre fi Marco's embargo and ten-league exile of the Mastoisèt in particular (and other Mendevan groups in practice).

Immigration into Santrafew spiked dramatically in the 1820s, in the aftermath of the Second German War. The newcomers arrived in greatest numbers from Barcelon and Lombardy, spurred on by a combination of wartime displacement and presumably some familiarity with Provincial language.

Santrafew had means sufficiently-fast commnication across the Atlantic Ocean by the 1930s that papers such as Fiellas Dimenja could be published simultaneously there and in Vascony.

People

Alexandre fi Marco (fl. late c17), mayor responsible for the exile of Mendevan peoples from the vicinity of Santrafew
Sauveir d'Orz (fl. 1620–26), town mayor remembered only for his impotence
Carol Zancoud (d. 1630), reverend who accrued paramount (but unofficial) political power over the town
Nadàlla fi Carol (fl. 1590), daughter of Carol Zancoud whose extensive diary has survived to the modern day and is a vital window into early life in the settlement

But to understand the final years of Wolfstan II of Northumber, we must look two centuries earlier, to the very first Viking raids on the shores of Albion and Ireland.

61.2: grivlar "sift"

grivlar /griˈvlar/ [gʀɪˈvlɑː]
- sift, sieve, winnow, to sort (e.g. wheat from chaff) using a sieve or similar implement (also metaphorically);
- qualify, moderate, hedge, limit, restrict, to amend a statement of fact with some mitigating clause;
- sharpen, clarify, refine, to be more precise about a statement;
- sharpen, upscale, to render an image with greater resolution

Etymology: verbal derivation in the Old Boral period from grivle "sieve" (modern grivr). This noun descends from Vulgar Latin criblum, a dissimilated form of cribrum "sieve".

I rob y parol bogr grivlað.

- tangle, snarl, knot, a twisted mass of yarn or other stringlike material;
- problem, dilemma, tangle, mess, bind, imbroglio, a complicated situation with no easy way forward

Etymology: originally in the first sense only, from Old Boral glomscel "yarn, tangle". This descends from Vulgar Latin glomiscellus "ball of thread", a popular diminutive of Classical glomus.

Com voum nos se corrir pall'oc glonscel?

61.4: avant sy rau "shamelessly"

avant sy rau /aˈvant si ro/ [ɐˈvan si ˈʀo]
- shamelessly, brazenly, flagrantly, with no regard for someone's comfort or propriety;
- in full view, openly, in public, exposed, easily visible to someone (especially of something you would expect to be concealed)

Etymology: from early Middle Boral au sy rau [əu si rəu] "brazenly, in a way that provokes ire", literally "in front of the disdain (of someone)". The preposition au "in front of", from Latin apud "by, near, unto", had obsolesced and been supplanted by synonymous avant (from ab ante "from before") by the nineteenth century.

The noun rau "disdain, scorn, (esp. societal) disapproval" is also obsolete outside this idiom, and is furthermore of unclear etymology. If of Latin origin all of reus "guilty", rabidus "furious" and an unattested *rōdus "slander" (from rōdō "I slander") have been suggested; if German then perhaps some cognate of Merch rough "unkind, rude". Attempts to connect the word to Welsh rhew "frost, disdain" are semantically tempting but otherwise unsubstantiable.

Synchronically the idiom is usually misinterpreted as containing the unrelated word rau "uncooked vegetables, salad" (from Kentish raw "raw"), as though avant my rau meant "in front of my salad".

    L'er mell'yam sleghant avant my rau!

##

61.5: Parachthony

Parachthon art refers to works depicting a world different from the real world, encompassing everything from merely divergent histories to entirely invented settings. The word parachthon was coined in the mid-nineteenth century and derives from the Ancient Greek prefix παρα- 'beside, contrary to'" (cognate with Latin prae- and English fore-) attached to the root χθών 'ground, soil, earth, world' (cognate with Latin humus 'soil'.)

History

A seminal work of modern parachthon literature is Elsebeth Sneider's 1795 trevold 'Through a Black Mirror' (originally written in Saxon Dutch as Durgh'nen Shorzen Shouer), arguably the first true voidtale work. Its publication sparked the so-called 'voidtale craze' of grand voyages through the void visiting colourful, bustling xenic worlds—in this respect this tradition recalls the popular imaginings of the Earth-bound geoscopic voyages of the Intertwining Century nearly three hundred years earlier.

The voidtale craze persisted until the 1820s, at which point its optimistic and exploratory character dropped rather rapidly out of fashion faced with the horrors of the Second German War. By then the fashion had spread as far afield as Madray and China, with the renowned landscapist Narayanan commissioned to paint vistas of the seven other planets then known.

The mid-nineteenth century was somewhat of a nazir for parachthon art. Romance moved on to masquira and herdtale's more mundane settings, while historical revivals populated the world's stages. With the maturation of genres in the twentieth century we begin to see purposeful melding of parachthon elements in stories of other sorts, like lovetales and ænigmata; this and the incorporation of related movements like Futurism brought parachthony back into popular art for good.

The progress of technology was often presaged by parachthon works, and so many items of vocabulary for modern contrivances have their origin there. As examples, the 'stafemesh' (now usually just the 'mesh') is lifted from the pages of Ashford Pasquier's 1968 trevold Starsail, and the use of 'slate' for a flat surface displaying information can be traced all the way back to Hadasse Docquerl's 1872 work 'Dealsome Onomatory of the New London' (originally published in Borlish as Un Onomatoir Partial dy Novel Londr).

62.2: inquittar "quote"

inquittar /ˌin.kwɪˈtar/ [ˌɪŋ.kwɪˈtɑː]
- quote, excerpt, cite, to repeat the exact words that a person has said or written;
- testify, attest, to bear witness to the veracity of something;

Etymology: seventeenth-century verbal derivative of inquit "quote, citation, excerpt, attestation". The noun inquit is a learned borrowing from Latin inquit "he/she said", a personal form of the highly defective verb inquam "I say".

Jo dis noc l'ig meyon inquittað con!

- jam, preserves, marmalade, a sweet mixture of fruit boiled with sugar and allowed to congeal;
- sop, bribe, payoff, something given or done in order to pacify someone or soften a blow

also çamoc a sceinç /tsaˈmɔk a xints/ [tsɐˈmɔk ɐ ˈçins]
- fig leaf, a perfunctory attempt to cover up something undesirable to satisfy common notions of propriety;
- kayfabe, suspension of disbelief, a common agreement not to acknowledge the falsity or staged nature of something

Etymology: late Middle Boral borrowing from contemporary Merch chammock "pulp, jam". This is presumably a derivative of verb chammen "chew, chomp", which is thought to be of imitative origin. In figurative use it derives from the use of jam to sweeten bitter medicines.

The idiom dates to the eighteenth century, literally "jam to convention".

J'am çamoc sciftar ag tostuð.

- chokepoint, bottleneck, the part of a process that is slowest or most cumbersome

Etymology: originally in the first sense, a Middle Boral deverbal from vuglar "to choke, clog, jam". This verb is an alteration of earlier vugrar, borrowed in the Old Boral period from Old English wyrġan "to strangle, worry".

Ja sco ne vugl router.

62.5: The Mysarnos Codex

The Mysarnos Codex is an illustrated manuscript written entirely in an unfamiliar script which eluded decipherment for centuries.

Context
The Codex was composed in the sixteenth century and first stored by somebody (presumably a monk) at the Library of Saint George the Martyr, one of the largest buildings in the sprawling church complex located north of the city of Mysarnos.

Mysarnos was at the time the capital of Mystra, a mordether vassal of the Roman Empire. Located at the western end of the Athenian Way, Mysarnos flourished as a hub for the Revitalist movement during the sixteenth century, receiving half of all Greece's imports and swelling to a population of nearly thirty thousand.

The author of the Mysarnos Codex has never been conclusively identified, although several candidates have been nominated. Despite extant and complete membership records for the area's monasteries, no mention is made of the production of the Codex in contemporary chronicles.

Content
The Codex is thought to have originally comprised over two hundred vellum illustrated folios (several are lost but gaps can be deduced from various tallies). The illustrations include both mundane scenes such as poppy fields as well as fantastical vistas like armoured men on dragonback.

The text consists of a set of approximately 180 different glyphs (there is disagreement on whether some pairs of glyphs are mere variants or indeed separate), arranged into words and paragraphs.

Decipherment
For centuries scholars presumed the Mysarnos glyphs to have been entirely invented by their author. The Good Game period of the late nineteenth century saw this narrative collapse, with artefacts first from old Pylos (by then a neighbourhood of Mysarnos) and then from Crete surfacing bearing the same glyphs.

It became clear that the author of the Mysarnos Codex had had access to a store of writing in this script, and perhaps had even known how to read it (many words within the Codex matched the truly ancient examples). The revelation that the Mysarnos glyphs were being used to write a form of Greek only came in 1939, with the unearthing of the lost First Folio at the venerable Library of Sobjan. This text began with a fictionalised biography of the author written both in contemporary Greek and in the codex's script, which allowed for direct comparison and thence, with work, a full decipherment.

63.2: sciftar "spread"

sciftar /xɪfˈtar/ [çifˈtɑː]
- spread, smear, to distribute a thin layer of some material or subtance onto a surface;
- cover, layer, to arrange into layers;
- tidy up, neaten, sort out, cause to be in a more pleasing or less cumbersome arrangement;
- (metaphorically) tie in a bow, resolve, take care of, to deal with something in a way which is satisfying

especially quelt sciftar /kwɛlt xɪfˈtar/ make the bed, to arrange one's bedsheets neatly

Etymology: from Old Boral sciftar "to arrange, tidy", borrowed from Old English sciftan "divide, apportion, arrange". Specialisation to senses to do with layering is seen from the sixteenth century, likely by analogy with making the bed.

J'ay my pan sciftað a çamoc demay.

63.3: lasc "film"

lasc /lax/ [lax]
- film, membrane, coat, a thin layer of some substance;
- iconic [photography] film, the medium (originally ivorine [celluloid]) by which images are captured with a camera;
- film, movie, motion picture, a work of visual art in the medium of recorded moving images

Etymology: borrowed in the Middle Boral period originally in the first sense, either via Roun French lage "film" or directly from synonymous lágye in Dorstad Dutch. This is a diminutive of lágh "layer", cognate with English "low". Extension to photography took place in the nineteenth century; the word was applied first to the light-sensitive coating and then to the film as a whole.

63.4: cosogr "jointly"

cosogr /koˈzɔjr̩/ [kʊˈzɔjɐ]
adv.
- jointly, collectively, en masse, together, considered as a single set of things;
- in unison, as one, moving or acting all in the same way and at the same time;
- (of people) together, in a romantic relationship with one another
prep.
- together with, alongside, at the same time as or in the same set of things as;
- (of people) dating, with, in a romantic relationship with

Etymology: from Middle Boral adverb cosogr "as a pair, as a group"; prepositional use descends from the construction cosogr a X "in a set with X". This comes from Old Boral noun cosoȝre "the other of a pair, (in the plural) a matching pair of things" and homonymous adjective "corresponding, respective, concomitant".

The noun cosoȝre is a broadening of Borlish Latin cōsocer, cōsocrum "the other party to a contract", which is a local spelling and sense of Classical cōnsocer "the father of one's child's spouse"; the fathers of a marrying couple being prototypical counterparties to a contract.

63.5: Devon

Devon (Welsh Devneint, locally Dewna; Borlish Dorogn) refers geographically to the southwestern peninsula of the land of Albion, and politically to one of the most longstanding tallaths of Britain.

History

Devon is named for the Dumnōniī (the Latin name reflecting Classical Kelt Dubnonī or Dubnantī, meaning "(people) of the deep valley"), a Kelt people who inhabited the region in Roman times.

Devon was conquered piecemeal by the Saxons, with the defeat at the |Battle of Gaulford in 656 putting the area under the sole authority of the Kingdom of Wessex (although the westernmost region is thought never to have fully submitted to its rule).

In the eighth century, King Vigo the Magnificent of the Britons spearheaded a reconquest of the peninsula with the support of David I of Wynneth, obtained via his marriage to King David's daughter Guinnumar. Over two decades of intermittent warfare were ended with the victory at Petherton, and Vigo was crowned the first king of Greater Devon (rex Magnæ Dumnoniæ), uniting Devon with the region later known as Kernow in Gaul.

The Brethin religious order was founded in eighth-century Tremonnow, at that time in Devon (now in Glousing).

Devon remained in political union with Kernow through the Kernovan Conjuring of 1028 and the concomitant formation of the First Drengot Empire, which claimed control over much of Albion and most of Gaul. Greater Devon became an ambitious and independent-minded vassal of the Empire, with the House of Kernow always closely aligned with the imperial Drengot family.

The collapse of the First Drengot Empire caused political upheaval in Greater Devon. The Realignment of 1225 saw Devon become de facto independent from Kernow, now ruled by a cadet branch of the royal family.

However, Devon's independence would not last long; Ivan of Cartaw conquered Devon as part of the various Welsh territorial gains of the thirteenth century. Soon thereafter David IV of Wales declared the Tallath of Devon (and awarded rule thereof to Ivan's son Marduth).

People

Monarchs of Greater Devon

Vigo the Magnificent (Vigo Ragórwyh, d. 761), who led the reconquest of Devon from Kernow

Vigo IV (fl. 940), last monarch to be crowned in the original cathedral of Nauned
Vigo VII (fl. 1120), who attempted without success to conquer the southeastern principalities of Wales
Alan VI (fl. 1225), who orchestrated the Realignment of Devon

Nobility

Golleck/Gorvan of Kernow (fl. c9), granted dominion over Devon by his uncle Alan III

Light with the shortest spans is scattering, having enough energy to affect atoms and give them a deficit of plenty; we say the atom becomes deficient.

64.2: motivar "justify"

motivar /ˌmo.tiˈvar/ [ˌmo.tɪˈvɑː]
- justify, explain, excuse, rationalise, warrant, account for, to provide an acceptable explanation for;
- explicate, contextualise, decipher, elucidate, to make something make (more) sense;
- plan, map out, outline, arrange, to analyse a situation so that it becomes easier to understand

Etymology: Middle Boral, verbal derivation from motif "plan, project, grounds, reason, excuse". This descends from Late Latin mōtīvum "motive, cause", neuter of adjective mōtīvus "moved, stirred".

Comoscon vouð vos l'oc delit motivar?
/ˌko.moˈxɔn vuθ vɔz lɔk deˈlɪt ˌmo.tiˈvar/

- join in, participate, take part, to involve oneself in some undertaking;
- help out, contribute, to provide assistance;
- interfere, intervene, step in, to become implicated in a situation

Etymology: from Old Boral drouȝar "to perform a service, to provide help, to carry out an errand", borrowed from Old English drēogan "to do (a duty), to endure, to bear". At first especially with religious connotations, as of providing Christian charity.

Cu 'sirn droughar de nossy taflot?

64.4: fustagn "denim"

fustagn /fiˈstɛjn/ [fɪˈstɛjn]
- denim, a coarse textile usually made of cotton with diagonal ribbing;
- jeans, trousers made of denim fabric

Etymology: from Middle Boral, borrowed from contemporary French fustagne "twilled, coarse fabric", from Medieval Latin fūstāneum or from some Romance cognate. The Latin is of uncertain origin, perhaps related to fūstis "stick, club".

Port i jamay allors de fustagn?

64.5: First Drengot Empire

The First Drengot Empire, or occasionally the Constant Empire, was the westernmost of the four empires comprising the Second Tetrarchy (also the Medieval Imperia). At its greatest extent it claimed control over much of Albion and most of Gaul. Its major vassals were the kingdoms of Northumber, Markland, Kent, Greater Devon, France and Burgundy, along with several lower-ranking demesnes.

The Empire is named for its ruling family House Drengot, formerly rulers of Normandy alone. The lesser-used name Constant Empire has been employed sporadically by historians or propagandists attempting to claim the prestige of the Classical-era District of Constantius, which occupied roughly the same geographical extent.

The structure of the Empire was quite decentralised; see for example the standing army kept by vassal Tolose for its perennial skirmishes with neighbouring Barcelon. The emperor usually held court in Paris (moved during the eleventh century from Roun)

History

The beginnings of the First Drengot Empire lie with the Kernovan Conjuring, through which the House of Drengot in Normandy invaded and conquered Kent with the support of Greater Devon's House of Kernow. As recompense for their support, the Drengots helped install the House of Kernow on the Devoner throne. This invasion was triggered by the death of the elderly patriarch Rodulf of Kent, who had ruled since childhood for nearly eight decades.

The Empire was most stable in the decades around the turning of the twelfth century, having reached its greatest territorial extent. However, by 1120 much of the treasury had been spent on defending the long eastern border with Willemy. In particular, the construction of a new Great Castle at Vésonçon had been completed the year before, the last point in a defensive line spanning from Flanders to the Alps.

In 1170 the Kingdom of Burgundy ceased to be a vassal of the First Drengot Empire, due to the political turmoil of the Emergency at Dijon.

The First Drengot Empire formally ceased to exist in 1191 upon the death of Daniel IV; his demesne was divided between his immediate family and his allies.

Emperors

Nathaniel II (fl. 1067), who quashed a popular uprising in Flanders
Roger II (fl. 1121), under whose aegis Devon attempted to invade Wales without success
Daniel IV (d. 1191), last ruler of a united Drengot Empire

Ny reyaum catrem, y gran castel sorgent com un casner deur y citað ag mar jonc sta vert.
In the fourth kingdom, the great castle rising like an oak from the city on the reed-sea was green.

Y pieðr dy cost heilander stan covart de mos pille, tandic y bris saler cola sur yarç boscer yeðrot portant.
The stones of the land side were covered in thick moss, while the salt breeze streamed over trellises of ivy.

65.2: pille "felted"

pille /pɪˈle/ [pɪˈle]
- felted, matted, fulled, brought together as a fabric with pressure and rolling instead of spinning and weaving;
- cushioned, padded, thick, soft, having thickness in a way which would lessen the impact of a collision;
- softened, mitigated, made less harmful or more palatable in some way

Etymology: Middle Boral learned borrowing from Latin pilleus "made of felt; felt cap"; compare inherited pegl "cap, woollen hat". Seen in metaphorical use from the sixteenth century.

Jo socquau ne my caðer pille cos ajoutað.
/ʒo sɔˈkwo ne mi kaˈðɛr pɪˈle kɔz ˌa.juˈtaθ/

65.3: costoscment "authorities"

costoscment /ˌko.stɔxˈmɛnt/ [ˌko.stʊxˈmɛnt]
- authorities, law enforcement, powers that be, the bodies that have political, administrative or especially judicial power in a given sphere

Etymology: nominalisation from verb costojar "defend, police, regulate", an Old Boral derivation of noun costosc "protection, defence". This descends uncomplicatedly from Latin custōdia "safekeeping, custody"; compare Kentish costage "imprisonment, captivity".

Ascur alcun hom n'a costoscment mis all'yert.
/aˈxɪr aˈgɪn ɔm a ˌko.stoxˈmɛnt mɪz aˈljɛrt/

65.4: gamblas "barge"

gamblas /gamˈblaz/ [gɐmˈblaz]
- barge, punt, flat-bottomed boat used for transport of cargo along rivers and canals;
- houseboat, a vessel such as a barge used as a dwelling

Etymology: Middle Boral borrowing from contemporaneous Kentish gamblass "barge", itself extracted from Welsh łong gamblas "canal ship". It is presumed that the first component łong "ship" was treated in Kentish by folk-etymology as the adjective "long", in a reversal of its Latin origin in (navis) longa "longship".

L'oc compostion de pont parmet coval menn gamblas apar.

65.5: Second Roman Empire

The Second Roman Empire, seldom or historically referred to as the Empire of the Hellenes, the Empire in Byzantium, Malchassian Rome (specifically denoting the centuries of rule by the Malchassian dynasty) or the Eastern Roman Empire (which extends somewhat further back in time), was the political and cultural continuation of the (Classical) Roman Empire following the reconquest of the city of Rome from the Eastern Goths by Emperor Justinian I. The Empire persisted in some form for over a millennium, with its final collapse occurring in the seventeenth century.

History
Many Christian heresies had their origins in the Second Roman Empire, especially in the first millennium. These include all the so-called 'Grecian heresies', as well as Marmeronism. When individuals in the Empire who espoused such viewpoints acquired significant influence, the Empire had a propensity for exiling them (contrast the habit of bodily mutilation practised on political, as opposed to religious, dissidents) to far-flung monastic communities.

During the Second Tetrarchy, the Empire reached a territorial maximum (with the capture of Derban in 1026), controlling lands from Corsica in the west to the Hazaran Sea in the east. However, by this time the outlying regions enjoyed significant autonomy, especially where the independent power of the Roman Papacy loomed larger than the might of Constantinople.

Following the fall of the northern Lombards in Italy, the ruling family fled to the Empire and managed to obtain appreciable clout there; some members were appointed to administer the Empire's western themes, and the written accounts of others are history's strongest sources for certain events during the turmoil of the German Secession in the thirteenth century.

Having fallen into somewhat of a state of disrepair, the fourteenth century saw extensive reconstruction of the Hagia Sophia along with expansion of the complex, headed by Burgund architect Nicolà s'Avignon. (It is for this reason that s'Avignon is sometimes jocularly referred to as the "architect of the Empire's demise", given the tragic events that would take place within the Hagia Sophia three hundred years later.)

66.2: sucquar "sag"

sucquar /sɔˈkwar/ [sʊˈkwɑː]
- sag, droop, slump, to sink in the middle under the force of gravity;
- flag, tire, to begin to show signs of exhaustion;
- have enough, run out of patience, to no longer have the energy to deal with some nuisance

Etymology: from Old Boral sucquar "to sink, sag, slump", from synonymous søcqua in Old Norse. Seen in the last use especially in the phrase jo sucq den "I've had enough" from the sixteenth century. The latter meanings may have been influenced by Dane sʉg "ill, weary, fed up" or a similar cognate.

Jo sucq de ty connardaç!

- dew, the moisture that settles on plants etc in the early hours;
- moisture, wetness, the state of being imbued with a little water;
- drizzle, particularly light rainfall;
- aerosol, spray, the suspension of droplets of liquid in a gaseous medium;

Etymology: hybrid form attested from the thirteenth century, combining rosað < Vulgar Latin rōsāta "dew" with rorçon < Latin rōrātiō "dewfall", both from rōs "dew".

J'er nuvr sortið cant cou roçon.

tandem /tanˈdɛm/ [tɐnˈdɛm]
- eventually, in the end, at last, occurring after some time and especially later than one might expect;
- at length, interminably, taking up a long time

Etymology: Middle Boral borrowing from Latin tandem "at last", related to tam "so, so much". Apparently once pronounced with initial stress, but the stress had shifted to the final syllable by the seventeenth century at the latest.

Tandem il pardoirn nis e fegrn repaðr.
/tanˈdɛm ɪl parˈdɔjrn̩ nɪz e ˈfijrn̩ reˈpa.ðr̩/

67.2: zurç "jelly"

zurç /zɪrts/ [zɪːs]

- jelly, a dessert made by boiling gelatin with sugar and fruit;
- aspic, a savoury dish of the same texture often made from meat stock;
- (more generally) gel, any substance having the same consistency as jelly

Etymology: early eighteenth century borrowing from French zurce "jelly, aspic", itself from sürze in Bavarn. This derives from a Classical German root sultiō "brine", related to English "salt". The word displaces now-obsolete veros "aspic" (apparently from veðr os "bone glass") in line with the substance's increasing use in sweet dishes.

- lack, be missing, to (potentially) suffer from not having;
- be wanted, be desirable, to be desired by someone

Etymology: from Old Boral istover "be necessary", a verbal derivation of istof "obligaton, necessity, need". This is a univerbation of Latin phrase est opus "there is need". The shift to less urgent wants is relatively recent, occuring over the course of the nineteenth century. Stovir still connotes stronger desire than the alternative construction desirar "to want" (colloquially 'sirar), which sees more use for polite requests.

67.4: jougl "knock-out blow"

jougl /ʒujl/ [ˈʝu.jʊ~ˈʝwɪw]
- knock-out blow, haymaker, sockdolager, a punch that renders one's opponent unconscious, insensible, or otherwise unable to continue to fight;
- rout, trouncing, decisive victory, an instance of winning a contest by a wide margin;
- clincher, determiner, the act or moment that is decisive in settling something

also jougl fair /ʒujl fer/ knock out, KO, render unconcious; jougl cavir /ʒujl kaˈvɪr/ be knocked out, fall unconscious

Etymology: from Middle Boral jougl "death blow, killing strike", deverbal from joglar "to slay, to decisively kill, esp. to slit the throat of". This descends via synonymous Old Boral ioȝlar from Latin iugulō, verb derivative from iugulum "collarbone, throat; fig. a murder". Less-fatal use appears first in the context of prize-fighting.

67.5: Romantic Wars

The Romantic Wars were a loosely-circumscribed collection of wars, uprisings and other conflicts across Europe which took place through the middle of the seventeenth century. As a whole they are sometimes considered the last truly localised conflicts, since by the next century wars of similar scales would begin to involve the Novomund, and would feature alliances between the powers of Europe, Africa and Asia alike. The years 1640 to 1670 cover the 'central' conflicts of the Romantic Wars, although some more peripheral fights may spill earlier or later.

The Romantic period (to wit, the decades during with the Romantic Wars took place) were characterised by great corrogation projects. For example, the Bordew-Audaz canal was completed in 1679, connecting the Atlantic and the Middlesea without having to pass through Morrack-controlled seas.

Perennial adversaries Vascony and Morrack continued their protracted fight through the seventeenth century. Having been on a marked decline for a century, Vascony was forced to cede its economic heart in Portingale to Andalus, which at that time was controlled by Morrack.

Several polities and vassal states did not survive the Romantic Wars; for example, the Principality of Mystra in Greece, which had existed as a vassal of the Second Roman Empire since the eleventh century, was formally dissolved in the aftermath of the Romantic Wars.

Willemy was the focal point of the Blue Trans-Willem War (not to be confused with the White Trans-Willem War), which indirectly led to the dissolution of the Kingdom of Burgundy and the creation of the Duchy of Far Suebia in Bavarn.

Borland's involvement in the Romantic Wars was restricted to a failed invasion (culminating in the Hawkirch Surrender of 1623), along with unstable arrangements with neighbouring polities regarding military aid in their conquests.

Much has been made of the involvement of pirates (to a greater or lesser extend endorsed by political powers) in the Romantic Wars, although recent historiography tends to downplay how much impact these factions really had.

The Roman conflict in Armenia of the 1640s is contemporaneous with the Romantic Wars, but its inclusion within them is a matter of scholarly dispute. Opponents point out that this fight was merely the latest in a series of essentially-identical conflicts between the Second Roman Empire and Arab (and later Turkish) peoples over control of the Hazaran Sea.

68.1: Early Medieval Borland

excerpt in translation from The Story of Borland, published (originally in Boral as Y Stoir d'Istr Boral) for use in classrooms in 1982 by Cordin Editions.

The mixing of the Germanic peoples of the south and west with the Romans of the east and north would proceed only slowly, however, for the next couple of centuries.

The question of fealty vexed the land, with conflicts leading to temporary alliances between Boral and Sothbar or Boral and Angland depending on the political climate.

Eventually, in the early ninth century Roman king Stiglan married his son Marc to the only daughter of Alfegh of Angland, unifying their kingdoms and forcing Southbar to pledge fealty after the circa 810 N Battle of Fendal.

68.2: ne ðougl "rushed"

ne ðougl /ne ðujl/ [nɪˈðʊ.jʊ~nɪˈðwɪw]
- rushed, hasty, slapdash, done in an overly quick way due to a lack of time;

also fair ne ðougl knock off, dash off, to accompishly something hastily

Etymology: literally "in a flurry, in a gust of wind", idiom first attested in the fourteenth century. The noun ðougl "flurry, gust" reflects Old Boral ðouȝl, deverbal noun from ðoȝlar "waft, gust, float on the wind"; this verb descends from Latin adoleō "I emit an odour, I smell".

Jo fey nouf laur mathem ne ðougl ig crevoscr.

68.3: teissir "weave"

teissir /tiˈsɪr/ [tɪˈsɪː]
- knit, weave, spin, to form something by passing lengths or strands of material over or through themselves;
- plait, wreathe, braid, interweave, to weave together the strands or locks of;
- devise, plot, scheme, concoct, to come up with a plan or similar undertaking;
- put together, compose, connect, join up, to bring together disparate elements into some sort of network or chain;
- deduce, infer, to come to a conclusion;
- tell, narrate, to describe events in the form of a story

Etymology: originally in the first senses, from Old Boral teissir, tistre, teȝsre (among many other forms) "to weave, work with thread". These all derive from either Latin texere "to weave" or a Late Latin texēre exhibiting a change of conjugation. Use in the narrative sense is attested as far back as the Classical period; much of the metaphorical usage is likely extended from this first idiom.

Cal mocry son il teissent oy?

68.4: jug "continually"

jug /ʒaj/ [ʝaj]
- continually, ever, still, remaining in a given state or continuing on a given course;
- immediately, instantly, now, starting at this exact moment;

Etymology: from Old Boral iui /dʒyj/ "always, forever, without stopping", which descends directly from Late Latin iūge "constantly, all the time". Replaced in the "always" sense by tojorn < toð jorn "all day" by the Middle Boral period. The expected modern spelling juy was over time altered to jug under the influence of the Latin form. In modern spoken usage the word is confined mostly to imperative constructions.

Ag port penoy sign scaunt 'Abseïr Jug'.

68.5: The German Secesssion

The German Secession was a schism in Christendom which took place in the first half of the thirteenth century. Often considered on of the most influential religious developments of the second millennium, it led to the permanent formalisation of the Ausburg See as independent from Rome with its separate papal line beginning with Paul I/XI.

The Secession generally refers to the period from Paul I/XI's Denunciations and declaration of the sedes sanctissima in Augsburg in 1225 to the capitulation of Rome in 1251, although religious strife due to the schism would wrack the polities of Germany and surrounding regions for centuries to come.

The 1210 declaration of a renewed crusade for Jerusalem by Pope Just, and the military catastrophes that occurred in the course of this push, were a major source of discontentment in Rome. Further, Europe was at the time in the throes of the First Great Dying, a plague that would be surpassed in severity only by the Second Great Dying of the early sixteenth century. (These events are related, in that the plague is thought to have arrived in Europe carried by returning crusaders).

The decades after the Pauline Denuncations saw each individual duchy (and in some cases each county!) declare either for Rome or for Augsburg, in an unstable patchwork of allegiances that would lead to the collapse of the German Empire in spectacular fashion.

The ongoing Baptism of the North (the project to fold the northeasternmost part of Europe into Christendom) was inflamed by the Secession. Along with a new, more totalist Roman Pope in Hermeneus II, it was feared that Augsburg might spread heresy faster than Rome could reach the North.

The events of the Secession have been a perennial subject of dramatisation, most famously (and perhaps most innacurately) in 1961 historical epic 'With the North Star to Guide Us'.

Much as Borland—and many other places—might like to claim ownership of the concept of sugar-spiced cakebread, the basic recipe (though perhaps not Borland's preferred buttefly shape) predates even the mass import of sugar into Europe.

69.2: contentar "appease"

contentar /ˌkɔn.tɛnˈtar/ [ˌkɔn.tɪnˈtɑː]
- satisfy, sate, to meet the needs of by doing what is required for someone;
- appease, placate, to make calm by adapting to the demands of someone;

also
se contentar /se ˌkɔn.tɛnˈtar/ [sɪˌkɔn.tɪnˈtɑː]
- content oneself, be satisfied, make do, to not want anything more than

Etymology: verbal derivation from adjective content "happy, glad, satisfied", which descends directly from Latin contentus "satisfied, lit. contained". This is the past participle of contineō "I keep, contain, fasten". Reflexive use is attested as early as the eleventh century, and the slightly extended senses relating to appeasement appear from the fifteenth.

Nos se contentaum a un tatover soul porçonnar.

69.3: auteç "ownership"

auteç /oˈtɛts/ [ʊˈtɛs]
- ownership, possession, control, having something at one's disposal;
- responsibility, duty, obligation, liability, being able to be held to account for something;
- fault, culpability, being responsible for some state of affairs or some particular occurrence

Etymology: from Old Boral afteç "possession, ownership", used predominated in a legal context and reflecting a parallel formation to synonymous habititia in Medieval Latin: it is a nominal derivation from aft (modern aut), past participle of aeir "to have" (modern aïr). In the latter two senses (it is often difficult to distinguish them in examples) the word is attested from the twelfth century.

Y malvaç cof auteç ag vanc nell'askouð!

69.4: effurar "deprive"

effurar /ˌɛ.fiˈrar/ [ˌɛ.fɪˈʀɑː]
- deprive, deny, dispossess, rob, to prevent from having or to cause to no longer have;
- keep out, keep away, repel, block, to deny access;

also s'effurar
- abstain, stay away, to choose not to partake

Etymology: Middle Boral borrowing from contemporary legal Latin effūror "I rob, I dispossess", from fūror "I steal, I plunder", a deponent verbal derivative of noun fūr "thief".

Stou joun sgarant effurar dy hal sdroy vabian closnautr.

69.5: Avosche

Avosche (Paris French /aˈvɔːʃ/, Willem Dutch /ˈa.vusx/) is a political subregion of Willemy centred on the city of Axton (Grand-Aix /gʀãˈdɛiks/, Aughen /ˈɔ.ɣn̩/), with a strong regional identity. At various points a county, a duchy and a march, it has seen both continual territorial instability (situated between French and Dutch powers) and major urban development into the modern period.

Etymology
The region Avosche is named for its first ruling house, which in turn takes its title from its founder Cuonrat Aihuosc (seen in Latin as Corradus Aevoscus). The name is of obscure origin; the first element presumably reflects Classical German ehu- "horse", while the second may be from suffix -iscas "-ish" (though the vowel is problematic).

Compare the English surname Davush (Merch /daːʃ/, Kentish /ˈdaː.vɪʃ/), which derives from an illegitimate branch of House Avosche.

History
The County of Avosche emerges shortly after the split of the Kingdom of the Franks and the concomitant creation of Willemy. The founding house of Avosche was soon after superseded by marriage by the neighbouring House Nassow (which originated in Francony).

The county was elevated to a duchy in the early sixteenth century, with Roger d'Avosche becoming the first duke. At this time the region was ruled by France. Roger's daughter, Adaillé Nassow, succeeded him and went on to rule for many decades until her death in 1608.

During her reign Adaillé accrued significant influence over her liege David of France. This was punctured by the scandal of her grandson and heir apparent Déricque fleeing to New Provence in 1589.

After a century of stability as a vassal of France, the seventeenth century was particularly eventful for Avosche; it changed hands as the result of various wars and peacetime treaties on five separate occasions. Especially bloody was the Blue Trans-Willem War, which also dissolved the Kingdom of Burgundy.

70.2: haubrjoranç "advertising"

haubrjoranç /ˌho.br̩.ʒoˈrants/ [ˌho.bɐ.ʝʊˈʀans]
- advertising, publicising, promotion, marketing, communication whose purpose is to inform or influence customers about products or services;
- advertisement, commercial, ad, spot, an instance of advertising something

Etymology: seventeenth-century coinage from verb haubrjorar "to announce, to herald, to make public", itself a derivation from noun haubrjour "herald, town crier, one whose job is to announce things publicly". This had shifted from the sense "scout, sentry, lookout; omen, advance warning", in which form it was borrowed from Old French herbergeor "one sent ahead (of a military camp)".

Lorry haubrojoranç er speut bannið.

70.3: sdroy "stock"

sdroy /sdrɔj/ [zdʀɔj]
- stock, inventory, stockpile, a store of goods to be sold;
- freight, cargo, goods or items in transport;
- depot, warehouse, building in which goods are stored in the course of transporting them

Etymology: first attested in the late medieval period as isdroȝ "freight, goods in transport over water; (especially) goods in the maritime trade mesh of the Stadbund [a group of cities in northern Germany and the surrounding regions]", borrowed from synoymous zdruog in contemporary Saxon. This is likely from Polish zdroi "(water) spring, small stream; origin, source, place to find something", though this word's sense development appears to be due to Saxon influence.

70.4: nacleu n'oc ort "looking up"

nacleu n'oc ort /naˈklaw nɔk ɔrt/ [nɐˈklaw nuˈgɔːt]
- looking up, optimistic, on the up, having good prospects and feeling positively abot one's near future

Etymology: idiom first attested in Manuel Kigman's poetry of the fifteenth century, literally "sloping in the ascent". The noun ort "lift, rise, ascent" directly reflects Latin ortus "risen, originated, appeared" (and given the lack of early attestations it may be a reborrowing), while nacleu is from Latin acclīvis "steep".

Posc je Pasq sta jo nacleu n'oc ort.

70.5: Monks and Metropoleis

The Jacobin Fraternity (Borlish Fraterntað Jagovin), historically also known as the Order of Saint James, is a religious organisation based in the city of Axbane on the south coast of Borland.

The Fraternity were founded in tenth-century Flanders under the patronage of Amelia of Bruges. In the eleventh century they were implicated in a local popular uprising against Drengot Emperor Geoffry II and forced to flee over the sea to Borland. There they built the Peninsular Monastery which still overlooks Axbane.

Funds from the Fraternity contributed to the Jacobin Estates on the outskirts of Damvath, which on their completion in the late eighteenth century became the fixed location of Borland's parliament.

Today the organisation is known mostly for the guild they own, Jaibos Breweries, as well as for owning significant lands in the city (including the site of one of the ancient Roman bathhouses there).

---

The Riverine Cities were an alliance-federacy of small independent states along the Danaw River and its tributaries linked by treaty and trade in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Each state consisted primarily of a single urban area and the surrounding rural hinterland, though the enforcement of territorial borders was often rather nominal.

The political structure of the Riverine Cities grew out of the ashes of the Kingdom of the Danaw, which had collapsed in spectacular fashion after the Second German War of the 1820s.

The Cities were a hotbed for underground or subversive organisations, including the Deviance movement, and were host to several semi-public tovarick communities. This environment was likely fostered by the presence of significant religious minorities and the strong ties between the Church and the local urban authorities.

Members of the Riverine Cities included Belgrade, Boxa, Gollamo and Pojon.

Etymology: from Old Boral hiu "form, appearance", borrowed from Old English hiew "shape, appearance, colour". Specialisation to the appearance and comportment of people occurred in the Middle Boral period.

Il aun heu equal cos stoniscent, ða meðes jammel.

svingar /svɪnˈgar/ [zvɪŋˈgɑː]
- brandish, wield, to hold something (especially a weapon) in an ostentatious or threatening manner;
- flourish, wave, show off, to display something ostentatiously

Etymology: Middle Boral borrowing from some Germanic language, most likely Saxon swingen "to swing, wave, brandish", but Merch and Horther have also been suggested.

Toll'aucoum ediculat ern tijon svingant.
/ˌtɔ.loˈkum eˌdi.kiˈlat ɛrn̩ tiˈʒɔn svɪnˈgant/

- lay out, array, display, to arrange in a certain way so as to spread or space apart;
- muster, assemble, rally, to call together to form a group (especially as of soldiers)

→ enombranç /ˌe.nɔmˈbrants/ [ˌe.nʊmˈbʀans]
- list, enumeration, count, tally, a sequence of items placed into some order;
- layout, array, display, order, arrangement, the particular placement of a set of things in space;

→ enombranç corporal /ˌe.nɔmˈbrants ˌkɔr.poˈral/ [ˌe.nʊmˈbʀans ˌkɔː.pʊˈʀal]
- periodic table, the arrangement of chemical elements by atomic mass

Etymology: The verb enombrar is a sixteenth-century borrowing from Latin ēnumerō "I count up, I reckon", based on existing noun nombr < Latin numerus "number". Military use dates from the Democratic Wars of the mid-eighteenth century. The adjective corporal "material", a Middle Boral borrowing from Latin corporālis "physical, concrete", is from the eighteenth century used as a noun meaning "chemical element".

Threshold force [nuclear fission power] is the force derived from splitting the nuxes [nuclei] of atoms. The name 'threshold' refers to the so-called 'threshold heft [mass]' of an unstable substance like killdark [uranium], above which one has a self-sustaining detaxion [1].

History
The story of threshold force begins in 1902, with the discovery of the atomic nux—that is, the discovery that almost all of the heft of an atom is located near its centre. This took place at the Nÿstad Atellier (then privately owned and run by substantial theorist [2] Lohic Courvoisier de Nÿstad) in the Cappatian city of Warnøw [3].

The first threshold mills capable of supplying force for general use were in operation by the 1960s. These, and the unsettling martial applications of threshold force which had already been demonstrated on a small scale, brought the concept of harmful shortform luxes [gamma rays] into the popular consciousness. Many a blacklayer [horror movie] of the period and thereafter features unstoppable invisible rays inflicting horrors on the characters.

The corporal used in the vast majority of threshold mills, killdark, was first isolated in the early nineteenth century in the Irish shire of Killdara (whence, via Welsh kildárc 'from Killdara', the substance's name).

Portingale was a pioneer of threshold force, funding research into its effectivity in the 1950s in a bid to reduce their dependence on astraphor [electricity] exported by the Drengot Collusion. The polity's efforts were repaid in full; Portingale became a net exporter of astraphor in the 1970s.

72.2: ombisc "resignation"

ombisc /ɔmˈbɪx/ [ʊmˈbɪç]
- resignation, stepping down, retirement, the act of leaving a job or other duty

→ ombisc souvr /ɔmˈbɪx ˈsu.vr̩/ [ʊmˈbɪç ˈsu.vɐ]
- resign, step down, retire, to leave a job

Etymology: From Middle Boral ombisc "surrender, capitulation, giving up; resignation, act of leaving a post", deverbal from now-obsolete ombijar "surrender, capitulate, give up; resign, leave a post". This descends with a change of valency from Old Boral onbiȝar "subdue, quash, overcome, bring under control", itself borrowed from local Old English onbiegan "bend, subdue".

The verb phrase translates literally as "to release resignation, to let go of resignation". Compare var souvr "declare war" and ley souvr "uphold the law".

L'Agathin a Famigl soloy ombisc je Viendr.
/ˌla.gaˈθɪn a faˈmajl soˈlɔj ɔmˈbɪx ʒe ˈvjɛn.dr̩/

72.3: monfiar "multiply"

monfiar /mɔnˈfjar/ [mʊɱˈfjɑː]
- multiply, proliferate, to cause to increase in number;
- grow, increase, to make more significant or more developed;
- duplicate, copy, replicate, to create a copy or copies of

Etymology: from Old Boral moutfiȝar, montfiȝar "to multiply, increase in number; breed, procreate", reflecting a presumed Vulgar Latin *multificō "I multiply" (see Andalus muchiguar "to augment, grow, extend" from the same source). This is a variant of the synonymous multiplicō in Classical Latin.

Forms with <n> are either scribal error, simple liquid l>n dissimilation, or influenced by the unrelated verb montar "to rise, go up, increase".

Y stuðant parsiscen comoscon ronç monfiar.

72.5: Markland

Markland is a polity of Albion, situated east of Wales, north of London and Kent, and south of Northumber and Sodrick.

Markland 2000.png
(The approximate extent of Markland proper in 2000 N.)

History
Markland originates with Saxon settlements in sub-Roman Britannia, which in the west formed (what would go on to be named) mearce land "borderland". Compare the related demonym Mierce "people of the border", whence the Latin name Mercia and native Merchman "man from Markland".

The petty kingdom of Anglia was annexed by Markland with the Treaty of Oxford in the late eighth century, at the dawn of the Viking Age. This established the persevering border between the mouths of the Severn and the Tames, and incited renewed influx of people into the petty kingdoms on Borland.

Markland weathered the Viking Age much more successfully than neighbouring Northumber, though much of its eastern coast was settled by Danes; the city of Lincon served as the de facto border of Danish rule for several decades. In part this was the inevitable result of tensions along the Welsh border; even during peacetime Theodric the Awefast maintained substantial levy forces.

The tenth-century Elved Marriage (which took place near the modern city of Leeds) ended hostilities between Markland and Dane forces in the east for almost a century. It is said to have been solemnised over a sandstone block later inlaid into the Redstone Chair, a low-backed wooden throne on which many subsequent monarchs were crowned.

Around the turn of the second millennium, Markland was conquering territory from the northern reaches of Wales (incidentally leading to Pope Agatho's canonisation of the Welsh St David). The perennial conflicts between Markland and Wales would come to be collectively referred to as the Mallor Wars.

The First Drengot Empire of the eleventh and twelfth centuries counted Markland as a major vassal, conquered from the south following the subjugation of Kent by Normandy and Greater Devon in 1029.

The Mallor Wars were reignited after a quiescent period by the martial-minded King Andrew II, with the Sack of Rexam in 1301 during which the original St Brigid's Abbey burned to the ground.

Markland was embroiled in the Wars of Fealty in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Tensions over the location and possession of the Redstone Chair boiled over into a conflict that would last forty-one years. Markland conceded several battles to the young Kingdom of Britain in the early years of the wars, culminating in the 1483 Battle of Rexam which expanded the borders of Wales in the north and killed the last Duke of Chestre.

In the final years of the Wars of Fealty, a code known as Thieves' Script was employed by the forces of King Andrew III, apparently adapted from similar systems used by gangs of housebreakers in Nottingham. It is remembered today as a very early precursor of codes like steeplescript or modern one-zeffre encoding.

The poor economic conditions and population displacement in Markland following the Wars of Featly led it to suffer almost twice as many deaths per capita from the Second Great Dying compared to polities like Willemy.

Long contested between Markland and Kent, the city of London found itself independent for one final, lasting time following the Democratic Wars of the mid-eighteenth century.

The spellings of various towns and cities in Markland were rationalised during the Long Peace period of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries (for example, Conster for former Colncester /ˈkɔn.stə/).

The 2010 Œcumen Count, a regular census, recorded that Utter Safford was the secondmost populous city in Markland proper with 4.4 million inhabitants, after the capital of Tommarth.

73.1: Review: The Ascendant (cont.)

excerpt in translation from a review of 1934 film The Ascendant by Jacint Brunat, which appeared in Marsellan newspaper Fiellas Dimenja.

The Vascon Ascendancy is no new ground for the screen, with Agochino's more personal I am Ambrose defining the popular perception of Vascony's longest-reigning king.

Nevertheless, I find The Ascendant to be a charming retelling of those turbulent years after the 1471 Landfall, not least in its choice to focus on the more minor personages of Ambrose's court.

73.2: entrquïr "pause"

entrquïr /ˌɛn.tr̩.kwajˈɪr/ [ˌɛn.tɐkwɐˈjɪː]
- pause, take a breather, break, to stop work for a short while between jobs or similar duties;
- gather oneself, collect oneself, to pause in order to prepare oneself to continue;

Etymology: late Middle Boral borrowing from Latin interquiēscō "I rest briefly", adapted to native prefix entr- "between" and verb quïr "to put out, turn off".

Un hour alcheðr lor porreu nos entrquïr.
/ɪn ur alˈkɛ.ðr̩ lɔr poˈraw nɔz ˌɛn.tr̩.kwajˈɪr/

73.3: ronç cadarað "distillate"

ronç cadarað /rɔnts ˌka.daˈraθ/ [ʀɔns ˌka.dɐˈʀah]
- distillate, the liquid that has been condensed from a vapour during distillation and thereby purified;
- essence, extract, the concentrated extract of a plant obtained via distillation;
- (generally) essence, gist, crux, the basic or central feature of something;
- (specifically) diesel, a heavier fuel derived from petroleum (also informally just ronç)

Etymology: phrase meaning "distilled portion", first attested in the sixteenth century. The noun ronç "portion, part, component; fraction, ratio" descends from Old Boral romnç "shard, piece broken off something", a derivation of rompre "to break". The adjective cadarað is the past participle of cadarar "to distil", a late medieval borrowing from Spanish related to Arabic قطرات <qaṭarāt> “droplets”, in reference to the process of distillation.

Cay un ronç cadarað d'ougl tascban.

73.4: stuðant "student"

stuðant /stiˈðant/ [stɪˈðan(t)]
- student, pupil, a person enrolled in an academic institution;
- disciple, devotee, enthusiast, someone who actively follows or admires a philosophy or similar construct;

Etymology: Old Boral stuðant "student", present participle of stuðar "excel, shine, be skilled; learn, practice, improve, train" influenced by Latin studēns "dedicating oneself to, studying". The verb stuðar is a derivative of stuð "clever, intelligent, skilled; interested, engaged, paying attention" (now obsolete outside of fixed expressions), from Latin ā̆stūtus "crafty, cunning, tricksy", and was quickly conflated with shortlived semi-learnèd studiar "to study (in the Church)", from post-Classical Latin studiō "I study" (compare earlier synonymous studeō).

73.5: Ambrosia

Ambrosia (Vascon/Vask Ambroxa) is a polity of north-eastern Mendeva, comprising several islands and much of the mainland up to the Five Seas. It borders New Provence to the south.

History

The story of Ambrosia begins with the Novomundine Landfall of 1471, when Vetomundine travellers encountered Mendeva for the first time since sporadic visits by the Norse. A Vask fishing expedition (part of the New Navarre Enterprise) landed on the island of Brasil, which would go on to host the first European settlements in Mendeva.

The parts of Mendeva first explored by (and whose trade was monopolised by) Vascony—to wit, the island of Brasil and the lands westward thereof—was named Ambrosia in honour of Ambrose III of Vascony.

Ambrosia achieved political and economic independence from Vascony in the early nineteenth century as part of the continent-wide phenomenon of the Mendevan Unmooring.

The first long-distance transmission of an image took place in Ambrosia in 1820, employing the so-called Steeplepost Tapestry (consisting of a wall of tiles painted black and white on each side). This device would soon go on to be the subject of the infamous Lies of 1824.

By the 1880s the most urbanised parts of Ambrosia were connected by wired tachygraph, allowing messages to be sent from home to home.

In 1950 the Japetos submarine Atlantic link conveyed its first messages. It was laid down between Gadire in Morrack and eastern Brasil.

Places

Aiga d'Angoixa, a major city on the Oxagre River and location of the original Steeplepost Tapestry

Illa de Vinna Salvatge, a built-up island in the Oxagre

Paratzon, a town in eastern Brasil

74.2: tascban "vanilla"

tascban /taxˈban/ [tɐxˈban]
- vanilla, a tropical climbing orchid whose pod fruit yield an extract used in food or perfumes;
- the fruit, bean, extract or flavouring derived from this plant;
- (metaphorically) all-rounder, jack of all trades, someone or something with versatile uses or talents

Etymology: seventeenth century, borrowed into Borlish (via Vascon taxbàn or French tacheban) from Morrove Arabic تشبان (tashbān) "vanilla plant, vanilla flavouring". This is an early sixteenth century borrowing from the Thebevan [Totonac] tałpán "vanilla plant" (possibly via Nawat [Nahuatl]).

In the metaphorical sense it is attested from the early twentieth century (originally in Hasinick Welsh but quickly spreading), due to the prevalence of vanilla flavouring throughout cuisine and perfumery.

Scey tascban demay nell'oc scoclet lessy.

74.3: caglou irrayar "focus"

caglou irrayar /kɛjˈlu ˌɪ.reˈjar/ [kɪjˈlu ˌɪ.ʀɪˈʝɑː]
- focus, concentrate, place emphasis, to direct energy or attention to the exclusion of other things;

Etymology: idiom from the nineteenth century, literally "to shine (a) spotlight", transferred from its literal sense in the theatre. The noun caglou "lens, perspective, focus, spotlight; thrust, gist, nub (of an idea)" comes from Norman caillow "small stone, lens", possibly of Kelt origin. The verb irrayar "to shine, radiate, illuminate"  reflects post-Classical Latin irradiō "I light up".

Mell'ouvr irray caglou sur ustolment.

74.4: commotual "turbulent"

commotual /ˌkɔ.moˈtjal/ [ˌkɔ.mʊˈtjal]
- turbulent, tumultuous, agitated, characterised by high-energy disturbance or unrest;
- disordered, in disarray, chaotic, with everything out of its proper place

Etymology: Middle Boral borrowing from Scholastic Latin commōtuālis "riotous, pertaining to political unrest", itself an adjectival derivation of commōtus "(esp. political) movement, unrest, commotion". Compare synonymous Classical mōtus and verb commoveō "I disturb, throw into disorder".

Stoura aïr me cors pall'eç epoc commotual.

##

74.5: The Pistol Mesh

The pistol mesh (Borlish sar pistol), also referred to simply as the mesh, is the global system of long-distance communication which employs a single normalised method for transmitting messages from one endpoint augrimmer to another.

Etymology
The phrase "pistol mesh" (in the Roun French form mail pistre) was first used by writer Ashford Pasquier in his 1968 parachthon work Starsail, describing technology that could transmit written messages, sounds and moving images between people in different star systems.

The phrase literally means "network for messages": the word pistol reflects post-Classical Latin pistola "epistle, written decree", aphæretic form of synonymous epistola; the word mesh descends from Old English masc "net".

History
The pistol mesh grew out of several earlier technologies, all the way back to the first flag-lamp steeplepost lines in the eighteenth century allowing short texts to be sent between signal towers.

A century later sees the emergence of tachygraphs, devices allowing one to type text directly onto the barrick steeplepost from the comfort of one's home. However, it was only with the rise of general augrimmers in the twentieth century that we start to recognise the modern pistol mesh.

By the late twentieth century, the pistol mesh was sufficiently mature that whole enterprises could be conducted using it as a medium. For example, at this time the Tremonnow Open School (formerly the Brethin Mesh Institute) offered history courses across Albion entirely via mesh. Another impactiful development was the blossoming of 'distributed bookhouses', repositories for free-to-access information (much of it lifted from books out of withholding) to which anyone could contribute.

With the conclusion of the First German War in 1770, Saxony was ascendant and controlled more territory than it had at any point in its history. Consider Sneider's writing about the attendant early urbanisation of Lepzi. To what extent did this and her 1772 marriage to Sterncundhaus scholar Otto Sneider influence her writing?

75.2: lessy "whitened"

lessy /lɛˈsi/ [lɪˈsi]
- whitened, bleached, having been acted upon by a bleaching agent;
- faded, washed out, worn out, played out, having lost an original colour or more generally having lost vitality or energy;
- (of hair, chocolate etc) white, considered as a deviation from a former or more basal colour;
- bleach blond(e), having been treated so as to significantly lighten the colour (of hair)

Etymology: originally in the first sense from Old Boral leissi "bleached, whitened; (n.) lye soap". This descends from Vulgar Latin lixīvia "lye", via lixīvus "made of lye" from lixa "lye, alkaline water".

Tu desir un beller epu a scoclet lessy ou?

- nurture, cultivate, grow, to garden or farm (plants);
- foster, educate, instruct, to act as a teacher for

Etymology: from Old Boral ma(c)quar "to raise (a child)", from synonymous Insular Latin maquō, maccō, likely of Kelt origin. If so, cognate with Irish mac "son" and Welsh magωr "cowherd" (formerly "breeder of animals").

Il le macquaurn vars surcair un tarç dagr.

astr mirar /ˈastr̩ miˈrar/ [ˈas.tɐ mɪˈʀɑː]
- stargaze, to look up at the stars at night;
- to perform astronomy, to act as an astronomer;
- daydream, woolgather, to have a spontaneous series of thoughts disconnected from reality

Etymology: phrase meaning "to look at stars", employing the poetic term astr "celestial body, star", borrowed from synonymous astrum in Latin. This sense of mirar "be amazed by, marvel at" to mean "look at" is also somewhat formal or poetic. In metaphorical use the phrase is seen as early as the fifteenth century.

J'er astr mirant all'hour dou je ados.

75.5: Burgundy

Burgundy (Burgund French Borgogne /bɔgˈgɔɲɛ/) is a polity in Gaul, situated south of France, west of Bavarn, north of Provence and east of Vascony. It has for most of its history been ruled from the city of Geneva.

History

During the Second Tetrarchy period of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, Burgundy was a major vassal of the First Drengot Empire. Following the Emergency at Dijon in 1170, which presaged the collapse of said empire, Burgundy became a de facto autonomous kingdom.

In the early fifteenth century with the Vascon Ascendancy, Burgundy lost its Middlesea coast to Vascony. Burgundy managed to wrest the territory of Provence back from Ascendant Vascony in 1494. This would however be a very temporary state of affairs: the region seceded with the 1497–99 War of Provincial Independence, ending in Burgundy's defeat at the Battle of Margès.

No longer having any coastal territory, Burgundy weathered the Second Great Dying, which began in 1519, comparatively well; the principal vector of plague transmission was via naval trade. This relative stability may be related to the kingdom's (unusually late for the region) formal retention of the feudal system until the dawn of the seventeenth century.

The title of King of Burgundy was dissolved after severe losses to neighbouring Bavarn in the Blue Trans-Willem War of the late seventeenth century. The former capital Geneva became a subordinate city in the Duchy of Far Suebia.

A polity named Burgundy was formed once more (now without a monarch) in the nineteenth century, as part of the diplomatic process leading to the formation of the Drengot Collusion.

Nentamen, y character dell'eç caum vienn dy poið a nou fanglanç preluïscendessem yon no se poð for apponment addoit a them.
Nonetheless, the character of these pieces draws upon yet earlier innovations about which we can only make educated guesses.

Cal teissir, com bustr, des y benoç communal dy kyriel manoscart ne bempart all'eç ouvr?
What to make, for example, of the shared use of the manoscard scale in many of these works?

Lonc ustol figurau nos ig y manoscart fos un orðenjanç borgonnesc dy siecr doç nuverrem,
Traditionally we conceive of the manoscard as a Burgund innovation of the late twelfth century,

origin ayent parmy ci hymn parformað ny communtað religious ag region Luberon auster.
beginning with hymns performed in the religious communities of the eastern Luberon region.

By the time we do have evidence of manoscard melody in contemporary popular music,

we see use of the scale across western Europe as far north as Mondwell and as far south as Bagliemmo, so it is difficult to determine its true homeland.

76.2: caum "piece"

caum /kom/ [kom]
- (obsolete) prayer, psalm, canticle, a religious text when set to music;
- hymn, any song of praise or worship;
- (more broadly) song, piece of music, an individual work of musical expression with or without lyrics;
- poem, artwork, piece, any artistic creation and especially one which is written;
- article, story, report, piece of nonfiction writing as might be published in the press;
- (mesh) post, any original work (prototypically writing) published to the mesh

Etymology: disputed. Semantically it should derive from Latin carmen "poem, incantation, prayer", but the phonological development is troublesome. Vocalisatio of /r > u/ is otherwise only attested in the presence of following /r̩/, as in Maucr "Wednesday" < *Marcre < Mercuriī; this has led some scholars to postulate an Insular Latin variant *carmus, carmera, but this is unattested.

Reanalysis of the plural carmina as a feminine singular is, however, not out of the question. One might then suppose that dissimilation produced *carmira, but again this is unattested.

The word has seen significant semantic bleaching over time; the sense "poem" is first seen in the fifteen century, the sense "article" in the eighteenth, and the sense "(mesh)post" in the late twentieth.

Jo componoy l'oc caum por cinq baðr.
/ʒo ˌkɔm.poˈnɔj lɔk kom pɔr tsɪnk ˈba.ðr̩/

76.3: orðenjanç "invention"

orðenjanç /ˌɔr.ðɛnˈʒants/ [ˌɔː.ðɪnˈʝans]
- invention, innovation, some new mechanism or technique that one has designed;
- contrivance, contraption, device, some means of carrying out a given task;
- skill, cunning, inventiveness, creativity, the capacity to invent things (often with the connotation of underhanded means or ends)

Etymology: nominal derivative of verb orðenjar "to invent, innovate, contrive, devise". This descends from the particularly-variable Old Boral orðençar, orthanscar, aðincquar "to invent, make up", which appears to be the confused chimera of Old English noun orþanc "creativity, skill, invention" and related verb āþenċan "to conceive of, think up".

Rom ny siecr cinqueç sta ven d'orðenjanç.
/rɔm ni ˈsjɛ.kr̩ tsɪnˈkwɛts sta vɛn ˌdɔr.ðɛnˈʒants/

76.4: errevir "rescue"

errevir /ˌɛ.reˈvɪr/ [ˌɛ.ʀɪˈvɪː]
- rescue, save, deliver, to remove from any form of danger or violence;
- recover, salvage, extricate, to regain something from a prior undesirable location or state;
- (slang) steal, to get into one's own possession by underhanded means;
- to have (something) turn out surprisingly well, especially in the face of difficult conditions

Etymology: from Old Boral erevre, ereveir, from Latin ēripiō "I rescue, save, deliver, set free". Some forms show a conjugation shift from Classical ēripere to *ēripēre (compare cavir < *capēre < capere). Cognate with Barcelon erebre "to protect, guard".

M'orruð il ain l'oc sorty erreut cos pernix.

76.5: The Workshop Period

The Workshop period, or the Global Workshop, refers to the middle decades of the nineteenth century. It is characterised by the rapid expansion and development of industry across the world. Usual historiography places the Workshop period between the Long Peace and the Good Game.

The Workshop period brought prosperity to parts of Europe which had been devastated by the Second German War of the 1820s, such as the Riverine Cities.

The impact of the Workshop period can be seen in artistic trends, with the shift away from voidtales and towards (on the one hand) realistic portrayals of the industrial working class and (on the other) optimistic speculation on future material advancements.

The guild VS (Vindrons Sairzaus), which sold the first widely-sold aphlox wine, would in this period expand its scope to other high-pressure and sealing components in manufacture, securing a very profitable niche.

The late Workshop period saw many barrick breakthroughs, concentrated in eastern Europe and Lower Mendeva.

The Drengot Collusion arose among the French polities of this period. The contemporaneous New Urban Mesh (including London and Axbane, among others) was subsumed by—or took control of—the nascent Collusion.

Many items of vocabulary were innovated in the Workshop period, including recoil "manufacture", underwrit "logo", counterzoic "anti-microbial" and retainer "IUD".

77.1: While Embers Cool

excerpt in translation from spycraft trevold While Embers Cool (originally written and published in Welsh as Pan Oera'r Glo), 1889 work by Hasinick author Kjartan Rhysvor.

Toll'emendanç por y mas son complið, jusc oy, ða vray meðes a i y ci dou rig d'ardois derran allignað cos scaðr.
The repairs to the farmhouse are all done, now, if he really did get those last two rows of slates lined up right.

But all that is gone. It is as if all those years have been erased, as though none of it had happened at all.

77.2: egreir "disembark"

egreir /eˈgrir/ [ɪˈgʀɪː]
- disembark, get off, go ashore, to leave a vehicle;
- step out, to exit a place on foot;
- sally forth, to set out in the manner of a soldier onto a battlefield;
- pass away, expire, perish, (euphemistically) to die

Etymology: Middle Boral borrowing from Latin ēgredior "I step out, disembark, overstep, leave", a compound of prefix ex- "out" and root gradior "I walk, march". It was modelled on the sole native descendant of a gradior compound, engreir "to begin; to sleep with" (since lost, although the participle engres "way in, starting point; sexual intercourse" remains). In euphemistic use the verb is first attested in the eighteenth century.

Dighað: neleð me gemir / Ciel seraun yonoscon egreir.
/daˈjaθ neˈlɛθ me ʒeˈmɪr | tsjɛl seˈron ˌjo.noˈxɔn eˈgrir/

77.3: lavaç "wasteful"

lavaç /laˈvats/ [lɐˈvas]
- wasteful, prodigal, thriftless, lavish, not being economical with one's resources;
- extra, superfluous, gratuitous, redundant, spare, unnecessary, surplus to requirements

Etymology: Middle Boral borrowing from early Roun French lavace "wasteful, spare", originally "abundant, copious". This comes from a homonymous noun meaning "abundance" (originally "torrential rain"), a derivation from verb laver "to wash", from Latin lavō "I wash, bathe".

Tu a scaumel lavaç meyon benoçabr ou?
/ti a xoˈmɛl laˈvats miˈjɔn ˌbe.noˈtsa.br̩ u/

##

77.4: orruðar "seem"

orruðar /ˌɔ.riˈðar/ [ˌɔ.ʀɪˈðɑː]
- amount to, be, to be the same as or equivalent to;
- seem, to give the impression of or to be thought of in a particular way;
- (impersonal, with dative experiencer) think, deem, reckon, to have an impression of something

Etymology: from Old Boral oruðar, ouruðar "to take up space, take the form of; to amount to", from Late Latin obrūtō "I overwhelm, conceal, cover, take up space". This is a regularisation (with unexplained lengthening of the root vowel) of synonymous obruō in Classical Latin, based on the past participle. In impersonal use it appears to be syntactically modelled on Germanic constructions like English methinks "it seems to me".

Orruðe hour laundaus lavaç sad.
/ˌɔ.riˈðe ur lonˈdoz laˈvats sad/
[ˌɔ.ʀɪˈðe ʊː lʊnˈdoz lɐˈvas sad]

It seemed an awful waste of time.

77.5: Continents and Conjugality

The Novomund, also called the New World, refers to the lands to the west of the Atlantic Ocean. Inhabited for over a myriad years, the history of these lands comes together with that of the Vetomund following the Novomundine Landfall of 1471.

The Novomund is composed of the two great landmasses of Mendeva and Cappatia [North and South America], along with over a dozen major islands (such as Brasil [Newfoundland] and Cocain [Cuba]) and innumerable lesser ones.

Many crops now cultivated worldwide were first farmed in the Novomund, including shadome fruit, tartover, shockle and mikecorn [tomatoes, potatoes, chocolate and maize]. Products such as coshow [rubber] and kistmaw [tobacco] also derive from plants native to the Novomund.

---

The Household Renovation of the late nineteenth century was an attitudinal shift towards non-traditional familial structures, the institution of marriage, and the social role of children.

It was prefigured by the deemphasis of religion in government in those countries party to the 1850 Laic Declarations of Belgrade, as well as contraceptive medical innovations of the time like coshow bed-sleeves [latex condoms] and stauron retainers [IUDs].

The popularity of the masquira [~heist/vigilante] literary genre, with its hidden identities and lampooning of upper-class mores, is usually understood to have come hand in hand with the Household Renovation (not to mention the enduring popularity of masquira in tovarick [queer] circles).

Early embracers of the Household Renovation included Britain, the Riverine Cities and New Leudong [a polity in south-eastern Australia]; the ethos would spread (especially via Britain's cultural cachet in Gulf Mendeva) elsewhere over the subsequent decades.

Often cited is a labour shortage of serfs due to the Second Great Dying, allowing those peasants who remained to demand more favourable conditions from their lords.

serfdom (already on its last legs) was legally abolished in 1564 N, but by that point it had not de facto existed on the island for a generation.

78.2: scaðr "square"

scaðr /ˈxa.ðr̩/ [ˈxa.ðɐ]
- square, a plane figure with four sides of equal length and four right-angled corners;
- square number, a number that can be expressed as the product of some number by itself;
- rack, frame, shelving, a wood or metal grid in which one can store things;
adj.
- right-angled, forming an angle of 90 degrees;
- aligned, not crooked or leaning;
- tidy, having everything in its expected position

Etymology: from Old Boral iscaðre, iscarre, carre "square", from Vulgar Latin (ex)quadra "square", variant form of post-Classical quadrus "square". Adjectival usage is attested from as early as the eleventh century.

Me stou for savir ig nos seim scaðr den.

78.3: joivr "frost"

joivr /ˈʒɔj.vr̩/ [ˈʝɔj.vɐ]
- frost, rime, cover of ice crystals on objects that are exposed to the air analogous to dew;
- cold, cold weather, conditions below the freezing point of water when frost is liable to form;
- (telecommunications) noise, static, any part of a signal that reduces the fidelity of its transmission

Etymology: descendant of Old Boral givre, guivre "frost", borrowed from Old French and thought to originate in a Frankish form like gibara cognate with Willem gever "saliva".

Nos targoim y fenestr de joivr ne spaiðant.

##

78.4: dijarbr "decent"

dijarbr /diˈʒar.br̩/ [dɪˈʝɑː.bɐ]
- decent, acceptable, fine, OK, of a sufficiently-high quality but not particularly impressive;
- manageable, doable, feasible, not daunting in scope or difficulty;
- wieldy, handy, able to be handled with grace while not being overly heavy or awkwardly shaped
- (rare) digestible, edible, capable of being eaten and digested

Etymology: adjectival derivation from dijarr "to bear, cope with, deal with, stomach". This verb descends from Middle Boral dijarr "parse, classify, sort out; digest, stomach", a borrowing from Latin dīgerō "I disseminate, disperse, arrange" altered by analogy with now-archaic verb enjarr "to eat" < ingerō "I carry in, pile up".

Servið son quelt dijarbr all'ig tarn.

78.5: The Good Game period

The Good Game period refers to the final decades of the nineteenth century, especially when construed as a time of rising global powers formed of alliances and meshes of trade and technology binding the world together. It conventionally follows the Global Workshop period of spreading industry and ends with the outbreak of the Millstone War.

The same Laic Declarations of Belgrade in 1850 which prefigured the social and moral shifts of the Household Renovation also set the stage for the political realignment of the Good Game decades, which new alliances between states that could not have countenanced such ties even a generation earlier.

This period sees the establishment of several alliance-federacies that would go on to define the geopolitics of the twentieth century, such as the Drengot Collusion in north-western Europe (whose expansion concluded in 1894 with the accession of Borland).

The perception of the Good Game period as a time of glamorous espionage and political machinations behind closed doors is not entirely deserved—compare the popular perception (via books and film) of the 1887 Desarden affair involving a London ambassador and the king of Nackon Day with the tawdrier reality. Nevertheless, the period has cemented itself as a popular setting for spycraft and masquira stories.

The kevler romance arose as a distinct subgenre of masquira in this period, featuring elaborate plans and schemes usually aiming to steal some priceless item.

The 1880s saw a brief fad for 'Morrack fashion' in countries across Europe and the Novomund, in areas such as dress, architecture and food. There was, for example, a trend of incorporating exposed stonework draped in tapestry and curtains in contemporary buildings.

Scientific and technological advances of the Good Game period include discovering other galaxies, determining the normal speed, the first household mesh-linked tachygraphs, and stauron retainers.

79.2: jagottað "jagged"

jagottað /ˌʒa.gɔˈtaθ/ [ˌʝa.gʊˈtah]
- jagged, notched, serrated, rough, being unevenly cut or having a similar texture to something so cut;
- craggy, rugged, (of landscape) characterised by unpredictable changes in elevation;
- abrasive, harsh, disagreeable, being overly agressive in one's manner and causing irritation

Etymology: past participle of jagottar "to notch, serrate", from noun jagot "notch, snag, sharp projection", of uncertain origin. Likely a diminutive of a form *jac, jag, which must be related somehow to the synonymous jag in Merch—the direction of borrowing is however unclear since the Merch is only attested from the fifteenth century. Attempts have been made to connect the words to Borland English çagge "shrub" but the semantics are doubtful.

emendanç /ˌe.mɛnˈdants/ [ˌe.mɪnˈdans]
- fix, repair, something done to mend a broken object or situation;
- resolution, solution, answer, something that solves a problem

Etymology: noun derived from emendar "to fix, repair, resolve, sort out", which descends (via Old Boral amendar, later re-classicised) from Latin ēmendō "I improve, remedy, cure".

L'emendanç ottem plagra alcun hom.
/ˌle.mɛnˈdants ˈɔ.tɛm plɛjˈra alˈkɪn ɔm/

79.4: cay seg a veðerrem "elephant in the room"

cay seg a veðerrem /ke sij a veˈðɛ.rɛm/ [ke sij a vɪˈðɛ.ʀɐm]
- (int.)  tactful acknowledgement of a lie or secret everyone knows about but nobody will call out;
- (n., usually hyphenated) elephant in the room, such a lie or secret

Etymology: idiom first attested in this form in the late eighteenth century but having many variants beforehand; literally "it takes six (months) for the eldest (child)". This refers to a couple's first child being born only six months after the wedding, a situation where it is clear to everyone what happened but to mention it explicitly would be impolite.

Quippe alcun hom nil y budr de cay-seg-a-veðerrem svoccar.

79.5: Voidtale

Voidtale (Borlish trevogt /treˈvɔjt/, portmanteau of trevold "novel" and vogt "outer space") is a subgenre of parachthon romance which focuses on voyages through outer space visiting alien worlds.

The genre was pioneered by Saxon author Elsebeth Sneider with her 1795 work Through a Black Mirror, which sparked a three-decade long fashion for the subject known as the "voidtale craze". This first period is characterised by a strongly pre-empirical understanding of conditions on other worlds: no particular attention is paid to the details of breathable air or bearable gravity, and each bustling planet is peopled by very human societies. Indeed, more than anything else these stories resemble the "geoscopic voyage" tales of the previous century, which depict sailors exploring unknown corners of the Earth and encountering the peoples there.

The voidtale craze is usually said to end with the Second German War in the 1820s, although later works like Narayanan's landscapes (which portray barren and inhospitable surfaces of the other planets orbiting the Sun) are generally counted as part of the same tradition.

It has been claimed that the voidtale craze inculcated an enthusiasm for astronomy in its generation, and contributed to the cosmic discoveries of the mid-nineteenth century—including the discoveries of the planet Janus and the speed of light.

80.2: bojar "move"

bojar /boˈʒar/ [bʊˈʝɑː]
- move, shift, bump, budge, to cause to be displaced from a position;
- dislodge, free, extricate, to remove from a position in which something was firmly set
- reconsider, to change one's mind

Etymology: from Old Boral bojar "move, shift", originally in both intransitive (it moved) and transitive (I moved it) use but by the Middle Boral period only in the latter. This is a borrowing from synonymous Old French bougier, from Vulgar Latin bullicō "I boil, bubble up", a frequentative from bulliō (whence Borlish boglir "to boil").

My granmaðr noloy se bojar cas scadom pascr.
/mi granˈma.ðr̩ noˈlɔj se boˈʒar kaz xaˈdɔm ˈpa.xr̩/

Etymology: from the sixteenth century, taken from the Latin stage direction in theatrical scripts exeunt "they leave", used as a noun "act of leaving (a stage, and metaphorically any situation)".

Il aun ig rekestað jo faç exeunt lon massant.
/ɪl on aj ˌre.kɛˈstaθ ʒo fats ɛkˈsawnt lɔn maˈsant/

- bank, riverbank, the area along the sides of a river or stream;
- shore, seashore, strand, a stretch of coastline (especially when stony as opposed to sandy);
- beachfront, seaside, promenade, terrace, esplanade, a walkway between land and sea often lined with shops

Etymology: uncomplicated descendant via Old Boral rif from Latin rīpa "riverbank, seashore". By the Middle Boral period we see a clear semantic separation between sandy play "beach, bay" and stony rif, although some place names like Volandry (from dialect volan "gull" and rif "beach") fail to fit this dichotomy.

Nos erau flannant lonc y rif, ig carnt yon beller acatar.

We were walking down the strand, looking to buy sweets.

80.5: Tavancy

Tavancy (Merch /təˈvan.səi/, Run'allo [Quechua] Tawanden /taˈwan.dɛn/), formerly the Tavancine Empire, is a political in western Cappatia [South America] occupying the coast between the Isthmus [of Panama] to the north and Maboutian [~Chilean] lands to the south.
Toponymy

The name Tavancy (Latin Tavantia) is a back-formation from the adjective Tavancine (Latin tavantīnus). This comes from the earliest Latin name imperium tavantīnum first attested in the sixteenth century, which was borrowed via Morrove [Morrocan] Arabic as a somewhat-mistaken partial calque from the Run'allo tawantin-suyu "the quartet of provinces".
History

The first Vetomundine people to document the Tavancine Empire were Morrack [Morroco] traders with the New World Company (شركة العالم الجديد), who had already begun dealing with Arcabil [Caribbean] peoples and with Mashick [the Aztec Empire]. Through the sixteenth century several wayports along the west Cappatian coastline were established by said traders, some of which would grow into substantial staddomain [~export colony] settlements.

The death of Tavancine Emperor Cariwasari in 1660 is suspected to have been an assassination carried out on Morrack orders, purportedly to allow for more profitable trade in silver—Morrack was at the time running low on funds to support their ongoing wars in Vascony and Libya.

In the early 1930s, a collaboration between alchemists at the Branwen Sanatory in New Leudong and the University of Rimack in Tavancy led to the discovery of cozebdo-diamaschal benjamine [ibuprofen] (in pill form familiarly called "CD" or, in Markland, "Tommy pills") as an effective hebetant [painkiller] without significant adversions [side effects].

81.1: Everything About You

To commemorate the closing night of the musical Groundhog Day this last weekend, something a bit different: translated lyrics of the song Everything About You.

E tu a hougr de narr, eð y fin dell'oc mont
And you're afraid of clowns, and the end of the world

81.2: ajoutaçar "be fun"

ajoutaçar /ˌa.ʒu.taˈtsar/ [ˌa.ʝʊ.tɐˈtsɑː]

    be fun, entertain, divert, engage, to be interesting in an enjoyable way;
    charm, please, delight, to receive pleasure or satisfaction from something

Etymology: eighteenth-century verbal derivation from ajoutaç "gratification, enjoyment, satisfaction", itself derived from ajoutar "gratify, help out, please" with the somewhat-pejorative or diminishing suffix -aç (from Latin -āceus "shaped like"). This root verb descends via Old Boral aioftar from post-Classical Latin adiuvitō "I help out, assist, am useful", from earlier synonymous adiuvō with a frequentative derivation.

    Y fabr nou scenað t'ajoutaç ou?
    /i ˈfabr̩ nu xeˈnaθ ˌta.ʒuˈtats u/

81.3: flaut "boating"

flaut /flot/ [flot]

    boating, sailing, the activity of going out onto water in a vessel;
    fleet, armada, a collection of sea-going or river-going vessels

Etymology: direct descendant from Old Boral flaut "fleet, group of ships", a borrowing from Old English flēot "ship, group of ships" (related to float).

    Il faun flaut casc juglot.
    /ɪl fon flot kax ʒajˈlɔt/
    [ɪl fon flot kax ʝɐjˈlɔt]
    3p do-3p boating each July
    They go boating each July.

##

81.4: vis "in fact"

vis /vɪz/ [vɪz]

    evidently, of course, manifestly, as you know, used to introduce information which one feels is sufficiently obvious that it should have come up by now;
    in fact, actually, in reality, indeed, used to introduce a statement which corrects some part of a previous understanding;
    it transpires, it turns out, apparently, used to introduce surprising new information

Etymology: extracted in the late Middle Boral period from expressions like vis es… "it is seen that…", as the past participle of veir "to see" < Latin videō "I see". Speculation that it is instead a retention of Old Boral ivis "sure, certain", a borrowing from synonymous Old English gewiss, is unsupported by any intermediate attestations (though cf modern Merch awice /əˈwəis/ "indeed, yes").

The word is often found in the collocation Or vis… "Well, actually…", especially when it is used at the start of sentences.

    Vis no som nos jamay eið a Duncloð.
    /vɪz no sɔm nɔz ʒaˈme iθ a dɪnˈklɔθ/

81.5: Madray

Madray is a polity in the southeast of India governed from the city of the same name [Madurai].

The British ship Phœbos in the early sixteenth century stopped at the port of Romeswarm [Rameswaram] in Madray on its geoscopic voyage around Africa and on to Borune [Borneo] (where it would meet the Morrack [Moroccan] ship Cynthia travelling in the other direction).

The death of King Rahulamathavan in 1735 is thought to have been due to an early outbreak of pennackit dysentery [cholera] (although global outbreaks of the disease would not begin in earnest until 1753).

As part of the general Democratic Wars period in the mid-eighteenth century, many states quarrelled for control over parts of India, including Madray. Both relatively nearby powers like China and distant trade interests like Britain became embroiled.

The eighteenth century also saw many technological developments out of this region. For example, the use of pedal holes in musical instruments was pioneered by the peria nadaswarm (the apex of arms races to widen pitch ranges and increase volume) which would influence instruments like the torriot into their modern forms.

The voidtale craze begun by Elsebeth Sneider in 1795 reached as far as Madray; the renowned landscapist Narayanan is especially remembered for his series of works depicting the planets from their surfaces.

82.1: Dane-ruled York

excerpt in translation from 1997 academic textbook Del Christianizamento dell'Isole Norroveste (On the Christianisation of the Northwestern Isles), written by historian of Middle-Age religion Dijaca Rofotto.

82.2: vogt dy foscur "dead of night"

vogt dy foscur /vɔjt di foˈxɪr/ [vɔjt dɪ fʊˈxɪː]
- pitch blackness, inky blackness, a particularly deep darkness;
- dead of night, small hours, witching hour, the part of the night conceived of as the darkest and farthest from day

Etymology: idiom first attested in the poetry of 15C writer Drominir, literally "emptiness of darkness". The noun vogt descends from Vulgar Latin *vocitus "empty", a variant of the synonymous vacuus in Classical Latin. The noun foscur is a noun derivative of adjective fosc "dark" which descends from Latin fuscus "dimly lit, black".

Y lamp se quïsceu, y coloir augtant ne vogt dy foscur.
/i lamp se ˌkwaj.iˈxaw | i koˈlɔjr ojˈtant ne vɔjt di foˈxɪr/

##

82.3: cas sar "online"

cas sar /kaz sar/ [kɐsˈsɑː]
- online, available over or accessed via the Internet;
- cyber-, pertaining to the Internet or to activities conducted on the subject of or via the Internet

Etymology: phrase first attested in the 1980s, from the preposition cas "pertaining to, on the subject of, at the home of, with respect to, when it comes to" (via Old Boral cas from Latin casa "house") and the noun sar "fishnet, mesh, network" (from the synonmous Vask). The noun sar in this usage ("the Internet") is shortened from the phrase sar pistol "lit. the message mesh", itself translating Roun French mail pistre /maʒ piːtə/ in the same sense. This was first used in 1968 work of fiction Starsail, by Ashford Pasquier.

Nos som gran sviðour a conemir cas sar.
/nɔz sɔm gran sviˈður a ˌko.neˈmɪr kaz sar/

82.4: scenar "stage"

- stage, put on, produce, perform, to put together a theatrical production as an acting troupe;
- orchestrate, undertake, arrange, direct, carry out, to plan and go through with some scheme or undertaking with many moving parts

Etymology: Middle Boral verbal derivation from scen "(theatre) stage; platform, soapbox" (formerly sometimes re-classicised as scæn), borrowed from Latin scæna "stage, scenery" from Ancient Greek σκηνή "tent, stage". In metaphorical use seen from the eighteenth century.

Y tissour aun un exeunt scenað.

82.5: London

London (Borlish /ˈlɔn.dr̩/) is a city and polity on the island of Albion. The city is downstream on the River Tames, and the polity comprises much of the Tames' watershed. It is bordered to the north by Markland, the south by Kent, and the west by Britain.

History
London was established by the Romans shortly after their invasion around 50 N, named from a Kelt placename referring to the local floodplain.

After time as a secondary city in Albion, London became the imperial capital of the region once more during the Second Tetrarchy as part of the First Drengot Empire.

The First Burning of London took place in 1290; at least 400 people were killed in the ensuing week-long disaster. This was one of several conflagrations in the first half of the second millennium, many due to the city being perennially conquered from the north or south.

The Democratic Wars of the mid-eighteenth century saw London finally gain lasting independence from its neighbours in 1748 under Queen Margaret, who could trace her ancestry to the royal families of both Markland and Kent. The office of Lord Mayor remained politically powerful enough to rival that of the new monarch, however.

London is home to the New Lyceum, a preeminent research university established in the late eighteenth century.

Seventy-fifth anniversary celebrations in 1823 saw significant infrastructural investments in the region, with a great deal of building along the south bank of the Tames.

London's population grew rapidly during the Global Workshop period of the mid-nineteenth century. It became a lead member of the New Urban Mesh of several major cities in the region, and spearheaded the Mesh's takeover of (or submission into) the larger Drengot Collusion.

The independent polity of London has been long associated with spycraft, with events like the 1887 Desarden Affair (involving the London ambassador to Nackon Day) and the many Londoners in the Roun Red House (the intelligence centre for the Drengot Collusion) implicated in the Furore of 1961 cementing this image in the popular imagination.

Ebbasham, a minor spa town

83.2: narreyar "taunt"

narreyar /ˌna.riˈjar/ [ˌna.ʀɪˈjɑː]
- taunt, mock, make fun of, to say or do something which makes someone seem foolish;
- goad, provoke, to cause someone to respond to you annoyed or angry;
- (intransitive) jest, fool around, to tell jokes or otherwise act in a comedic manner

Etymology: via Old Boral nariȝar "to taunt, goad" from Vulgar Latin nāricō "I snort", related to nārēs "nose". Respelt in the Modern Boral period by conflation with narr "fool, jester, joker", which was borrowed some centuries earlier from Germanic (cf. Saxon narr "wildcard; maverick").

Mell'amig lou narreyau vars agir temerer.
/ˌmɛ.laˈmaj lu ˌna.riˈjo varz aˈʒɪr ˌte.meˈrɛr/

##

83.3: eir sauf a "all but"

eir sauf a /ir sof a/ [ɪː sof a]
- come close to, all but, almost, to go nearly so far as to do something

Etymology: idiom literally "to go except to", first attested in the fifteenth century. The verb eir "to go" descends directly from Latin eō "I go", while the preposition sauf "except" is slightly problematic. The regular descendant of Latin salvus "free (of)" should be sau; the final -f may be due to influence from Old French.

J'eu sauf a lou sveilar n'ortellent atras.
/ʒaw sof a lu sviˈlar ˌnɔr.tɛˈlɛnt aˈtraz/
[ʝaw sof a lu zvɪˈlɑː ˌnɔː.tɪˈlɛnt ɐˈtʀaz]

83.4: linaç "lineage"

linaç /liˈnats/ [lɪˈnas]
- lineage, line, descent, a line or tree of offspring from a common ancestor;
- family, house, dynasty, a group of people related by descent (particularly when of noble birth);
- birth, parentage, blood, ancestry, one's characteristics as considered to be a result of the qualities of one's forebears

Etymology: from Old Boral linaç "lineage, parentage", probably borrowed from Old French but in any case related to lign "line; line of descent". In the sense "house, dynasty", attested from the twelfth century.

Y segr possey linaç aðief por vous dou.

83.5: Loveless Lepzi

Lepzi is the capital city of Saxony, located on the Bleak Alstre.

History
Lepzi first acted as political centre for the First Kingdom of Saxony, very briefly just prior to its collapse at the close of the thirteenth century. The Houghbrocken dynasty ruled from there for some years before being removed to Magdeburg when the house was reduced to the four-year-old Marksman Baldur.

With the conclusion of the First German War in 1770, Saxony was ascendant and controlled more territory than it had at any point in its history. Lepzi was subject to attendant early urbanisation and trebled in population in just fifty years. It was one of the vanguards of the Global Workshop period, exploiting vast amounts of locally-mined coal power.

The Blue Marian Society, which agitated for inheritance and suffrage law reforms, was founded in the nineteenth century in Lepzi.

People
Albert Siegert (fl. 1744), owner of a leatherworking and cobbling industry based in Lepzi
Elsebeth Sneider (m. 1772, d. ~1830), author and originator of the voidtale craze with her 1795 work Through a Black Mirror
Otto Sneider (m. 1772), scholar at the Leipzi Sterncundhaus

---

Rachel Desselut (fl. 1743) was a French philosopher. She is best remembered for her 1743 work The Parable of the Mute Bookbinder, which discusses problems of infinite regression and of identity.

She was born to Maurice Desselut, eighth Lord Bouvoin, who was a writer and explorer. Fittingly he was also an infamous libertine (the house name Desselut deriving from an Old French word meaning dissolute, philandering).

She was the first to lay out in our modern terms the philosophical distinction between Form and Method, which allows an entity to self-replicate (constructing its Form from the Method's instructions, then transcribing the Method blindly). These concepts would go on to be vital in the study of methodics and to general augrimmer practice.

Desselut inferred from her work the existence of a vital language, now known to be composed of heredian acid.

84.2: vondrous "grotesque"

vondrous /vɔnˈdruz/ [vʊnˈdʀuz]
- grotesque, distorted, caricatured, having abnormal proportions in a stylised manner;
- shocking, outrageous, egregious, bad in an impressive way;
- hideous, ugly, displeasing to the eye

Etymology: from Old Boral vondrous "miraculous, awe-inspiring, unbelievable", adjective derivate of vondre "miracle, marvel" (now obsolete). This is borrowed from the synonymous wundor in Old English. The worsening semantic shift was entirely complete by the seventeenth century.

Casc ouvr pent ag ci mur stan vondrous.

84.3: lodrignether "technical"

lodrignether /loˌdraj.neˈθɛr/ [lʊˌdʀaj.nɪˈθɛː]
- surgical, diagnostic, pertaining to medical intervention;
- technical, procedural, operational, formal, relating to some form of protocol;
- detailed, pedantic, hair-splitting, persnickety, being (overly) concerned with rules or trivia

Etymology: first attested in the eighteenth century, adjectival derivation from somewhat older noun lodrigneth "medical intervention, operation; technique, procedure, protocol". This is borrowed from Welsh łodrinnaeth "surgery, medical intervention" (cf. also the calqued Merch handiwork "surgery"), whose root is in trinna "to handle, treat".

Lodrignether l'ig no's meðes un pescot.

84.4: jagat "setting"

jagat /ʒaˈgat/ [ʝɐˈgat]
- setting, world, context, scenario, the time and place in which a narrative takes place;
- continuity, world, universe, a setting shared by a collection of fictional works;
- (poetic) universe, cosmos, Creation, the totality of all things in reality

Etymology: nineteenth century borrowing via Vascon from Gurjat જગત <jagat> "world, universe", used as a term of art for "setting" in literary criticism. This is a learned reflex of synonymous Sanscrit जगत् <jagat>, from a root cognate with English "come". Its poetic usage recalls the original sense but is not used in ordinary speech or writing.

Cay sdroy cas sar de jout jagat.

84.5: Lower Mendeva

Lower Mendeva (Borlish Mendeva Bassem /ˌmɛn.deˈva ˈba.sɛm/) is a geographical region comprising the southern section of the continent of Mendeva, located west of the Mendevan Gulf. The term sometimes also includes the islands of the Arcabil, which are located within said Gulf.

Contact between Lower Mendeva and the Vetomund began in the late fifteenth century with merchant ships from the Morrack New World Company (established by Malik Munir al-Hamdawi in 1463). In turn, traders therefrom encountered the peoples of the Arcabil, the Mashick Empire in Lower Mendeva, and further south the Tavancine Empire in Cappatia.

The region is predominated by the polity of Mashick, which stretches from coast to coast and so far north as to border Mivock in the west and Taisha in the east.

Many barrick innovations of the late Workshop period came out of Lower Mendeva, likely due to practical concerns around the rapid spread of wired post (there being little previous adoption of the flag-lamp steeplemesh in the region to displace).

By the late twentieth century, this region had become major exporters of foods such as mause and amback.

Many trade goods originated in Lower Mendeva, including billrod dye, shockle, shadome and tashban.

85.2: surplombar "overhang"

surplombar /ˌsɪr.plɔmˈbar/ [ˌsɪː.plʊmˈbɑː]
- overhang, hang over, impend, to be suspended above;
- overlook, to be located higher up than (as of a building on a hill);
- threaten, imperil, to place in a dangerous position;
- impinge upon, affect, interfere with, clash with, to have a (usually negative) impact on;
- to immediately precede in time

Etymology: Middle Boral coinage from sur- "over" (< Latin super-) and plomb "lead, weight, sound", conjuring the image of a weight suspended above something. In the third and fourth senses, from the inherent danger of the suspended object falling on one (attested from the sixteenth century); in the last sense originally in guild jargon and perhaps then jocular (attested from the early twentieth century).

85.3: seucq historic "posterity"

seucq historic /sawk ˌhɪ.stoˈrɪk/ [sawk ˌhɪ.stʊˈʀɪk]
- posterity, legacy, the status of something from the perspective of future generations

Etymology: collocation first seen in legal use in the eighteenth century, originally referring to certain inherited effects. The adjective historic "historical" is a direct borrowing from Latin historicus, while the noun seucq "footpath, trail, tracks; legacy, progeny" is murkier. It descends from Borland Latin silqua, sēlqua "track (of an animal)", though to be of Kelt origin.

Nuvr so jo my seucq historic molinant.
/ˈnivr̩ so ʒo mi sawk ˌhɪ.stoˈrɪk ˌmo.liˈnant/

yeustman /jawstˈman/ [ʝɐwsˈman]
- brewer, someone whose occupation is to prepare alcoholic beverages like beer
- inciter, firebrand, rabble-rouser, someone who instigates unrest or other trouble

Etymology: from Old Boral ȝeost manc/ç "beer seller", from the stem of ȝeostar "to ferment, brew" (modern yeustar), a borrowing from synonymous geostan in Borland English (cf. modern Merch yeast), and the element manc/ç "seller, vendor", either reflecting Insular Latin mantia "shop, household, inn" or Latin mangō "dealer, seller (of slaves)". In metaphorical use from the seventeenth century.

85.5: Laic Declarations

The Laic Declarations were a series of diplomatic documents produced by an international committee of delegations from several dozen polities in Belgrade in 1850. These documents outlined procedures for uncoupling established religions from administrative state functions, and the legal status of people with minority faiths.

At this time, Belgrade was one of the Riverine Cities, an alliance-federacy of small independent states along the Danaw River and its tributaries. These cities had risen from the ashes of the Kingdom of the Danaw, which had collapsed in spectacular fashion after the Second German War of the 1820s. As such, Belgrade was an early hotbed of new religious and legal thinking, with a renowned Promethean club associated with the Deviance movement and a semi-public tovarick community.

Notable non-signatories of the Declarations included New Provence (at the time probably the most Vetomund-oriented polity in Mendeva) and Persia.

In some respects the Declarations were prefigured by the waning of the censorious and moralistic Modest Arrangement. They laid the groundwork for the Household Renovation of the late nineteenth century, which comprised further shifts in social attitudes around family and marriage. The fact of such major international collaboration in writing the Declarations also prefigured the dawn of the subsequent decades' Good Game period, characterised by alliances and espionage.

Laic adoption would go on to spread globally; for example, in Gulf Mendeva the persistent social prestige of Britain is thought by some to have expedited the contemporary social changes of the region.

The hundred-and-twentieth anniversary of the Laic Declarations was celebrated in academia with the Long Future project, including the synchronised publication of dozens of popular works chronicling the Declarations' origins, course and aftermath.

86.2: improbar "disapprove of"

improbar /ˌɪm.proˈbar/ [ˌɪm.pʀʊˈbɑː]
- disapprove of, condemn, blame, to think badly of someone for their actions;
- criticise, critique, find fault with, censure, to enumerate things one disapproves of;
- scold, rebuke, reprove, tell off, to speak harshly to due to disapproval of someone's behaviour

Etymology: backformation from improbation "criticism, critique, condemnation, censure, blame, disapproval" (originally in legal use for "official reprimand for immorality"), from synonymous improbātiō in Latin.

Y maðr improbau sell'heir posc l'ig fo reuluð.

86.3: hapr "groceries"

hapr /ˈha.pr̩/ [ˈha.pɐ]
- groceries, produce, commodities, shop-bought foodstuffs and sometimes other household supplies;
- (loosely) shopping, recently-bought goods that are relatively inexpensive and characteristic of daily or weekly purchases;
- (strictly) fruit and veg, goods which may be bought at a greengrocer's

Etymology: direct descendant of Old Borlish happle "fruit, collectively; yield of a fruit harvest" (since displaced by native frugt < Latin frūctus), borrowed from Old English æppel "apple, fruit; sphere". The appearance of the initial h- is unexplained, but may be a hypercorrection; at this point /h/ was absent in native Borlish vocabulary and was being reintroduced via Germanic loanwords. Its modern sense is influenced by the compound haprman "greengrocer; (later) wholesaler".

J'eye sauf a aïr y hapr yent.

86.4: bougr "fellow"

bougr /ˈbu.gr̩/ [ˈbu.gɐ]
- fellow, chap, cove, bloke, guy, a man and especially an ordinary man of the street;
- (archaic) scoundrel, rogue, cad, blackguard, someone (usually a man) without honour or virtue

Etymology: only recently (early twentieth century) ameliorated from an insult, via Middle Boral bougr "villain, criminal, enemy; pagan, apostate, non-believer" from Old Boral bougre "heretic, evildoer". This reflects Medieval Latin Bulgarus "from Bulgaria", from Old Slavonic, and was probably introduced via contemporary French legal codes.

Un bougr insuet vien de laurar cas y haprman.
/ɪn ˈbu.gr̩ ɪnˈsjɛt vjen de loˈrar kaz i ˌha.pr̩ˈman/

86.5: Bavarn

Bavarn (Bóarn /ˈpoː.ɑːn/) is a centrally-located German polity of Europe. Among others, it borders Bohemia, Burgundy, Furlaine, Saxony, and Willemy.

History

During the Second Tetrarchy, the Kingdom of Bavarn was one of the two main players in the German Empire; the Empire was for some time ruled jointly by the Houghbrocken and Andex dynasties of Saxony and Bavarn respectively.

Thirteenth-century Bavarn was the epicentre of the Pauline Denunciations and the German Secession, leading to the establishment of the Augsburg See. The concomitant strife saw each vassal in Bavarn declare either for Rome or for Augsburg, in a powderkeg patchwork of allegiances that would collapse the Empire entirely. Bavarn itself would never regain as much Adriatic coast as it had enjoyed just prior to these events.

In the fifteenth century, Bavarn was embroiled in an extended series of conflicts with Burgundy. By this time it had also become a technological centre, with workshops developing entirely new glassmaking techniques.

Following the Blue Trans-Willem War of the late seventeenth century, Bavarn gained significant territory from the Kingdom of Burgundy, which subsequently dissolved. As result, then-king Frederick created the Duchy of Far Suebia, ruled from Burgundy's former capital Geneva.

In the eighteenth century, famine and a shortage of grain led to popular unrest that threatened to destabilise the state; the examples of Venise and Crovatia to the south demonstrated how badly things could go for the current regime.

The Second German War embroiled Bavarn, allied with (among others) Borland and the Northern Concert; a particularly significant event during this war was the disastrously mismanaged Battle of Hulm in 1821.

- soil, stain, dirty, sully, to make something unclean or less pure (physically or morally);
- defame, tarnish, smear, besmirch, slander, to damage the reputation of

Etymology: Middle Boral derivation from noun teur "tar" with the suffix -fiar (< Latin -ficō) which forms verbs meaning "to make/render _". The noun teur is an Old Boral borrowing from Old English teoru "tar, resin, earwax", which is related to "tree". Almost immediately we see use of the verb, particularly in contemporary legal cases.

Follastr ne vrugheç a mell'accostur teurfiað.

- breeding ground, fertile ground, epicentre, a place seen as creating large quantities of a stated thing or type of person;
- hotbed, hotspot, an environment that is ideal for the growth or development of something

Etymology: collocation first attested in the late nineteenth century, literally a "nourishing nursery". The noun amaçgat "nursery, childcare" is borrowed via Mostara amazgato "flowerbed; nursery" from Morrove Arabic اَلْمَسْقَى‎ <al-másqa> "seedbed". The adjective is the present participle of ðescar "nourish, feed, fuel", which descends directly from Latin adēscō "I feed, fatten up".

Cay l'ig muncef un amaçgat ðescant vars huyaç.
/ke laj mɪnˈtsɛf ɪn ˌa.matsˈgat ðɛˈxant varz haˈjats/

- strong, built, muscular, brawny, possessing notable physical strength;

88.2: huyaç "organised crime"

huyaç /haˈjats/ [hɐˈʝas]
- organised crime, mob activity, groups carrying out illegal acts seen as a collective, or the illegal acts themselves;
- corruption, unethical administrative or executive practices in government or business

Etymology: nineteenth-century coinage originating in Pentrose slang, a derivative of local dialect term huy "gang, mob, syndicate" with the pejorative suffix -aç < Latin -āceus "resembling". The noun huy goes back to the fifteenth century, and is a borrowing from Kernish chui "crowd, rabble" (cf. Cambrick why "movement").

- heath, heathland, moor, moorland, a tract of level uncultivated land with sandy soil and scrubby vegetation;
- waste, wasteland, badlands, a place with no remaining resources or metaphorically any uninteresting place

Etymology: descendant of Old Boral vruȝeç "heath, moor", which is a nominal derivation of vruȝ "heather" (modern vrug) with the suffix -eç < Latin -itia. The word vruȝ is borrowed from Borland Kelt vrūg "heather", cognate with synonymous frágh in Irish.

- swerve, veer, yaw, to go out of a straight line of motion;
- deflect, deviate, detour, turn aside, to change course (or metaphorically, plans);
- dodge, sidestep, to move out of the way of something

Etymology: from Old Boral desveyar "stray, deviate, go off course", inherited from Late Latin disviō "I leave the path", a variant of synonymous deviō in Classical Latin. Alternatively, a later formation from Old Boral vey "path, course" < Latin via "road" (compare modern veyaç "trip, journey").

88.5: Convoy Australier

The Convoy Australier (Merch /ˈkɔn.vəi əˈstɾɛː.liːə/), officially the Order of Saint Hemma of Still Water, is a Christian organisation aligned with Rome which emerged in the Second Tetrarchy period. It has undergone several major transformations of purpose since its inception.

History
The Convoy began in the eleventh century in the Duchy of Crain, a member of the German Empire subordinate to Bavarn. In the first decades of its existence the Convoy was in essence a (quite literally) glorified band of mercenaries.

The Convoy was heavily involved in the first crusades and related ventures, from the Principality of Mystra in Greece to the then-unsuccessful forays in Jerusalem. It was appointed to administrate the new states of Antioch and Port Simon soon after their conquests in the twelfth century.

Pope Just revoked the Convoy's rulership of Antioch and Port Simon in 1208 as the culmination of a escalating inter-faction struggle. However, it is generally agreed that this act saved the Convoy a great amount of trouble in the long run (given the imminent disaster of the Failed Crusade). The Convoy was subsequently assigned to the courts of Svonimir of Crovatia and Taxon of Hungary; it was thus ideally placed to lead the Baptism of the North, even as the troubles of the German Secession loomed.

The German Secession increased the urgency of the Baptism of the North; Rome feared that Augsburg might spread its new heresy faster than Rome could reach the North. As a consequence, the Convoy grew substantially in numbers and wealth during the thirteenth century, and outlying chapters were founded as far afield as Borland and (eventually) Lithow [Lithuania].

excerpt in translation from 2007 work Four Miles to Freedom (originally released in Borlish as Catr Lau a Leurtað), written by Pentrose-based author Matheu Smodarac. Set in the Pentrose of the early twentieth century, it was praised for its depiction of the city recovering from the ravages of the Millstone War.

89.2: yeul ovart "thoroughfare"

yeul ovart /jawl oˈvart/
- thoroughfare, highway, main street, a major road especially conceived as connecting two towns or district
- (computing) a high-speed network connection

Etymology: collocation first seen in the sixteenth century, literally meaning "open street". The adjective ovart "open, public" descends from Vulgar Latin opertus, alteration of Classical apertus "open". The noun yeul "street, wide road" reflects Old Borlish ieol "unpaved road" (as opposed to vei "paved road"), which given Welsh heol "route, passage" is presumably of Borland Kelt origin. In the latter sense attested from 1977.

89.3: annex denover "afterthought"

annex denover /aˈnɛks ˌde.noˈvɛr/ [ɐˈnɛks ˌde.nʊˈvɛː]
- afterthought, an action or reflection done after the fact;
- something done at the last-minute or in an improvised manner, like a correction, addition or improvement

Etymology: idiom attested from the nineteenth century, literally "final-stage addition". The noun annex "supplement, appendix, addition, boost, enhancement, refinement" is a deverbal from verb annexar "to supplement, append, boost, refine", which comes via Scholastic Latin annexō from Classical annexus "attachment".

The adjective denover is a contemporary derivation from denou "conclusion, ending, denouement; the final stage of any process", itself also a deverbal from denovar "untie, unravel; end". This is an Old Borlish derivation from nou "know, tangle", from the synonymous nōdus in Latin.

L'oc sorty enter sta tor annex denover.

89.4: sveldr "whittle"

sveldr /ˈsvɛl.dr̩/ [ˈzvɛl.dɐ]
- pluck, to remove the feathers from a bird;
- whittle, carve, to cut or shave a piece of wood with a knife;
- reduce, thin, cut away at, to gradually make something smaller or less numerous;
- winnow, to separate out the best members or items of a group and remove the rest;
- (colloquial) rob, swindle, con, cheat, to deprive of property by deceit or force

Etymology: from Old Borlish isveldre "to pluck, remove parts of", a pleonastic derivative of a presumed *veldre descending directly from Latin vellō "I pluck, depilate, demolish". Extension to woodworking is attested by the thirteenth century, in abstract use it is seen from the fifteenth, and the colloquial sense first arose in the late eighteenth before a revival (or re-coining) in the twentieth.

89.5: Second Tetrarchy

The Second Tetrarchy, in older works also called the Medieval Imperia, refers to the period of roughly two centuries at the dawn of second-millennium Europe when a good deal of the land was (at least nominally) under the jurisdiction of four empires: the First Drengot Empire, the German Empire, the Second Roman Empire, and the Single Caliphate.

The name "Second Tetrarchy" was first used in the eighteenth century by the writings of Vascon historian David Bensaíd, in reference to the Roman Tetrarchy of the early fourth century, although the two political regimes had little else in common.

The First Drengot Empire began with the Kernovan Conjuring of 1028, when Normandy conquered Kent with the support of Greater Devon. Over the next years House Drengot went on to consolidate lands from the Middlesea to Edinbrough.

This unity endured until the Emergency at Dijon in 1170, when the Kingdom of Burgundy ceased to be a Drengot vassal; the empire was formally dissolved in 1191 and divided among the heirs and allies of Daniel IV.

The German Empire descended from the eastern half of the expansive Kingdom of the Franks after its scission in the ninth century, combining the Eastern Franks with Willemy. In its first centuries it expanded east and south; the kingdoms of Saxony and Bavarn became the empire's preeminent vassals, with their Andex and Houghbrocken dynasties ruling in turn.

By the end of the twelfth century, the northern cities were developing into the mercantile Stadbund and away from imperial authority. The slow erosion of the German Empire accelerated rapidly during the German Secession of the thirteenth century, and by the end of that century the fiction of a surviving German Empire was laid to rest with the corpse of the first Kingdom of Saxony.

The Second Roman Empire had existed since the (short-lived) reconquest of Rome from the Eastern Goths by Justinian I in 536; it would persist in some form for over a millennium. The eleventh and twelfth centuries did see the empire reach a territorial maximum, controlling territory from Corsica in the west to Derban on the Hazaran Sea in the east.

It was only in the late seventeenth century that the Second Roman Empire ceased to exist in any meaningful sense (despite several periods of only nominal continuity), due to a succession crisis and a series of dramatic civil wars.

The Single Caliphate stretched from Spain to Persia, and was the product of several centralisation reforms from Cairo consolidating authority over the various successor states to the Abbasid Caliphate (although the further territories such as Cordova or the Turkish lands were never as closely-ruled).

90.2: zar "serious"

zar /zar/ [zɑː]
- serious, committed, for keeps, risky, undertaken with something staked on the outcome;
- purposeful, deliberate, (of an act) not done lightly but instead with full regard of the possible consequences;
- meaningful, high-stakes, dramatic, tense, (of a narrative situation) there being a lot on the line that might be lost or not achieved;
- competitive, heated, rivalrous, antagonistic, (of a game) characterised by a strong desire to win on both sides or even of outright hostility;
- cutthroat, dog-eat-dog, with a ruthless focus on personal gain

also cair zar "to matter, be important, have consequences"

Etymology: from sixteenth-century zar "risky, high-stakes", transferred from the name of a gambling dice game. This comes via Napolitan zara from Arabic زَهْر (zahr) "dice". Doublet of hasart "peril, danger", which comes via French. Used exclusively of games and competitions until the nineteenth century, when the idiom with cair is first attested.

"Cay zar!" dis jo cant corrau nos.

dorangot /ˌdo.ranˈgɔt/ [ˌdo.ʀɐŋˈgɔt]
- overcoat, a heavy knee-length garment worn over other clothes as protection against bad weather

Etymology: from the eighteenth century, borrowed from Paris French dourangote "riding coat, overcoat". This is adapted from the now-obsolete Kentish term Durham-coat, named for the city in Northumber.

Jo sarrau voloppant y dorangot atorn.
/ʒo saˈro ˌvo.lɔˈpant i ˌdo.ranˈgɔt aˈtɔrn/

90.4: star luïscent a "have to do with"

star luïscent a /star ˌlaj.iˈxɛnt a/ [stɑː ˌla.jɪˈçɛn‿ta]
- have to do with, be related to, be relevant to, to have any bearing on (some person, topic, etc)

Etymology: idiom first attested in the fifteenth century, literally "to be playing at" and likely derived via the sense "to be participating in (some activity)". The participle luïscent "playing" comes from luïr "to play", which descends from a late Insular Latin lūdīre, lūdēscere "to play". These are both conjugational regularisations of lūdere in Classical Latin. See also the following idiom involving this construction:

Com es oc luïscent a ney ne Nivon? "What's that got to do with anything?"

...ney ne Nivon /ni ne niˈvɔn/ [ni ne nɪˈvɔn]
- general interjection in response to a perceived non sequitur, cf. English "What's that got to do with the price of fish?"

Etymology: literally "What does this have to do with snow in Japan?", first used in the nineteenth century and of obscure motivation; perhaps just in reference to the unlikelihood of snow in Japan affecting anything in Borland. The noun ney "snow" reflects Latin nix, nivem "snow", while the placename Nivon "Japan" is a sixteenth-century borrowing eventually from 日本, contemporaneously pronounced /niˈɸon/.

90.5: Sandrine

Sandrine (Merch /ˈsan.dɾəin/) is a soluble substance found in citrus and other fruits and vegetables. It is one of the substances essential to mammal life; a severe defect of sandrine is what causes scurvy.

(Do not confuse this substance with mandrine, a deadly poison.)

The curative effects of citrus fruits for scurvy were suspected as early as the fourteenth century. By the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, with the much longer geoscopic voyages following the Novomundine Landfall of 1471, efforts to prevent scurvy became more active. For example, King Ambrose III of Vascony (the 'Ascendant') instituted the Sandrine Design in 1485 by which ships would be required to stock dried fruits and syrups. This scheme, named for his sister Alexandra and the first European royal to set foot in the Novomund, is where the name sandrine originates.

However, such schemes did not have lasting effects. This was partly due to expense but much more significantly, due to the lack of understanding of the mechanism by which fruit prevented scurvy. Thus, fruit would be preserved in ways which removed their sandrine content (for example, boiling or use of copper vessels) and sailors would suffer scurvy anyway, leading guilds to abandon stocking fruits altogether.

Truly theoretic understanding would not come until the seventeenth century, when it was discovered by chance that the guy-coney can also develop scurvy (humans and guys are rare among animals in not creating sandrine in our bodies from sugar). This allowed for much more rigorous and time-efficient testing on guys, to determine what preparations of fruits and vegetables were effective at preventing scurvy. By the 1700s it had become common practice to stock lemon juice diluted with strong alcohol on long sea voyages.

- lodging house, boarding house, a building containing rooms for long-term rent and usually providing meals and cleaning;
- (a single) rented room in such a building

Etymology: collocation first used in the eighteenth century, from cambr "bedroom" and pijon "rent". The noun cambr "bedroom, quarters" descends directly from Latin camera "chamber, room"; the noun pijon "rent" descends from Latin pēnsiō "payment, pension".

Hamtour ny cambr pijon teyen dessur d'ogtant.

- in one's Sunday best, dressed to impress, wearing particularly formal or fashionable clothes;
- gussied up, tricked out, having many customisations or special features

Etymology: participle of arreloðeçar "to dress finely, to trick out", itself a verbal derivation from reloðeç "splendour; finery". This comes from reloð "fancy, refined", a descendant (with pleonastic re- seen already in the Vulgar period) from Latin lautus "washed; luxurious, splendid, fashionable".

91.5: Millstone War

The Millstone War (1897–1908) refers to the period of global military conflict often considered as the dawn of modern warfare. Though not all of the wars involved spanned the entire eleven years, they are all characterised by a fundamental asymmetry: defensive tactics had outstripped offensive technology, and so front lines worldwide ground to barely-moving trench fortifications.

The Millstone War marks the end of the Good Game period; its aftermath saw a comprehensive realignment of the previous system of alliances.

The last years of the Millstone War saw the first military use of aircraft, as well as air-bombing of cities including Marsella in Provence.

Political tensions rose globally in the decades after the Millstone War, as the inadequacy of the post-war settlements became apparent. In particular, relations between Drengot Collusion and their southern neighbours of Vascony and Provence quickly soured.

---

Honorine Maignard (fl. 1890–1940) was an author in France active for over fifty years in the early twentieth century. She was the granddaughter of the Lombard diplomat Audace Saviano, who during the Good Game period was instrumental in the formation of the Italian Concert.

During the Millstone War she served in the Second Medic Force of Valois for more than six years.

---

Vincent Margouille (fl. 1960–1990) was a Norman author and professional lineball player. In 1965 he led the Kent team to its only victory in the Lineball Global Tourney to date. He is the son of Vréqueu Margouille, who also played for Kent in the 1935 LGT.

From 1981 on, he authored his best-known series (beginning with Upstairs, Downstairs), which follows the people living in a manorhouse during the Good Game period. Later instalments portray their experiences during the Millstone War.

92.2: scagl a natur "the way of things"

scagl a natur /xɛil a naˈtɪr/ [çɛil a nɐˈtɪː]
- convention, the way of things, elements of society or the wider world considered innate and unchangeable;
- hierarchy, pecking order, a social economic or political system in which people or things are ranked and given corresponding status

Etymology: literally "nature's staircase", derived in the Middle Boral period from the Scholastic Latin scāla nātūrae "the Great Chain of Being" (literally, the ladder of nature). This is the theological concept of the hierarchy of all matter and life, thought by medieval Christianity to have been decreed by God, and adapted from similar ideas in Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy.

Often in the phrase step ny scagl a natur "part of the natural order of things, one's place in a hierarchy", where step "step, rung, foothold" is a borrowing from Old English.

- categorisation, classification, ranking, the process of arranging things into group determined by certain characteristics

Etymology: seventeenth-century noun form derived from ascreir "ascribe, impute, attribute, assign" by analogy with nouns like parceuçon "perception" from parcevir "to perceive". The verb reflects Latin ascrībō "I appoint, enrol, insert, add in writing".

92.4: rediveu "second-hand"

rediveu /ˌre.diˈvaw/ [ˌʀe.dɪˈvaw]
- second-hand, used, (of goods) previously owned by someone else;
- clichéd, hackneyed, unoriginal, repeated often enough to become tiresome;
- trite, cheesy, tropey, (of writing) unreflectively and unskillfully reproducing common narrative elements

Etymology: borrowing from Latin redivīvus "resurrected, second-hand" modelled on vīvus > Middle Borlish veu "living" (now obsolete). Metaphorical extension is seen from the late eighteenth century.

Jo stim y lasc rediveu cos outr.

92.5: Marsella

Marsella (Provincial /masˈseʎɔ/; Borlish Marsegl /maʀˈsijl/) is a city on the Middlesea [Mediterranean] and the capital of Provence.

History

A raid by itinerant Norman mercenaries sacked the city of Marsella in 946 N, nominally on behalf of the Malchassian Romans. As it happens, records of this raid contain the first unambiguous mention of identical triplets (Danes born on the isle of Mull around 915) in European history.

In the Second Tetrarchy period of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, Marsella was a major population centre in Burgundy within the First Drengot Empire.

During the Vascon Ascendancy, the region of Provence (including Marsella) was conquered by Vascony. Burgundy's reconquest in 1494 caused so much instability that the region rose up in revolt, sparking the 1497–99 War of Provincial Independence.

Newly-independent Provence led by Daniel Menton, Lord Amigòt, established Marsella as its capital. It is generally understood that he wanted to monitor the piratical allies of Barcelon who had ruled the city de facto for some time.

By the turn of the seventeenth century there were multiple weekly newspapers operating from Marsella. None of these remained in print until the modern day; the earliest extant publications—such as the entertainment and recreation newspaper Fiellas Dimenja—were incorporated in the nineteenth century.

During the Millstone War in the early twentieth century, Marsella suffered heavy air-bombing as part of the world's first such use of aircraft in wartime.

Today Marsella is famed for its midsummer celebrations which also commemorate the anniversary of its independence from Burgundy.

93.1: Leipzig Letter

excerpt in translation from the collected correspondence of Marian Siegert ~ Miller (1725–56), illegitimate daughter of Elias Villingen, second Duke of Far Suebia.

You were, as ever, entirely correct to insist on extra language tutors (and entirely too generous in letting me attend!).

The compulsory Latin has revealed itself less than useless—we run in the wrong circles—but the Dutch they have here is almost as awful as that of those Flemish performers we had some summers ago.

93.2: porrujonnar "protrude"

porrujonnar /ˌpɔ.ri.ʒɔˈnar/ [ˌpɔ.ʀɪ.ʝʊˈnɑː]
- protrude, stick out, jut, overhang to extend from a surface or boundary;
- impend, be imminent, to threaten to happen very soon;
- stick one's neck out, go out on a limb, to take a risk putting one in a vulnerable position

Etymology: Middle Borlish verbal derivation of porrujon "balcony, mezzanine" (at the time meaning "overhang, bulge, thrust"). This is from Old Borlish verb p(r)odrure "thrust forward, bulge out", from Latin verb prōtrūdō "I push forwards, I protrude". In metaphorical use, seen from the seventeenth century.

Carra je Naðal oc porrujonnant.

93.3: Eden soluð "a lost Eden"

Eden soluð /eˈdɛn soˈlɪθ/ [ɪˈdɛn sʊˈlɪh]
- lost Eden, Arcadia, Shangri-la, utopia, an imagined paradise of complete bliss and peace conceived of as being located in a distant past

Etymology: literally "an Eden that has been let go", an idiom first attested in Kigman's fifteenth-century poetry. The adjective soluð is the past participle of souvr "solve, let go, release, launch", which descends directly from the mostly synonymous solvō in Latin.

pog cossirn lorry liesc scholer la un Eden soluð.
/pɔj kɔˈsɪrn̩ lɔˈri ljɛx skoˈlɛr la ɪn eˈdɛn soˈlɪθ/

93.4: ðalleyar "spread-eagle"

ðalleyar /ˌða.liˈjar/ [ˌða.ljɑː]
- spread-eagle, stretch, to lie down with the arms and legs outstretched;
- luxuriate, bask, to enjoy some luxury in the manner of (for example) a sunbather

Etymology: from Middle Borlish ðalleyar "spread-eagle, to stretch taut", extended from its used in tannery to describe leather stretched out on tenterhooks. This reflects Old Borlish ðalȝar "to be attached to, to be fastened to", directly from synonymous adalligō in Latin.

Dou cat ern ðalleyant sou sol blanc.
/du kat ɛrn̩ ˌða.liˈjant su sɔl blank/

93.5: Lexember 2023 - 1: ceu "basically"

ceu /tsaw/ [tsaw]
- basically, essentially, pretty much, in effect, for all intents and purposes, not literally but sufficiently close that any difference is irrelevant;
- like, kinda, sorta, a filler word used to hedge a statement;
- (in negative sentences) hardly, barely, only just, to a minimal extent

Etymology: from Middle Borlish, original a legal term of art used to distinguish an act from a legally distinct act with the same consequences or punishment. In this use it was borrowed from Latin ceu "just like, just as if, as (if) it were". By the eighteenth century it had moved into general use, along with the innovated negative sense (originally restricted to the phrase ceu nien "barely anything, almost nothing").

Remanen ceu alcun toscivr ag platabac.

Sodrick (Merch /ˈsɔ.drɪk/, Welsh Heleð /heˈlɛð/) is a region of the Northwestern Isles comprising many small islands north of Wales and west of Scotland.

Toponymy
The name Sodrick was originally a demonym for the people of Soder (Old English Sodor), which descends from the Old Norse suðreyjar "southern islands".

History
Sodrick was settled during the Norse ascendancy of the eighth and ninth centuries, at the same time as Danes arrived on the shores of Albion and Ireland. Harald the Blue of Sodrick contributed to the establishment of the Kingdom of Scotland in the ninth century. Even the Welsh island of Mondwell was half controlled by Sodrick for some time after a partition agreed between Sodrick and Wynneth that was recorded in both the Ulstre and Carlile chronicles.

During the tenth century, the kingdom of Dunclothe under Roderick invaded and conquered many of the isles of Sodrick from the Danes, including Arran in 934 and (most significantly, as a power centre) the isle of Man in 942. The decline of Dane power in Sodrick has been connected to the decreased efficiency of obtaining wealth by raiding over time.

As Dunclothe took control of Sodrick, many fled or were expelled to places like Dane-ruled York and Ireland, or to relatively prosperous Normandy. Among their number is recorded the first unambiguous mention of identical triplets (Danes born on the isle of Mull around 915) in European history.

By the fifteenth century, Sodrick was subordinate to Wales, and it was incorporated as an outlying tallath of the Kingdom of Britain when it was formed.

93.6: gringlar "tumble"

gringlar /grɪnˈglar/ [gʀɪŋˈglɑː]
- tumble, topple, plummet, fall down, to descend in an uncontrolled way;
- be in freefall, crash, (of figures) to decrease rapidly;

Etymology: Middle Borlish borrowing from French gringueler "to tumble, roll down", itself from Dutch cring "circle, ring".

My trelamn a blad gringlau tout a coup.
/mi treˈlamn̩ a blad grɪnˈglo tut a kup/
[mi tʀɪˈlam.n‿a blad gʀɪŋˈglo tut a kup]

93.7: reunt "back"

reunt /rawnt/ [ʀawnt]
- back, to or in an earlier state or place;
- at odds, contrariwise, in a manner which contradicts something;
- once more, again, over, another time (especially when performing an action twice returns one literally or metaphorically to one's starting point)

Etymology: present participle of reuvr "come back, return, turn over, flip, do again, repeat". This descends via Old Borlish reouvre from Latin revolvō "I unroll, repeat", from volvō "I roll, tumble".

Y jonglour fey l'ig bal yemois reunt.

94.1: grindr "score"

grindr /ˈgrɪn.dr̩/ [ˈgʀɪn.dɐ]
- judge, rate, rank, evaluate, to estimate the worth of;
- score, grade, mark, to indicate the correctness of and give a score to (an exam, etc.);
- deliberate, decide between, mull over, weigh, to consider pros and cons in the course of making a decision;
- (slang) date, be dating, to go out and perhaps sleep with multiple people in turn often as a precursor to commencing a steady relationship

Etymology: from Old Borlish grindre, greindr "sift, separate, allocate, rank", which reflects a Vulgar Latin form *grēniō, grēnere "I sift, sieve, distinguish between". Despite the formal differences, by the semantics we can deduce that this is an altered form of Classical Latin cernō "I sift (etc.)" modelled on the perfect stem (cf. crēvī "I sifted", crētus "sifted, separated"). The initial voicing is sporadic, but shared with related noun grivr < cribrum "sieve".

Alcheðr my paðr ençau a grindr n'Avril.
/alˈkɛ.ðr̩ mi ˈpa.ðr̩ ɛnˈtso a ˈgrɪn.dr̩ naˈvrɪl/

94.2: moglastr "moist"

moglastr /mɔjˈla.str̩/ [mʊjˈla.stɐ]
- damp, moist, somewhat wet (usually to an undesired extent);
- (of the weather) damp, wet, miserable, as of the period between showers or shortly after rainfall;
- weepy, tearful, lachrymose, inclined to crying and sadness

Etymology: derivative of moglar "to wet, dampen, moisten" with the pejorative suffix -astr < Latin -aster "resembling, quasi-". This verb descends from Vulgar Latin *molliō "I soak, drench", related to mollis "soft, tender".

Nossy can am noc eir tras port candon cay moglastr.
/nɔˈsi kan am nɔk ir traz pɔrt kanˈdɔn ke mɔjˈla.str̩/

94.3: ranscellar "diverge"

ranscellar /ˌran.xɛˈlar/ [ˌʀan.çɪˈlɑː]
- branch, fork, bifurcate, to split into two as a path or a plant might;
- diverge, deviate, run apart, separate, vary, to tend to different directions;
- oppose, contradict, disagree, to hold different opinions or to imply different things

Etymology: verbal derivative of ranscel "branch, Y-shape, divergence", which reflects Vulgar Latin *rāmuscellum "little branch". This is a double diminutive of Classical rāmus "branch, bough, limb".

Dou rout ranscellau n'un bosc gauvn.
/du rut ˌran.xɛˈlo nɪn bɔx ˈgo.vn̩/

94.4: tars "clean"

tars /tarz/ [tɑːz]
- clean, wiped, scrubbed, having been cleansed by some means;
- blank, unmarked, devoid of markings such as writing;
- (of a facial expression) blank, emotionless, neutral, not revealing anything of one's true thoughts;
- sheer, utter, downright, absolute, unmitgated, offering no exception or qualification

Etymology: past participle of targr "to clean, wipe, scrub", descendant of Latin tergō (variant of tergeō "I wipe, polish"). In the last sense first seen in certain collocations like victoir tars "a runaway victory".

Jo sceu noc grap aïr all'outraç tars dell'ig bougr.
/ʒo xaw nɔk grap ɛjˈɪr ˌa.luˈtrats tarz dɛˈlaj ˈbu.gɾ̩/

94.5: ouç "silence"

ouç /uts/ [us]
- silence, peace, quiet, tranquility, the absence of sound;
- rest, repose, leisure, free time, time free from work or other duties

Etymology: from Old Borlish oç, ouç "leisure, ease, idleness", which reflects Latin ōtium "time free from activity, time avoiding activity". The shift to meanings directly involving the lack of noise had occurred by the sixteenth century.

Cay ouç ny majon livr.
/ke uts ni maˈʒɔn ˈli.vr̩/

Southbar (Borlish Sothbar /sɔθˈbar/ [sʊhˈbɑː]) is a region of Borland in the southwest of the island. Its largest population centre is the city of Axbane.
History

The petty kingdom of Southbar was founded by Anglian immigrants in the fifth century, along with Angland and several more minor kingdoms. It quickly established itself in opposition to Angland and to the rump sub-Roman Borlish state. At the turn of the ninth century it saw an influx of immigration from East Anglia after it was subjugated by Markland.

After an alliance between the First Kingdom of Borland and Angland and the Battle of Fendal (810), Southbar was forced to swear fealty as a subordinate kingdom.

Southbar held out for some time against the Danes after the fall of the First Kingdom of Borland, and even harboured the exiled King Jothey and his wife Brenna of Barrow. Nonetheless, by the end of the tenth century Sothbar had been incorporated into Dane Borland.

In the twelfth century Southbar had become a county. Its de facto seat was Axbane; by 1190 Count Steven is known to have resided year-round in the coastal town, bequeathing the old house in Heitriç to his younger brother.

94.6: cigl "boyfriend, girlfriend"

cigl /tsajl/ [tsajl]
- boyfriend, girlfriend, significant other, partner, one member of an unmarried romantic and/or sexual relationship;
- darling, dear, honey, baby, a generic term of endearment for one's lover

Etymology: from Old Borlish cigle /tsiɣlə ~ tsiʎə/ "trinket, tchotchke, proverbially worthless object", from synonymous *cīculus in Vulgar Latin. This is a diminutive from Latin cīccum "trinket", from an Ancient Greek form κίκκος which is probably imitative. Semantic drift to the modern sense (via the term of address) is evidenced from the eighteenth century.

My sour nil pausar ne parolar de sy cigl.

- downstairs, on a lower storey;
- downwards, lower, further down, below, at an inferior point along some space or scale;
- more specific, more particular, focused more on details or applying in fewer contexts

Etymology: redundant adjectival derivative of Old Borlish juss "below, further down", from late Insular Latin iūrsum, iūssum, a nonstandard form of Classical deorsum "downwards". In the latter sense extended by analogy to tauger "upstairs; more general".

Nos ayau paut ny refectoir jusser.

- guest, visitor, one present who is not a member of a given household;
- outsider, newcomer, unknown, unknown quantity, someone from whom one doesn't know what to expect;

Etymology: from Old Borlish frend, fremd, borrowed from Old English fremde "strange, foreign" (for the development of the coda compare hand "sex" < OE hǣmed "sex, cohabitation").

Teyen catorç frend ag tarn candon caye l'occijon.

The Celt population of Borland (self-described as the Bora Ale) is poorly documented. The few attestations of their language suggest only a recent divergence from the Briton tongue; they are thought to have arrived on the island from Albion, not directly from the continent.

95.2: spaiðoir "drawer"

spaiðoir /speˈðɔir/ [spɪˈðɔ.jɐ]
- drawer, compartment, an open-topped box that one can slide in and out of the cabinet that contains it;
- (figuratively) category, pigeonhole, box, one of several groups of things or people categorised by some means

Etymology: sixteenth-century derivative of verb spaiðar "slide, scrape" with the locative suffix -oir, which comes from -tōrium in Latin. The verb is an Old Borlish derivative of paið "floor, smooth surface", which directly reflects Latin pavītum "beaten, trodden upon" from paviō "I beat, ram, tread down". In figurative use the word is seen from the late eighteenth century.

Scey un spaiðoir scos ne sy tablaur.

- switch, toggle, button, a physical device that is pressed to (de)activate a mechanism (or a virtual representation of such a device);
- key, one of several small buttons corresponding to characters on a device for typing text

Etymology: from Old Borlish key, keȝ, caiȝ "toggle, dowel, pin for securing rope or fabric", a dialect form of stanard caiȝle /ke(j)ʎə/ (soon lost). This reflects Vulgar Latin cavicla (cf. French cheville, Venisian caúcia), from Classical Latin clavicula "bolt, bar, small key".

- channel, strait, a narrow band of water between two landmasses;
- (with definite article) the Kentish Channel, the strait between Albion and Gaul;

Roman Papacy

The Papacy in Rome is the spiritual seat of much of Christendom.

Despite intermittent conflicts with the Greek patriarchs and several abortive antipope lineages, the Roman Papacy remained the ultimate authority over all Christendom until the German Secession of the early thirteen century. This created a lasting competing seat in the Augsburg See which did not recognise the Roman Papacy's legitimacy.

The Great Fracture of the mid-sixteenth century severely diminished the temporal powers of the Papacy. While on paper the Pope in Rome remained an absolute ruler (along with political dominion over several smaller Italian and German provinces), in practice the new Triunvirato had political dominion over the city of Rome.

96.2: gehennar "embarrass"

gehennar /ˌʒe.hɛˈnar/ [ˌʝe.hɪˈnɑː]
- embarrass, humiliate, abash, discomfit, to disrupt someone's comfort;
- confuse, perplex, disconcert, bewilder, to bring into a state of confusion;
- inconvenience, discommode, to hinder the plans of

Etymology: borrowed along with noun gehen "embarrassment" from Middle French géhenne "humiliation, punishment". This reflects Old French gehine "reprisal" and gehir "to confess" (both from Frankish), respelt under the influence of unrelated Géhenne "Gehenna, Hell".

Mell'aldr son magn gehennant.

96.4: quallour "passenger"

quallour /kwaˈlur/ [kwɐˈlʊː]
- passenger, one who rides or travels in a vehicle but who is not the driver or a crewmember;
- hanger-on, tagalong, someone who accompanies without contributing much;
- side dish, a small serving of food meant to accompany a main course;
- epiphyte, a plant which grows on another for support but which does not obtain nutrients from it

Etymology: agentive formation from dialect verb quallar "to ride, travel by horse", which along with qual "horse" are nonstandard variants of covallar and coval in standard Borlish. These all descend from Vulgar Latin caballus "horse", from Gaulish. In latter usages clipped from compounds desc quallour "passenger meal" and plant quallour "passenger plant".

96.5: osceyan "birthday"

osceyan /ˌo.xiˈjan/ [ʊˈçjan]
- birthday, the anniversary of the day on which someone was born;
- birthday party, a celebration of somebody's birthday;
- (more generally) anniversary, a celebration of something lasting a number of years

Etymology: from Middle Borlish oscey-an "birthday celebration", literally "marks the year". The verb osceyar "to mark, commemorate" (now often specifically "to celebrate a birthday" by backformation) is a derivative of now-obsolete osc "notch, mark, tally". This noun is of obscure origin and presumably unrelated to osc "victim" < Latin hostia, although osceyar has on occasion been deliberately misinterpreted as meaning "victimise, prank, haze" for comic effect.

Je mell'osceyan jolleyaum nos ag scen.
/ʒe mɛˌlo.xiˈjan ˌʒɔ.liˈjom nɔz ɛj xɛn/

Revillon

Revillon (Borlish Reveglon /ˌre.vijˈlɔn/) is the Borlish term for the eve (and often the entire day) before Christide. It refers also to the specific cultural practice on the island of the Winter Feast (y Fest Reveglon), a celebration held on Revillon in churches across the land to which everyone in attendance brings food.

The Borlish name Reveglon means "vigil", and is a Middle Boral borrowing from the synonymous French reveillon, itself originally from Latin evigilō "I wake up". Earlier names include jolveisre (modern jolleistr "excursion, jaunt"), taken from Old Norse jólveizla "Yule feast", and fleðoul (of unknown ultimate etymology), both of which referred specifically to the celebrations.

Evidence of similar winter solstice festivities involving communally-prepared feasts on Borland predates even the Roman invasion, making Revillon one of the longest continuously-practised folk traditions in Europe (bearing in mind that the practice has evolved considerably with time). Third-century Roman historian Ammian Marcellinus provides us with an early written mention of the Winter Feast, which appears (under its original name Flidōlus, which gave the aforementioned fleðoul) in one of his asides on the Northwestern Isles. Post-imperial sources in the first millennium almost exclusively criticise the tradition as pagan and unholy; however, by the twelfth century the practice is fully appropriated by the Church.

Queen Natalia II of Borland abdicated on Revillon of 1894 as part of the political upheaval surrounding Borland's entry into the Drengot Collusion.

Food
Foods traditionally associated with the Revillon Feast include:

the tort dell'ivan /ˈtɔʀt ˌde.liˈvan/ ("child's pie", in reference to the Christ child), a savoury dish often of lamb. The practice of scoring a cross into the lid and hiding a small wooden object inside (traditionally also a cross) is a later innovation, but compare the similar galette des rois seen on the continent. This name for the dish is attested as early as the tenth century in Old Boral torte del ifan /tɔɾ.tə dɛl iˈfan/, although the modern recipe including lamb and potato is not seen in writing until the eighteenth century.
jonnovar zucarrað /ˌʒɔ.noˈvaʀ ˌzi.kaˈʀaθ/ "candied butterflies", a sugar-spiced cakebread particular to the island which ever since their earliest iterations have been generously spiced (usually with dalassine bark and inchroot). At this time of year they are formed into butterfly shapes, popularly thought to represent the metamorphosis of a dead winter into the new life of spring.

96.6: pascman "restaurant"

pascman /paxˈman/ [pɐxˈman]
- restaurant, eatery, diner, an establishment where people are served food;
- restaurateur, the owner of such an establishment

Etymology: from Middle Borlish (re)pascman "eatery", derivative of repasc "meal" with the vendor suffix -man < Old Borlish manc/ç "shop, vendor". The noun repasc reflects a Late Latin repāscō "I make food, cater", from Classical pāscō "I graze, feast".

Scey vigt vecin sart all'oc pascman.
/xi vajt veˈtsɪn sart aˈlɔk paxˈman/

- bundle, package, a group of objects held together by tying or wrapping;
- an unspecified but sizable number of things;
- lode, an unusual concentration of ore

Etymology: Middle Borlish diminutive of haç "bundle", borrowed in nautical use from synonymous haç in Vascon. This reflects Latin fascis "packet, package; burden, load".

Cosogr il taussan men an haçot a maus.
/koˈzɔjr̩ ɪl toˈsan mɛn an haˈtsɔt a moz/

tenguð /tɛnˈgɪθ/ [tɪŋˈgɪh]
- bauble, gaud, ornament, something showy used to decorate;
- trinket, trifle, tat, something small and inexpensive

Etymology: 18C Borlish, clipped from Sant Enguð "Saint Angith", a canonised medieval abbess from Sothbar on Borland. In the late medieval period her pilgrimage site was associated with freely-offered figurines and pieces of embroidered fabric.

Tenguð lousc jaint penoirn dy ci ranscel.

- overlook, to pretend not to have noticed or choose not to point out (a flaw);
- waive, remit, forgo, to relinquish a right or claim

Etymology: Middle Borlish borrowing from Latin ignōscō "forgive, pardon", perhaps influenced in some uses by similar-looking ignorar "not know, fail to perceive". Its conjugation is modelled on connoscr "to know of, to be familiar with".

My sour ignoy vondrous alcot sta y pegl meyon luy teissuð.
/mi sur ajˈnɔj vɔnˈdruz alˈkɔt sta i pijl miˈjɔn laj tiˈsɪθ/

J'oyeu y domn issar set viglour.

- discussion, dialogue, chat, conference, roundtable, any conversation intended for (possibly eventual) public consumption;

Britain

Britain (Cambrick Prydein) is a polity of Albion centred on Wales but extending through Devon and Dunclothe and out to Kernow and parts of Ireland.

History
The Kingdom of Britain was founded in the fifteenth century, formalising the suzerainty of Wales over the tallaths of Devon and Dunclothe. The state profited greatly from the Wars of Fealty of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries which raged across the rest of Albion.

Britain's economic success at this time drove ventures in Africa. Resupply ports along the western coast eventually allowed for the flourishing of direct sea trade between Europe and Asia.

The seventeenth century saw the dawn of British exploration of the Novomund, founding staddomains along the southern Gulf. These would coalesce into several polities known collectively as British Mendeva over the next centuries, the largest of which is Hasiny. Britain here found itself in conflict with Provence's settlements on the east coast; for example, the Sack of Santrafew was undertaken by an alliance of British and Mastoiset forces.

After the Chrysian Landfall, emigration from Britain (along with more formal state-building enterprise from Cathay) helped form the modern polity of New Leudong.

In the latter years of the nineteenth century, British Mendeva overtook Britain in population and industry. Nonetheless, Britain retained some cultural prestige over the Novomundine polities. In part this was sustained via migration of many members of the 'new rich' across the Atlantic, and the resultant intertwining of the respective upper-class societies through marriage. It is debated whether this prestige accelerated the export of Household Renovation social mores from Britain to Mendeva.

- impact, oomph, welly, clout, force, the power to have an effect on something;

egrtumnoir /ˌijr̩.tɪmˈnɔir/ [ˌɪ.jɐ.tɪmˈnɔ.jɐ]
- clinic, hospital, a small medical facility especially for the treatment of outpatients

(compare sanatoir "hospital, infimary, asylum", which refers to larger institutions)

Etymology: Middle Borlish, location derivative of egrtumn "illness, ailment, sickness". This reflects synonymous eȝrtumne in Old Borlish, from eȝr "ill, sick" (cf. obsolete modern egr "sick") < Latin aeger "sick" and -tumne "-ness" < Vulgar Latin -tūmine (related to Classical -tūdinem).

Y sanat all'egrtumnoir tein for dou.

- frenzy, fuss, tumult, commotion, clamour, ado, bustle, a general state of things or people being disturbed or riled up

- (theatre) upstage, the part of the stage furthest away from the audience

Etymology: originally in the last sense, from reðr "behind" and puy "aisle, balcony, walkway, gangway". This noun was borrowed from Old French puie "balustrade, balcony" (whence also English pew), from Latin podium "balcony in an amphitheatre". In extended use the word is attested from the eighteenth century.

98.5: Tachygraph

A tachygraph (Merch /ˌta.kɪˈgɾaf/, also informally a tachy or tacky /ˈta.kəi/) is a device with a keyboard for typing text onto paper, or more recently directly onto a slate.

Etymology

The word "tachygraph" originates in the mid-nineteenth century as a brand name. It is derived from Ancient Greek τᾰχῠ́ς • (takhús) "quick, fast" and γρᾰ́φω • (gráphō) "draw, write".

History

Early tachygraphs in the 1830s and 40s were extremely cumbersome, with most models only capable of setting type at a fraction of the speed of practised handwriting. The Armanburg Tachygraph (Tachygrafia Armangrod), which was commercially available in Poland from 1842, was so awkward to use that it was lampooned in the bit-sheets as the Bradygrafia (literally the "slow-writer").

Since very early on, attempts have been made to connect tachygraphs to the steeplemesh, so that one could type a message onto paper and simultaneously transmit a copy of the message to someone else (ideally, automating a tachygraph to type the message out also on the receiving end).

The first tachygraph specifically able to send messages on the steeplemesh was the Vilmanas Teleclavia, designed in Lithow by Tomas Vilmanas in 1859. Its first message (the first line from Ovid's Heroines, reproduced below) was sent on Michaelmas of that year to his friend Margreta Legaite in Tvaniste.

· A B C D E F G · HAEC TUA PENELOPE LENTO TIBI MITTIT ULISSE ·

99.2: vrogs "waist"

vrogs /vrɔjz/ [vʀɔjz]
- waist, the part of the body between the pelvis and the stomach;
- midriff, midsection, abdomen, the middle section of the torso below the chest;
- waistline, (the length of) a line around the body or an article of clothing at waist height;
- neck, pinch, a middle section of something that is narrower than on either side

Etymology: from Old Borlish vroȝse, vorȝse, voȝrse "waist; belt, girdle", showing extensive metathetic variation. This is thought to be borrowed from a Borland Kelt form vocris "belt" related to Classical Kelt crissus "shirt".

Scey zygom ag vrogs ny doit.
/xi ziˈgɔm ɛj vrɔjz ni dɔit/

99.3: luam "toilet"

luam /ljam/ [ljam]
- toilet, loo, a fixture used for urination and defecation;
- toilet, restroom, water closet, washroom, a (public or private) room containing such a fixture

Etymology: late eighteenth century, originally in university slang and then in euphemistic use, borrowed from the Latin verb form luam "I will wash, cleanse". Semantic transfer from the room to the fixture had occurred by the mid-nineteenth century.

Puns involving the homophony of luam "toilet" and l'yam "the uncle" < Old English ēam "maternal uncle" are attested from 1910.

99.4: hayennaç "homework"

hayennaç /ˌhɛ.jɛˈnats/ [ˌhɛjˈnats]
- workload, allocation, assignment, duties, the amount of work assigned to a particular worker;
- homework, additional schoolwork to be done outside of school

Etymology: pejorative derivation from hayen "task, duty, piece of work", borrowed from synonymous haiena in Vascon. This reflects Latin facienda "that which is to be done".

Alcun hom nil nis mettr ag hayennaç çaf.
/alˈkɪn ɔm nɪl nɪz ˈmɛ.tr̩ ɛj ˌhɛ.jɛˈnats tsaf/

100.2: aujon "magazine"

aujon /oˈʒɔn/ [ʊˈʝɔn]
- magazine, periodical, a non-academic publication comprising folded sheets attached together;
- assemblage, parade, display, gathering, a collection of people of things to be looked at;
- (military) muster, a gathering of troops for the purposes of inspection (or display, exercise, induction, etc.)

Etymology: originally in the last sense, a Middle Borlish adaptation of Medieval Latin ausiō "mobilisation, deployment, the readying of troops for battle". This is a noun from audeō "I dare, venture, risk"; the meaning passed via "(risky) manoeuvre, the act of putting (oneself or troops) in harm's way". Use outside of a military context is attested from the seventeenth century; in the (now most common) first sense it is attested from the early nineteenth.

100.3: caugtrbal "football"

caugtrbal /ˌkoj.tr̩ˈbal/ [ˌkoj.tɐˈbal]
- football, kickball, any of a number of sports in which a ball is passed from person to person by kicking it

Etymology: eighteenth-century compound from caugtrar "to kick" and bal "ball". The verb descends from Latin calcitrō "I strike with the heel", itself from calx "heel". Used predominantly of various amateur activities until the introduction of (multiple sets of) standardised rules in the twentieth century.

Lor luïsceum nos caugtrbal jos y loub.
/lɔr ˌlaj.iˈxawm nɔz ˌkoj.tr̩ˈbal ʒɔiz i lub/

100.4: ricottabr "funny"

ricottabr /ˌri.kɔˈta.br̩/ [ˌʀi.kʊˈta.bɐ]
- funny, humorous, hilarious, provoking laughter and mirth;
- witty, jocose, droll, waggish, showing ingenuity in an amusing way

Etymology: derivative via the -abr "-able" suffix of verb ricottar "laugh", itself a derivative of noun ricot "laugh, laughter". This is an idiosyncratic diminutive formation from Old Borlish verb rir "laugh" (now obsolete), from Late Latin rīdō "I laugh" (cf. synonymous rīdeō in Classical Latin).

Stou ty sour convoccar dec i's tan ricottabr.
/stu ti sur ˌkɔn.vɔˈkar dɛk ɪz tan ˌri.kɔˈta.br̩/

100.5: Voyage of the Phœbos

The Phœbos was a flagship of the Kingdom of Britain in the early sixteenth century. Having profited greatly at the expense of the other polities of Albion [Great Britain] during the Wars of Fealty, Britain under King Howel sought to extend its trade mesh past its posts down the west African coast, and trade with Asia directly by sea.

To this end, a coterie of ships led by the Phœbos (and itself captained by Martan mac Kellot) was tasked with sailing as far east as possible. After rounding Africa and making port in such places as Ungotia [Zanzibar], they were directed by Umanick [Omani] and then Chinese traders. Via Gurjat and Madray [1], they eventually arrived in Borune, at that time the southeasternmost land known in the Vetomund.

The Phœbos was thus present at the Great Borunesk Meeting of 1517. The ship's meeting with the Morrack ship the Cynthia in the port city of Sinquan is the definitive moment in the course of the Meeting, and it appears in several book and film adaptations. It is popularly assumed that the crews could not understand one another; in fact at least a dozen crewmembers of the Phœbos spoke some Arabic, as the British and Morrack trade meshes had overlapped for centuries.

Unlike the Cynthia, the Phœbos would not attempt to circumnavigate the globe; tales of the magnitude of the oceans ahead dissuaded mac Kellot from such a course.

101.2: raussið "backwards"

raussið /roˈsɪθ/ [ʀʊˈsɪh]
- backwards, backward, reversed, inverted, rotated or reflected so as to be in the opposite direction;
- unwilling, averse, reluctant, loath, not inclined or eager to do something;
- shy, timid, retiring, disinclined to social interaction;

Etymology: past participle of raussir "reverse, invert, flip". This is a motion verb derivation of now-obsolete raus "backwards", which descends via Old Borlish reaus, rears from Latin reversus "returned". In extended use the word is attested from the eighteenth century.

Jo sta raussið d'y vec vabian closnautr montar.
/ʒo sta roˈsɪθ di vɛk vaˈbjan klɔˈzno.tr̩ mɔnˈtar/

101.3: scroçabr "agonising"

scroçabr /xroˈtsa.br̩/ [xʀʊˈtsa.bɐ]
- agonising, painful, excruciating, torturous, causing extreme pain;
- harrowing, terrifying, nerve-racking, causing extreme fear or emotional distress;
- (sometimes proscribed) bothersome, exasperating, vexing, mithering, causing annoyance

Etymology: derivative of scroçar "to agonise, torment, vex", which descends directly via Old Borlish from synonymous excruciō "I torture" (related to cruciō "I crucify"). The last sense is disliked by some but is attested from the early nineteenth century.

Torn all'An ne Deganny interman un cainç scroçabr.
/tɔːn aˈlan ne ˌde.gaˈni ˌɪn.tɛrˈman ɪn kents xroˈtsa.br̩/

101.4: appragl phasm "television set"

appragl phasm /aˈprɛjl ˈfazm̩/ [ɐˈpʀɛjl ˈfa.zɐm]
- television set, an electronic device that receives and displays TV signals

Etymology: twentieth-century collocation, from appragl "device, machine, tool" and phasm "(the technology of) television, image transmission". The first component descends from Medieval Latin apparāculum "tools, equipment", a derivation of apparō "I prepare, equip". The second is a learned borrowing directly from Ancient Greek φάσμα • (phásma) "apparition, phantom, image".

Nossell'appragl phasm n'a ceu alcun grastum.

101.5: New Urban Mesh
 
The New Urban Mesh was an alliance of autonomous cities in Northwest Europe in the nineteenth century. Among its members were London, Conster, Axbane, Pentrose, Amstel, Anvers and Gant.

History
The Mesh emerged contemporaneously with similar political structures elsewhere, such as the Riverine Cities along the Danaw. This rise of such federacies of city-states has been attributed to the rapid population growth and expansion of cities in the run-up to the Global Workshop period. Several of the Mesh's cities were simultaneously also part of pre-existing polities (for example, Axbane and Pentrose were never legally independent from Borland).

The cities of the Mesh are popularly associated with wheeling-and-dealing policy, as well as aggressive and global use of espionage. However, the extent to which the Mesh was (for example) able to steer politics in the East to their trade benefit is likely overestimated.

In the late nineteenth century (ca. 1890), London led the Mesh to unite politically with the Drengot Collusion, at the time a nascent alliance of the French polities of Norman Kent, Paris and Burgundy. Whether it is more correct to say that the Mesh was subsumed into the Collusion, or that the Mesh took control of the Collusion, has long been a topic of heated debate.

References
Mr Desarden, Prince Consort (1968), a film based on the 1887 scandal around James Desarden, London's ambassador to Nackon Day. The affair is widely thought to have been politically motivated and a product of direct meddling from the Mesh.

The Jacobin Fraternity, historically also known as the Order of Saint James, is a religious organisation based in the city of Axbane on the south coast of Borland.

The Fraternity was founded in tenth-century Flanders under the patronage of Amelia of Bruges. In the eleventh century it was implicated in a local popular uprising against Drengot Emperor Geoffry II and forced to flee over the sea to Borland. There they built the Peninsular Monastery which still overlooks Axbane.

102.2: requïçon "weekend"

requïçon /reˌkwaj.iˈtsɔn/ [ʀɪˌkwajˈtsɔn]
- weekend, the (usually two-day) break in the working week often including a holy day of rest;
- (religion) day of rest, Sabbath day, the period set aside for rest and worship

Etymology: originally restricted to religious use, borrowed from Latin requiētiō "rest, repose" and modelled on verb requïr "to rest, be comforted". This descends from related verb requiēscō "I rest, am supported" in Latin. In the modern era the three weekends Fri-Sat, Sat-Sun and Sun-Mon are recognised by law in Borland (in line with the rest of the former Drengot Collusion and many other polities).

Jo vil molir an requïçon idoneyessem de my caf d'an posc.

brag /brɛj/ [bʀɛj]
- underpants, pants, undies, knickers, drawers, a short garment worn next to the skin and going ho higher than the navel
- (historical) breeches, trousers, a tightfitting garment covering the hips and legs

Etymology: original in the latter sense and in more general use, via Old Borlish braȝ from Latin brācae "breeches", from Gaulish. Used primarily for underwear since the late nineteenth century, in which sense it is clipped from now-archaic soubrag "underpants".

Zillapr stan sy brag embrostant.

bacaget /ˌba.kaˈʒɛt/ [ˌba.kɐˈʝɛt]
- cupboard, cabinet, a piece of furniture with shelves for storing cookware or food;
- closet, wardrobe, a similar piece of furniture for storing clothes

Etymology: Middle Borlish, from contemporary French metathetic variants bacaget, cabbagès "cupboard; lean-to, cabin, hut". The first part of this word is related to cabbas "basket; storeroom" < Latin capāx "spacious", while the second may reflect ajouster "to add" (in dialect form agestir) or jeter "to throw".

Nos depostau l'eç taflot an bacaget.

102.5: British Mendeva

British Mendeva refers to the polities of Mendeva which have undergone significant settlement from or otherwise been significantly influenced by the Kingdom of Britain. The region is mostly contained within the larger region of Gulf Mendeva. The polity of the region with the most population and global influence is Hasiny.

History

In the seventeenth century, exploratory voyages by ships of the Kingdom of Britain founded staddomains along the Mendevan Gulf, which would grow via settlement, treaty and conquest into the polities of British Mendeva.

The 'herdtale' tradition of storytelling which originated in nineteenth-century Mendeva was brought to wider recognition via several popular works published jointly in British Mendeva and Britain. Conversely, the masquira genre overtook the region later in that century following its popularity in the Vetomund.

British Mendeva overtook Britain in population and industry in the latter years of the nineteenth century. Nonetheless, for some time Britain retained a position of cultural cachet; it has been suggested this contributed to British Mendeva's rapid adoption of the ethics of the Household Renovation (as compared to much more ambivalent New Provence and Mashick, for instance) during this time.

Unlike earlier centuries, the nineteenth century saw significant transmigration of the élites between British Mendeva and Britain, as well as much more intermarriage. In part this can be attributed to the newness of an autochthonous élite west of the Atlantic, but mostly this is simply due to faster ships and greatly-reduced travel times.

103.2: hau "hi"

hau /ho/ [ho]
- hi, hey, hello, an informal greeting;
- hey, oi, a way to get somebody's attention

Etymology: in the first sense, a continuation of Middle Borlish hauð! "hello, good day", literally "health". The word hauð "health", now archaic, was borrowed in the Old Borlish period from synonymous hǣlþ in contemporary English. The form and informality of the greeting have been influenced by the second sense, which is probably of onomatopeic origin.

"Hau a toð gent," dis y giðour quaucant.
/ho a tɔθ ʒɛnt | dɪz i giˈður kwoˈkant/

103.3: yela "ciao"

yela /jeˈla/ [jɪˈla]

bye, ciao, an informal formula used by a speaker who is leaving; (archaic) goodbye, farewell, used also in formal contexts;
(sometimes proscribed) hello, hi, used also as an informal greeting

Etymology: via Middle Borlish yelað "farewell, goodbye" from Old Borlish vos ielað "may you fare well, be strong, abide, endure, persevere". This is a conjugated form of ieleir "abide, persist, persevere" (the would-be reflex yelir is obsolete by the fourteenth century), which is thought to reflect Latin haereō "I cling, adhere, remain fixed". As a greeting the word is attested from the early twentieth century.

I dis "Yela!" pre bouð souvr.
/i dɪz jeˈla pre buθ ˈsu.vr̩/

##

103.4: darfour "towel"

darfour /darˈfur/ [dɐːˈfʊː]
- towel, a cloth used for drying something wet;
- terrycloth, fabric woven with many protruding loops of thread which can absorb large amounts of water;
- (specifically) bath towel, cloth for drying one's body after bathing or showering;
- bathrobe, a garment made of terrycloth

Etymology: agentive derivation from darfar "dry out, cause to dry, desiccate", which reflects a presumed Vulgar Latin dēārefō "I dry out" related to Classical ārefaciō "I dry up, wither" < āreō "I am dry" (compare Portingale alfar "to be thirsty").

1. Which 14th-century historian first referred to the First Drengot Empire of three centuries earlier as the 'Constant Empire' in an attempt to link it to the District of Constantius (the unrelated part of the fourth-century Diocletian Tetrarchy ruling over Roman Brittania and Gaul)?

2. Name three international conflicts (not including the First German War) which took place during the 'Long Peace' period, here defined as lasting from 1770 until 1815.

3. Who wrote 1872 work 'An Incomplete Dictionary of the New London'? As the crowning example from the Futurism period of parachthon romance, it contains the first attestation of 'slate' for a screen displaying information, along with what other lasting coinages?

4. During which decades of the twentieth century did the Portingale Anarchy take place? Which legal developments of the prior years were abruptly reversed as a result of the breakdown of state control?

5. Compare the stability of the Christian states in the Holy Land before and after the Failed Crusade in the early thirteenth century. Which organisation had their authority over Antioch and Port Simon revoked by Pope Just in 1208, thus saving them from said debacle?

6. The Deviance movement has been credited with contributing to the decline of the Modest Arrangement through the first half of the nineteenth century, particularly in Gaul and Spain. To what extent is this narrative supported by the evidence?

104.2: cougt droccað "CD"

cougt droccað /kujt droˈkaθ/ [kujt dʀʊˈkah]
- CD, compact disc, an disc-shaped form of data storage read by laser

Etymology: literally "notched disc", attested from the late twentieth century as a calque of Cambrick coetan dolkiada "disc with indentations" (partly chosen so as to preserve the abbreviation CD). The noun cougt "disc, discus; annulus, quoit" is a Middle Borlish borrowing from French couite "discus, quoit, flat stone", of unknown further origin. The adjective is related to droc "notch, indentation", from Germanic.

104.3: veronic "plastic"

veronic /ˌve.roˈnɪk/ [ˌve.ʀʊˈnɪk]
- plastic, a synthetic solid hydrocarbon-based polymer;
- (historical, in particular) celluloid, any of a variety of thermoplastics created from nitrocellulose and camphor used as photographic film;
- spinelessness, passivity, obligingness, the willing to comply or change oneself without objection;
adj.
- plastic, made of plastic;
- spineless, passive, obliging, willing to comply or change oneself without objection

Etymology: 19C, former trademark also written as lacq Veronic "Veronic shellac". The word was borrowed from Medieval Latin veronīx "resin, varnish", perhaps from Byzantine Greek Βερενῑ́κη (Bereníkē), a city of Cyrenaica. In metaphorical use the word is seen from as early as the 1920s.

Tu scencau y soup n'un bacin veronic.

This is a borrowing via Old French from Medieval Latin hopla "gear, equipment; tackle", from Greek ὅπλᾰ • (hópla) "tackle; weaponry". Used for children's toys from the sixteenth century, for laughable people since the eighteenth, and in the last senses from the twentieth.

104.5: An Authorial Assortment

brief references for some writers previously mentioned in my worldbuilding notes.

Olexi Harchenko (fl. c19) was a Zahid Russian [1] author from the city of Boxa [~Novi Sad, Serbia]. He wrote the widely-translated mystery work Разгадто (Dénouement), whose title was borrowed into Italian as rasgatto "resolution, unravelling of a mystery", and from there into many European languages.

Thoffina'h Girmont (fl. 2005) is a British author who wrote Arthurian romance Y Ðreic o Redrɯth (The Dragon of Redrouth). The book is loosely based on the old tales codified in eleventh-century England (and reworked in post-Imperia Wales), but owes much more to the ahistorical reimaginings of the Long Peace [~1800] period.

Heudar Fiðaut (fl. c14) was a Borlish writer who is an important source of vernacular Middle Borlish texts. His most famous work is Catreðejnt Lagrem (Twenty-four Laments); his works together contain many first attestations of Borlish words (for example, graçant "merciful").

Tanasio Capretti (fl. 1970) was a theologian and humanist at the University of Florence. He wrote sociological work L'Inclusion Deviante di Conti Polari (The Deviance Incorporation of Folk Tales) to commemorate the 120th anniversary of the 1850 Laic Declarations of Belgrade, a landmark accord for secular governance in many polities.

Yollamaniza Elcabir (fl. 1943) was a Mashick [~Mexican] author and one-time spy. He wrote the spycraft novel La te Hozuho Sineton (No Slumber Will Seize Him) in 1943 partly based on his own experiences, in the aftermath of the Lovac Wars and the bombing of his home city of Moshtar [~San Francisco]. His writings were revealing enough that governments across Gulf Mendeva [Mexico Gulf states] issued warrants for his arrest.

105.5: Astraphor

Astraphor (also called barric force) is the set of phenomena associated with the presence and movement of plentiful substances, or the thrift that one can harness from such movement.

Etymology

The word 'astraphor' was coined in the seventeenth century to describe the theoretical source of the sparks certain substances (amber, fur, etc.) would create in darkness after being rubbed. It derives from Ancient Greek roots ἀστρᾰπή (astrapḗ) 'lightning' and -φόρος (-phóros) "bearing"; although the expected form would be 'astrapophor', even in the earliest texts we see only the shorter word (possibly due to transcription error).

The modifying form 'barric' derives from parallel work, and originates in Arabic بَرْق⁩ (barq) "lightning".

History

The deep theoretical connection between astraphor and light was explored thoroughly in the mid-nineteenth century; the unimaginatively titled magnum opus Astraphor and Light by Merch theorist Wexter Hathwall managed to fully characterise the mechanics of astraphor in a single equation.

At this time, the earlier flag-lamp steeplemesh was in the process of being displaced by barric meshes. Places without a pre-existing extensive flag-lamp system were in many cases faster to adopt the barric mesh; for example, by 1870 the world's longest wired post line on land spanned the length of Lower Mendeva.

The first undersea barric lines were laid in the 1850s in Kent (Dover to Cales), and from Texel in Willemy to Axbane in Borland, each distances of less than twenty leagues. By the following century hundreds of such lines crossed the world's oceans.

In the 1950s, the Mortar coalition in Portingale funded research into using threshold force to produce astraphor so as to reduce dependence on imports from the Drengot Collusion; by the 1960s the polity was a world pioneer in constructing threshold mills, becoming a net exporter of astraphor in 1971.

106.5: Axbane

Axbane (Borlish Ausbagn /ozˈbɛjn/) is a major city on the southwest coast of Borland. It is located at the narrowest part of the Rustigh Strait, less than twenty leagues from Willemy on mainland Europe.
Toponymy

Both the English and Borlish names descend from (the dative case of) the original Latin name for the city Aquīs Balneīs "to the bathing waters". Compare the city of Bath in Albion and of  (Grand-Aix /gʀãˈdɛis/, Aughen /ˈɔ.xn̩/) [Aachen] in Willemy.
History

As a Roman city, Axbane was home to an extensive bathhouse complex, for which the city is named.

With the German migrations of the early medieval period, Axbane was demoted to a minor port in the Anglian kingdom of Sothbar, which comprised the southwestern portion of Borland.

The Peninsular Monastery which overlooks the city was erected in the name of the Order of Saint James (the Jacobin Fraternity), which had fled to Axbane in 1067 after a popular uprising against Drengot Emperor Geoffrey II in Flanders. In the modern day, the Order remains a powerful presence, owning much land in the city and a successful series of breweries.

The Axbane of the late twelfth century is the de facto seat of the County of Sothbar; by 1190 the earl Steven (Steign) is known to have resided year-round in the coastal town, bequeathing the old house in Heitriç to his younger brother. At this time, the location of Axbane on one side of the Rustigh Strait was of immense strategic value. The Great Flie Flood of 1171 swept away much of Lower Frisland, and Axbane was for several decades afterward the obvious choice of harbour for any trader moving from the Danish lands through the Drengot domain and onward to Spain.

Axbane eventually became one of the star cities of the Corvine Concert, an association of mercantile cities in the region. The throughput of the Axbane port is thought to have accounted for over a third of European trade outside the Middlesea by 1400 N. The late fourteenth century also saw this Borlish city develop a particularly close relationship with Bremen.

The 1850s saw the Axbane-Texel undersea barric line, one of the world's first such steeplepost connections across the sea. At this time, Axbane was part of the New Urban Mesh along with independent cities like London.

107.2: autour "owner"

autour /oˈtur/ [ʊˈtʊː]

- bloc, alliance, confederation, federation, a group of states acting together and linked to a significant extent both politically and economically;
- pact, treaty, compact, agreement, a document with binding legal force conducted by subjects of international law

Borrowed from Latin collūsiō, noun derivative of collūdō "to collude, to secretly work (with someone) to the detriment of another". Nowadays used neutrally for alliance-federacies like the Drengot Collusion.

107.5: Grimmers

A grimmer (Merch /ˈgɾɪ.mə/, Borlish grimmour /gʀɪˈmuʀ/), formerly and formally an augrimmer, is a device that can be given methods to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations. These methods enable grimmers to perform a wide range of tasks. Grimmers are the substrate of the pistol mesh, which links together billions of such devices.

Calculating devices from the earliest abaci prefigure the grimmer, but its true potential (the ability to perform essentially arbitrary computation, given the correct instructions) arose from theoretic discussions on the possibility of self-replication. In the eighteenth-century, Rachel Desselut argued that in order for living matter to duplicate, its "Form" must contain a readable "Method" describing its construction. In this way she predicted the form-method separation essential to modern grimmer operation.

Etymology

The word grimmer is a clipping of augrimmer, literally "one who calculates, one who performs mathematical computation"; the word referred to a profession until the mid-twentieth century. This derives from noun augrim "computation, calculation", which originally meant "calculation using Arabic numerals" in particular, and which was a loan via French augrisme from Medieval Latin algorismus. This reflects the name of Persian mathematician al-Khwarismi, whose works introduced the positional number system to Europe.

108.4: arrhenosarc "androphilic"

arrhenosarc /aˌre.noˈzark/ [ɐˈʀe.nʊˈzɐːk]
- androphilic, characterised by (sexual or romantic) desire towards men or aesthetic appreciation of the male form;
- (male) homoerotic, suggesting or arousing a homosexual desire between men;
- (attributively) beefcake, pertaining to imagery of men presented as sexually desirable

cf. thelusarc "gynophilic, etc."

Etymology: nineteenth century coinage from Ancient Greek, originally used in artistic criticism to discuss current trends in painting and sculpture. The term derives from ἄρρην (árrhēn), Attic variant of ᾰ̓́ρσην (ársēn) "male, masculine", as well as σάρξ (sárx) "flesh, lust". Both gendered forms appear to have been coined at roughly the same time.

108.5: Tommarth

Tommarth (Merch /ˈta.məθ/) is the capital and largest city of Markland. It had a population of over 5 million people by the year 2010. The dialect of Merch spoken by many in Tommarth is widely considered a standard to emulate.

The area was settled by the Angles in the sixth century; by the ninth it had become the primary city of the nascent Merch Kingdom. It was fortified significantly over the next centuries in defence against the Welsh to the west and then against the Danes to the East.

By the modern day Tommarth has an extensive underground rail system known locally as the Dusker, with stops including Kibbrough and Cathedral.

Toponymy

The city takes its name from the Tome river on which it stands. Formerly (before the modern spelling reform) spelt Tomwarth, the local area was known in Old English as Tomworðig "enclosure, field by the Tome."

Institutions

D'Aumesty Tellard Guild (fl. 1849), organisation of cartographers
Lady Maud Orchestra (fl. 1976), professional group of musicians receiving public funding

Royal Tommarth Castinghouse (fl. 1930), publisher of nonfiction which once held great cachet but latterly of no particular merit
Tommarth Open School of History (fl. 1997), known for publishing reference works

The Romantic period was characterised by great infrastructure projects. For example, the Bordew-Audaz canal was completed in 1679, connecting the Atlantic and the Middlesea without having to pass through Morrack-controlled seas.

109.2: duvar "cheat"

duvar /diˈvar/ [dɪˈvɐː]
- cheat, connive, to violate the rules (of a game) in order to attempt to gain an advantage;
- sidestep, dodge, evade, duck, to get out of the way so that something cannot hit (or metaphorically, negatively affect) you;

Etymology: direct descendant of Old Borlish duvar, dufar "to duck, dip, lower oneself; to plunge into water", which was borrowed from Old English dyfan "to dive, submerse". In its ludic sense it is attested from the seventeenth century.

Jo saveu mell'amig er duvant a scac.

109.3: impar "unlike"

impar /ɪmˈpar/ [ɪmˈpɐː]
- unlike, different from, not in a similar manner to;
- in contrast with, as opposed to, considered as differing from;
- disagreeing with, contradicting, not according to

Etymology: Middle Borlish legalese borrowing from Latin adjective impār "unequal", and used as a preposition almost as quickly by analogy with par "by, through, (archaic) according to" < Latin per "through".

Impar my fraðr j'am l'oç pascman a manoscart.
/ɪmˈpar mi ˈfra.ðr̩ ʒam lɔts ˌpaxˈman a ˌma.noˈxart/

##

109.4: sobot "radio"

sobot /soˈbɔt/ [sʊˈbɔt]
- radio, the technology of transmitting messages via radio waves;
- radio, an apparatus for transmitting such messages

Etymology: 1910, backformation from the somewhat-earlier adjective (1904 boðour sobottal "radio transmitter", 1907 œculux sobottal "radio waves"). The technology having been invented in Hasiny, the word was borrowed indirectly (probably via Vascon) from Hasinick Welsh sobotał "signal, message". This in turn comes from Jaughta çobota "smoke; message", after the practice of sending signals via smoke.

Par y sobot coum nos addoit dy cainç.

109.5: Guillen daus Sanz

Guillen daus Sanz (b. ca. 1450, Provincial /giˈʎẽj daus sɐ̃ts/) was a strategist in Provence in the years leading up to the War of Provincial Independence, and became a powerful political figure in the decades afterward.

Born a foundling (the surname daus Sanz "of the Saints" was widely given to children in orphanages at the time), he joined the (then-Burgund) army at a young age and rose to the position of general after receiving the patronage of Daniel Menton, Lord Amigòt.

It was on the advice of daus Sanz that Lord Amigòt was able to secure the aid of King Marc V of France; France had reconciled with Normandy to avoid the tangle that was the Albion Wars of Fealty. With this support, he and several other noble families declared independence from Burgundy on the twenty-first of June, 1497 (which to this day is a national holiday in Provence).

The following quote is popularly attributed to daus Sanz on the eve of the Battle of Margès (1499). It mocks the states of Albion which had been embroiled in the Wars of Fealty for the past two decades.

Perhaps we should have sent for a Kentish witness! They might learn the subtle craft of ending the wars they start.

After Daniel Menton's rule over independent Provence ended in 1517, his cousin Antoin was elected by the Concert under the close attention and martial guidance of daus Sanz.

Fort daus Sanz, a military base in Provence in active use during the mid-twentieth century, was named for Guillen daus Sanz.

This period sees the establishment of several alliance-federacies that would go on to define the geopolitics of the twentieth century, such as the Drengot Collusion in north-western Europe (whose expansion concluded in 1894 with the accession of Borland).

The perception of the Good Game period as a time of glamorous espionage and political machinations behind closed doors is not entirely deserved—compare the popular perception (via books and film) of the 1887 Desarden affair involving a London ambassador and the king of Nackon Day with the tawdrier reality.

Nevertheless, the period has cemented itself as a popular setting for spycraft and masquira stories.

##

110.2: plouç "screen"

plouç /pluts/ [pluts]
- screen, windbreak, a moveable (often folding) barrier;
- disguise, camouflage, guise, concealment, anything that serves to hide something from view;
- front, cover, façade, the public-facing version of something concealed for personal or legal reasons;
- act, persona, show, an intentional and false impression of oneself

Etymology: originally restricted to the first sense, a direct descendant (or via Old French, but the cognate plouce "shutter" is unattested before the twelfth century, and may instead be from Borlish) of Latin pluteus "railing; screen; bookcase". Metaphorical extension to other forms of concealment is attested from the Middle Borlish poetry of Kigman in the fifteenth century.

Jo sceu y moment veir de ty plouç souvr.

110.3: massour "jaw"

massour /maˈsur/ [mɐˈsʊː]
- jaw, jowl, the part of the face below the mouth;
- jawbone, mandible, the bone of the lower jaw;
- vice, clamp, tongs, grip, any tool comprising two parts which close together to hold something in place

Etymology: Middle Borlish masçour "jaw(bone)" respelt in the 1870 reform, agentive derivation from masçar "chew, bite down on". This straightforwardly reflects post-classical Latin masticō "I chew", from Greek. In non-anatomical use the word is attested from the sixteenth century.

I me dau ðorn tranq ag massour.

110.4: n'oc hour "for a while"

n'oc hour /nɔk ur/ [nʊˈgʊː]
- for a while, for a short time, awhile, from now until a point not far in the future;
- for now, provisionally, temporarily, presently, at the moment but likely not for long;
- (sometimes proscribed) soon, imminently, about to occur

Etymology: sixteenth-century idiom, literally "in this time". The preposition and demonstrative n'oc < Latin in hōc "in this" co-occur also in other contemporary idioms like n'oc ort "upwards, with an upwards motion". In the last sense the phrase is still sometimes proscribed, despite attestations going back over two hundred years.

110.5: Redstone Chair

The Redstone Chair (Merch Redstoan Sete /ˈɾɛd.stoːn ˈsiːt/) was a wooden throne used by the monarchies of Albion during the medieval period.

History

The Redstone Chair was fashioned in the late tenth century around a block of sandstone; the name of the carpenter is forgotten. This block was (allegedly) the block upon which the Elved Marriage between a princess of Markland and the ruler of Dane Northumber was solemnised, ending hostilities between the two polities for almost a century.

Many subsequent monarchs of Albion, and especially of Markland and Northumber, were crowned on the Redstone Chair. During the Second Tetrarchy of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, most of the Drengot Emperors sat upon the Chair, and as such it was relocated to London. After the Empire's collapse, this placed the Chair in the politically turbulent region between Markland and Kent. Some historians have conjectured that the First Burning of London in 1290 was in part motivated by a plan to acquire the Chair; the responsible party varies in the telling.

According to the traditional account, it was a dispute over the location of the Redstone Chair which sparked the Wars of Fealty, which lasted almost fifty years over the turn of the sixteenth century and which embroiled almost all the polities of Albion.

Unfortunately, the Chair was lost in the tumult of the wars at some point between 1505 and 1509. Despite several searches and at least two hoaxes, the Chair has never been recovered, and the modern understanding of its appearance rests entirely on depictions in a few portraits and coronation scenes.

111.2: guy "guinea pig"

guy /gaj/ [gaj]
- guinea pig, mammal of the genus Cavia;
- (obsolete) fool, simpleton, a mindless person;
- (archaic) greenhorn, novice, beginner, an inexperienced person;
- dude, bloke, chap, a man and especially a younger man

Etymology: a clipping of fuller laprot guy (/laˈprɔt ˈgaj/ [lɐˈpʀɔt ˈgaj]), literally "guy-coney". This is a seventeenth-century calque of Vascon conill guy (/gi/; the earlier /gwi/ was altered by analogy to the unrelated name "Guy"), which comes via Morrove [Maghrebi] Arabic from Run'allo [Quechua] quwi "(female) guinea pig". In its derogatory senses it is attested from the late eighteenth century; as a general term for young men, from the mid-twentieth.

bonaventur /ˌbo.na.vɛnˈtɪr/ [ˌbo.nɐ.vɪnˈtɪː]

Etymology: a borrowing via a French language (in which the semantic shift occurred) from Lombard bunaventura "good fortune, luckiness".

a gest /a ʒɛst/ [ɐˈʝɛst]
- de facto, in practice, in fact, regardless of official or legal status;
- actually, in fact, used to introduce a contradictory remark

Etymology: a Middle Borlish borrowing from legal Latin ad gestum "de facto", literally "to the deed", along with parallel formation a verb < ad verbum "de jure", literally "to the word". In general contexts it is seen from the sixteenth century.

A gest, aucel son progenies jug dez dragon.
/a ʒɛst | oˈtsɛl sɔn ˌpro.ʒeˈnjɛz ʒaj dɛz draˈgɔn/

111.5: Battle of Rexam (1483)

The Battle of Rexam (Merch Feight at Rexam /fɛʃt ət ˈɾɛksəm/, Cambric Brwydr Car Vanteł /ˈbɾuː.də kaː vənˈtɛɬ/) was a major combat between Markland [~Mercia] and the Kingdom of Britain [~Wales+] which took place in 1483 during the Wars of Fealty.

Rexam (formerly in the Merch language spelt Wrexham) had been a contested town on the border of Wales and Markland almost from the moment the latter was founded. In 1301, in an act which reignited the Mallor Wars, King Andrew II sacked the town.

The relatively-new Kingdom of Britain (formed of Wales and its outlying tallaths [provinces], along with Kernow [Brittany] and Sodrick [Man and the Hebrides]) started from a position of strength, and managed to extract many concessions from Markland in the early years of the wars. This culminated in a decisive victory at the Battle of Rexam, where the last Duke of Chester was killed.

After this battle, Britain was able to take lasting control of the area around Rexam (though the attack on the city of Chester shortly thereafter was rebuffed). The polity then managed to recuse itself from the continued conflicts of the Wars of Fealty; the rest of the polities of Albion would remain embroiled for another thirty years.

The battle and its aftermath were portrayed in 1931 work "Children of the Battle of Rexam" (released originally in Cambric as Pa Ðywdon y Plant Car Vanteł "What the Children of Car Vantel Said"), a fictionalised account of the three orphaned children of the Duke of Chester written by schoolteacher Jon Paldreth.

112.2: imminent "prospective"

imminent /ˌɪ.miˈnɛnt/ [ˌɪ.mɪˈnɛnt]
- projecting, overhanging, suspended above;
- prospective, anticipated, likely or expected to happen;
- newly elected, (of a candidate) voted in but having not yet taken office;
- apparent, (of an heir) having a claim to a title that cannot be superseded by the birth of anyone else

Etymology: Middle Boral borrowing from Latin imminēns, present participle of immineō "I overhang; I am intent upon, I am near at hand". The verb imminir was briefly current but had obsolesced by the end of the seventeenth century. Its original use in Borlish was in the phrase heriter imminent "heir apparent", as opposed to heriter provisoir "heir presumptive".

My paðr es collocquant con y gournour imminent.

112.3: sou teneur covart "in secret"

sou teneur covart /su teˈnawr koˈvart/ [su tɪˈna.wɐ kʊˈvɐːt]
- in the dark, under the cover of darkness, without any light;
- in secret, secretly, out of view, sub rosa, concealed from any eavesdroppers or spies

Etymology: idiom attested from the eighteenth century, literally "under covered darkness"; probably formed by analogy to preexisting sou ciel ovart "in plain view", literally "under open sky". The noun teneur is an uncomplicated descendant from Latin tenebrae "darkness"; the adjective covart is the past participle of covrir "to cover", from Latin cooperiō "I cover, overwhelm, clothe".

Il son se rajognent sou teneur covart pieç semman.
/ɪl sɔn se raˈʒɔj.nɛnt su teˈnawr koˈvart pjɛts sɛˈman/

112.4: abrangir "include"

abrangir /ˌa.branˈʒɪr/ [ˌa.bʀɐnˈʝɪː]
- include, comprise, comprehend, to consider a part of some set of things;
- span, cover, contain, to extend sufficiently so as to include

Etymology: via Scholastic Latin abrangeō "I include" from Portingale abranger "include", itself of obscure origin. Possibly related to Old French rengier "to line up, form rows", from Frankish (either hring "ring" or ranc "upright"); otherwise perhaps an unconventional descendant of Latin vergō "I bend, am situated".

Y pascman abrange zaquesc e desc assovent y dou.

raspar /raˈspar/ [ʀɐˈspɐː]
- scrape, scratch, graze, grate, rasp, to draw a sharp or rough object along a surface while exerting pressure;
- play, bow, to create sound on a string instrument by means of drawing a bow across a string

Etymology: twelfth-century borrowing from Old French rasper "scratch, grate", itself from synonymous hraspōn in Frankish. The extension to string playing, as well as the noun raspour "string player", is seen from the late sixteenth century.

J'yemoy scið aïr kes raspað demay sad.
/ʒjeˈmɔj xɪθ eˈjɪr kɛz raˈspaθ deˈme sad/
[ʝɪˈmɔj çɪ‿ðɪˈʝɪː kɛz ʀɐˈspɐh dɪˈme sad]

113.3: parcorrir "scan"

parcorrir /ˌpar.kɔˈrɪr/ [ˌpɐː.kʊˈʀɪː]
- scan, examine, go over, skim, to look at sequentially or from one end to the other;
- traverse, cross, to go through;
- rehearse, to practise by acting out

Etymology: Middle Borlish borrowing from Latin percurrō "I run through; I look over", modelling on inherited par- "through" and corrir "to run". In the last sense it is attested from the eighteenth century.

Nos erau y fabr parcorrent set hour.
/nɔz eˈro i ˈfa.br̩ ˌpar.kɔˈrɛnt sɛt ur/

souvolar /ˌsu.voˈlar/ [ˌsu.vʊˈlɐː]
- sweep, be swept, to be caused to rise up into the air from the ground (as of the clothing of a person spinning, or of dust);

- go along with something, play along, to cooperate in continuing something by passively allowing it;
- (in a performative context) yes-and, commit to the bit, take things in stride, go with the flow, stay in character

Etymology: borrowing from Latin subvolō "I fly upwards from below", adapted to existing sou- "under" and volar "fly". In metaphorical use the word is attested from the eighteenth century; in a theatrical context it is seen from 1888, originally in use by a specific school of acting in Axbane.

Y rimband ag fruyour souvolaurn apar.

113.5: Delicious Etymology

excerpts in translation from the Rotcham Veriloquy, the premier etymological dictionary of Merch. It has been published in several editions since the late nineteenth century via the press of the university of Rotcham [Rochdale].

114.2: xivol "waltz"

xivol /ksiˈvɔl/ [ksɪˈvɔl]
- waltz, xivola, a style of dance originating in Vascony during the Long Peace (1770–1815) characterised by triple time and a rapid tempo;
- metaphorically, the state of many people simultaneously carrying out independent tasks and moving around each other without getting in each other's way

Etymology: via French xivole from Vascon xìvola /ˈʃi.vo.la/ "waltz". This itself is a borrowing from the earlier and slightly different Italian dance scivola "waltz, word stressed on the third-from-last syllable", from verb scivolare "glide, slip". This is plausibly a descendant of Latin exsībilō "I hiss forth".

Although the original xivola dance had a rather restrained tempo, the average performance speed of xivola music has greatly increased over time. Xivola is usually conceived of as a crowd dance, in which an entire roomful of people participates.

Sy xivol aye tug aglon de skisteç.
/si ksiˈvɔl ɛˈje taj ɛjˈlɔn de skɪˈstɛts/

114.3: trave "parquetry"

trave /traˈve/ [tʀɐˈve]
- parquetry, the technique of using wooden tiles to create geometric patterns especially as used in flooring;
- jigsaw, tangram, a puzzle in which the aim is to reconstruct a picture or shape that has been cut into small pieces

Etymology: from a specialised use of Middle French travé "crossed with wooden beams", via noun traf, tref "beam, mast" from Latin trabs "timber, beam, rafter". The puzzle sense is attested from the late nineteenth century.

Il son y trave costroint toð y jorn.
/ɪl sɔn i traˈve koˈstrɔint tɔθ i ʒɔrn/

114.4: soumoin jair "reference"

soumoin jair /suˈmɔin ʒer/ [sʊˈmɔin ʝeː]
- reference, cite, to quote the words of another with attribution;
- credit, shout out, acknowledge, to publicly mention someone especially in order to thank them

Etymology: idiom meaning "to throw reference" attested from the seventeenth century. The noun soumoin is a deverbal of soumonir "prompt, remind", which descends from Latin summoneō "I privately advise, give a hint". The verb jair comes from Latin iaciō "I throw, fling".

Nos veleu soumoin jair a nossy conemour.
/nɔz vɛlaw suˈmɔin ʒer a nɔˈsi ˌko.neˈmur/

114.5: On the Bookshelf

In Sickness and in Health: Medicine in pre-Arnoutszen Europe is a quire chronicling the development of medical practice in Europe from antiquity until the time of physician Laurz Arnoutszen in the sixteenth century (the adoption of whose techniques constituted a sea-change in the effectiveness of medicine). It was written by Andrew Knowles in the mid-twentieth century. It was published in Kent by Winchester Scholastic Primers in multiple editions; the second edition was released in 1961 with a foreword by Dr Laura Norris, a lecturer in Heredity at Canterburgh University.

New Skies, Old Stories (originally published in Provincial French as Novè Cial, Anzan Conte) is a work of popular history detailing the origins of the various threads of parachthon fiction. It was written by Simon d'Estiala and published by Prindor Marsillès in 1980. Its thesis is that many of the tropes often considered to have been invented by particular parachthon authors are in fact simply examples of existing tropes used in new settings.

Men in Black (originally published in Parisian French as Hommes en Noir: une Étoire d'Espionnage) is a layperson's account of the history of spycraft across the world. It was written by Agathe Bisset and published by Paris University Editions in 2003.

The Alphabetical Albion is an encyclopaedia of the political history of Albion. It was written by a consortium of authors including Lucas Osborne and published by Winchester Scholastic Primers in 1920. The book organises itself into twenty-six sections, one for each letter of the English alphabet in order, with varying levels of contortion required to justify the conceit. Headings include "F: The Wars of Fealty", "Q: Unanswered Questions" and "X: The Necessity of Xenia".

Originally conceived by the two administrations in concert in 1943, the endeavour was delayed several times due both to budgetary concerns and, of course, the outbreak of war. The cable connects the cities of Gadire on the river Soux [Agadir, Morocca] and Paratzon in eastern Brasil [St John's, Newfoundland].

115.2: trasson "transit"

trasson /traˈsɔn/ [tʀɐˈsɔn]
- transit, crossing, an instance of something moving across or through something else;
- transition, change, the process of change from one state to another;
- link, bridge, connection, anything placed between two distinct sections

Etymology: formerly trasçon, either a Middle Borlish noun derivation from trasir "to cross, traverse", or a direct borrowing from Latin trānsitiō "transit, transition". In the last sense the word is attested from the seventeenth century, originally applied to parts of musical compositions.

Jo passau y trasson nell'exedr a quarvol.
/ʒo paˈso i traˈsɔn ˌnɛ.lɛkˈsɛ.dr̩ a kwarˈvɔl/

115.3: exedr "waiting room"

exedr /ɛkˈsɛ.dr̩/ [ɪgˈzɛ.dɐ]
- antechamber, anteroom, forecourt, vestibule, entrance hall, a room between the outside and the main interior of a building;
- (historical) exedra, a small room for discussion lined with benches;
- waiting room, lounge, a space inside a public for people to sit and wait (especially a particularly well-appointed or luxurious such space);

Etymology: an early modern borrowing from Latin exedra "discussion hall with seating", itself from Greek ἐξἕδρα "an exterior sitting place". In the last sense it is attested from the nineteenth century, originally in reference to such rooms in train stations.

L'exedr n'a alcun vivirc por asseïr.
/lɛkˈsɛ.dr̩ na alˈkɪn viˈvɪrk pɔr ˌa.siˈɪr/

##

115.4: quarvol "airport"

quarvol /kwarˈvɔl/ [kwɐːˈvɔl]
- airport, an area designed for landing and takeoff of commercial passenger aircraft

Etymology: early twentieth century, portmanteau of quarvet "(bus, taxi, ferry) station, a stopping place for transportation" and vol "flight". The noun quarvet is a diminutive of quarf "docks, harbour", borrowed in the Old Borlish period from Old English hwearf "embankment, wharf". The noun vol is a deverbal from volar "fly", from Latin volō "I fly".

Cay l'oc convey visað ag quarvol?

115.5: Turbulent Times

collected notes on various events and periods which took place at the time of the Long Peace (ca. 1770–1815).

The Decadence of Belgrade refers to the Kingdom of the Danaw [Danube] in its final decades before the Second German War (1815–23) and the subsequent dissolution of the state. The Decadence also represents the territorial maximum of the kingdom, having wrested Bulgary [Bulgaria] from the suzerainty of the Second Roman Empire [~the Byzantines] after the latter's final collapse in the seventeenth century, and more recently having consolidated control over lands at the northwestern border with Bavarn [Bavaria].

The Mendevan Unmooring (Borlish Deshormejanç Mendevan /deˌzɔr.meˈʒants ˌmɛn.deˈvan/) is the collective name for the various wars and diplomatic developments at the turn of the nineteenth century which led to the weakening and sometimes severing of formal ties of polities in Mendeva [North America] from those in the Vetomund [Old World]. The more explosive conflicts such as the War for Ambrosia [~east and north of the Great Lakes] and the Hasinick Revolution [~lower part of the Mississipi watershed] (against Vascony and Britain, respectively) often overshadow quieter events like the Departure of Mashick [~Mexico].

The Romantic Revival (Borlish Resorgenç Romannesc /reˈzɔr.gɛnts ˌro.maˈnɛx/) was an artistic and political movement which arose towards the end of the eighteenth century. It was characterised by optimistic portrayals of heroism, and especially a belief in a 'brighter past' in the seventeenth century that could be recaptured. It is due to this movement's depiction that a loose congeries of wars in the mid-seventeenth century have become known as the Romantic Wars.

116.1: Fun-loving Firefighter

excerpt in translation from Mescainç ben Delit? "Accident or Crime?", one of a series of episodic stories about first responders in Damvath, published since the 1990s by a collective of Borlish authors.

Zaf er denuð quïscour dec apar l'aye l'occajon a foyaçar eð a gent aïðar veg temporane.
Zaf had become a firefighter because it let him show off and help people at the same time.

He still got the same rush from hearing the alarm, from driving the engine with its brilliant lights and screaming noisemakers, from kicking in doors—people's worst days made him feel alive.

Someone more prone to self-reflection might have felt qualms about that.

116.2: ðar "farming"

ðar /ðar/ [ðɐː]
- farming, farmwork, agriculture, tilth, the business and activity of cultivating land and raising livestock;
- (in certain idiomatic expressions, more generally) work, toil, labour, drudge, any particularly strenuous activity;
- (colloquially) sex, intercourse, the act of having sex with somebody

Etymology: Middle Borlish deverbal from ðarar "plough, till; farm; labour", originally restricted to crop production and not animal husbandry. This descends uncomplicatedly from Latin adarō "I plough, till". In the last sense it is attested since the early twentieth century but is thought to be much older; cf. Tuscan arare "to plough; to have sex with".

Whether or not the namers of the Minister a Ðar "Ministry for Agriculture" were aware of the slang usage, many caricaturists have since seized on the pun.

L'a un sgart mallovicher de ðar.
/la ɪn sgart ˌma.lo.vɪˈkɛr de ðar/

116.3: veðrvent "vane"

veðrvent /ˌvɛ.ðr̩ˈvɛnt/ [ˌvɛ.ðɐˈvɛnt]
- vane, weathervane, weathercock, a  mechanical device rotating around one axis and attached to an elevated object such as a roof for showing the direction of the wind;
- anemometer, windmeter, a more sophisticated device for measuring and recording the speed and direction of the wind;
- (metaphorically) volte-face, about-face, U-turn, flip-flop, a sudden reversal of opinion or strategy

Etymology: folk-etymological alteration of Old Borlish veðrevit "vane" under the influence of vent "wind" < synonymous ventus in Latin. The Old Borlish is a borrowing from Old Norse veðrviti "vane", literally "weather knower". Synchronically interpretable as "wind-glass"; though they are not normally made of glass, the word has been analysed as referring to glassware used for measurement. In metaphorical usage the word is seen from the eighteenth century.

Y torvegl indugs ec mesuranç suprem de veðrvent tras istr.

##

116.4: clou "segment"

clou /klu/ [klu]
- clove, segment, one of the parts (as of a fruit or bulb) into which any body naturally separates or is divided;
- sector, piece, slice, part of a circle bounded by two radii and an arc they subtend (also of any circular object);
- faction, party, bloc, a political organisation of voters and/or politicians who share common goals

Etymology: from Old Borlish clou /klu(v)/ "clove (of garlic)", borrowed from synonymous clufu in Old English. The meaning was extended to other portions of things in the Middle Borlish period; in the phrase clou politic "political party" it is attested from the seventeenth century.

Il aun cascun dou clou a vastel ja paut.
/ɪl on kaˈxɪn du klu a vaˈstɛl ʒa pot/
[ɪˈlon kɐˈçɪn du klu a vɐˈstɛl ʝa pot]

116.5: Kernovan Conjuring

The Kernovan Conjuring (Borlish Conjuraçon Cornovan /ˌkɔɲ.ʒɪˈrants ˌkɔr.noˈvan/) was a collaboration between the Kingdom of Greater Devon and Roger Drengot, Duke of Normandy to press the Duke's claim to the throne of Kent. This plot is considered the proximate cause for the creation of the First Drengot Empire across Gaul [France] and southern Albion [Great Britain].

The Conjuring was carried out in 1029, following the death of King Rodulf of Kent. Kent under the long-reigning Rodulf had prospered, with recognised supremacy over the rump Wessex (albeit not uncontested by Devon) and over Essex to the north. After eight decades of political manoeuvring, Rodulf lingered on his deathbed and the succession was deeply uncertain.

Although no references to a written treaty have survived, it is presumed that the House of Kernow aided Normandy in their bid for the Kentish throne in exchange for support in becoming the new ruling dynasty of Greater Devon. This bargain was upheld, but it only took a couple of decades for Greater Devon to become a vassal of the First Drengot Empire.

In what was either impressive long-term strategy or merely opportunism, the victorious Roger of Normandy would go on to conquer Kent's neighbours, including Essex and Markland, and then venture south to annex much of the rest of Gaul. He was crowned Emperor Roger I in the midst of this territorial expansion in 1038.

The recently-unified Wales under Cadwallan (erstwhile King of Wynneth) managed to remain mostly free of Drengot control. This was likely achieved by steering a course between Greater Devon and the Drengot, neither of whom wanted to other to have dominion over Wales.

117.2: mallovicher "naïve"

mallovicher /ˌma.lo.viˈkɛr/ [ˌma.lʊ.vɪˈkɛː]
- naïve, rose-tinted, ingenuous, overly optimistic or blind to obvious pitfalls and downsides;
- chipper, bubbly, pert, peppy, cheerful in an annoying way

Etymology: 19C, adjectival derivation from mallovic "someone who is naïve and cheerful to a ridiculous or irritating extent". This is a borrowing from synonymous Merch mallowick or directly from the character Mall-Lowick /ˈmal ˈlu.ɪk/ and her eponymous novel, in which she is a young girl subjected to various travails but never losing her hopeful demeanour. Her name is a compound of Mall, a hypocoristic form of Mary, and Lowick, which comes via Old French Loïc from Frankish Hloðwig (cf. Vascon Luixa and Napolitan Ludgia [and IRL Louise]). The name was applied almost immediately in a mocking way to a person seen as similar to Mall-Lowick.

J'osc sy cigl novel; i's mallovicher sad demay.
/ʒox si tsajl noˈvɛl | ɪz ˌma.lo.vɪˈkɛr sad deˈme/

117.3: grabattour "paramedic"

grabattour /ˌgra.baˈtur/ [ˌgʀa.bɐˈtʊː]
- paramedic, EMT, a person trained to medically stabilise injured people on-site before they can be transported to a hospital;
- (historical, esp. Millstone War) stretcher-bearer, a soldier or auxiliary serviceman who carries the wounded away from the battlefield on stretchers

Etymology: 20C, agentive derivation from grabat "stretcher, gurney; emergency medical transport". This is a borrowing via another Romance language from Latin grabātus "cot, pallet, camp bed", from Greek. Transfer from the military context to peacetime healthcare is attested from the 1950s.

J'addoceu my sour d'ig j'er grabattour parsiscent.

117.5: Sound Changes from Vulgar Latin to Borlish

The dialects of Borlish are the only surviving descendants of the Insular variety of Vulgar Latin, which comprised Borlish Latin and British Latin. This variety was not overly divergent from the contemporary (ca. 3rd to 5th century) Latin of the continent, with the following exceptions:

    The loss of intervocalic  /w/, as evidenced in inscriptions by e.g. clam "key" (continental clavem) and denio "I reach" (continental devenio).
    The loss of wordfinal  /s/, probably preceded by a period of debuccalisation where final  was pronounced /h/. The dating of this sound change is controversial; cf. fifth-century *a femna* "the women (acc.)" (Classical hās fēminās "these women").

The second of these local changes was grammatically significant, as it weakened the distinctions between forms in noun declensions. Indeed, already by the Old Borlish period all number and case distinctions in nouns have been lost.

    Posttonic vowel loss
    V > ∅ / "VC_CV
    Final syllable simplification
    m > n / _# if stressed
    m s > ∅ / _# otherwise

e.g. amictate /ˌa.mikˈta.te/ "friendship" < amīcitātem

    Palatalisation part 1
    [t k]j [d g]j > tʃ dʒ
    k g > tʃ dʒ / _[i e]
    k > j / _C except [r l w j]
    Fortition
    w > β /#_
    j > dʒ / #_, V_V

e.g. iazo /ˈdʒat.tʃo/ "I lie down" < iaceō

    Consonant lenition part 1
    p t k b d g s > b d g β ð ɣ z / V_[V m l r n j w]
    Palatalisation part 2
    nj lj > ɲ ʎ
    Cj > Cʲ > jC except w or word initially
    Final vowels reduce to schwa (unless stressed)
    V > ə / _# unless stressed

e.g. sabe /ˈsa.bə/ "he knows" < sapit; saibe /ˈsaj.bə/ "I know" < sapiō

    Weak consonants lost
    [β ð ɣ] > ∅ / V_V
    Mid-vowels break in stressed open syllables
    ɛ e ɔ o > je e o ow / stressed open
    ɛ ɔ > e o / elsewhere
    Lenition part 2
    p t k b d g > b d g β ð ɣ / V_V
    C: > C
    Loss of much final schwa
    ə > ∅ / except after consonant clusters

e.g. liei /ljedʒ/ "halt" < Insular laedicum "collision"

    Affricate shift
    tʃ dʒ > ts ʒ
    sk palatalises (fills gap with ʒ), β shift
    sk β > ʃ v
    Vowel u is fronted
    u > y
    Mid-vowel rhotic shift
    e > a / _rC
    e > i / _r#
    Full loss of schwa
    ə > ∅
    Epenthesis before r
    ∅ > d / [n ɲ]_r
    ∅ > b / m_r

e.g. cendre /ˈtsen.dr̩/ "ash" < cinerem; puðir /pyˈðir/ "rot" < pūtēre

    Vowels become lax in closed syllables
    i e o y > ɪ ɛ ɔ ʏ / closed syllables
    Final consonants devoice
    b d g v z ð ʒ > p t k f s θ ʃ / _#
    l-vocalisation and y-diphthong shift
    [l y] > w / _[C #]
    Front vowels merge in weak position
    [ɛ ɪ ʏ ɛj] > ɪ / #_sC
    [ɛ ɪ ʏ] > ɛ / _w[C #]
    Diphthong shift part 1
    ai ɛi ɪi > e i əj
    aw ɛw ɔw > o əw u
    Palatals and ɣ are lost (regenerating some diphthongs)
    ɲ ʎ > n l / #_
    ɲ ʎ ɣ > jn jl j

e.g. aut /ot/ "had" < awt < ayt < ayd < aud < aˈβu.də < aˈbu.tə < aˈbu.to < Vulgar *habūtus;
ismargre /ɪsˈmar.gr̩/ "arise" < ɛjsˈmar.grə < ejsˈmer.grə < ɛksˈmɛr.gre < Vulgar *exmergere

This is the stage, around the turn of the thirteenth century, usually referred to as late Old Borlish:

    …sovravnt il deft nostre saȝntaðesem eð atavalesem n iȝ atrevre golfhavn seȝ hamar dont y verb divin ismetre ac povre paian. peðev soul ez font istovent por vn nov cliȝs d istroienz istablir…
    /soˈvront ɪl dɛwt ˈnostr̩ ˌsajn.taˈðɛsɛm ɛð aˌta.vaˈlɛsɛm nəj aˈtrəwr̩ gɔlfˈhon sej haˈmar dɔnt i vɛrb diˈvɪn ɪsˈme.tr̩ ak ˈpovr̩ paˈʒan ‖ peˈðəw sul ets fɔnt ɪs.toˈvɛnt pɔr yn nu cləjs dɪsˈtrɔjənts is.taˈblɪr/
    …uphold our most sacred and ancient duty to let Gulfhaven be the centre from which we will send the Word of God to pagan lands. We ask only for the necessary funds for a new teachinghouse…

Moving into the Middle Borlish period:

    Rhotacisation of syllabic l
    l > r / C_# except [j w]_#

This gives Borlish its signature pairs like capabr "competent"; capablessem "more competent".

    Aphæresis of initial isC
    ɪ > ∅ / #_sC

Like IRL Italian, this means that many words gain an initial vowel only to lose it a millennium later: Latin stannum "tin" > Old Borlish istan "tin" > Modern Borlish stan "tin". However, this process also deletes initial vowels that were there from the start: Latin historia "story" > Old Borlish istoir "story" > Modern Borlish stoir "story".

    Break-up of sr clusters and hiatus
    ∅ > t / s_r
    ∅ > v / [ɔ o u]_V
    uv > ov

The second of these rules is particularly interesting, since it regenerates some <v> which had been lost in the time of Insular Latin. For example, Latin novellus "new" had Insular form noellus "new" > Old Borlish noel "new" > Modern Borlish novel "new"

    Front rounded vowels are lost
    y ʏ > i ɪ

This provides Borlish with another of its signature features, namely <u> /i ɪ/: tu /ti/ "you (sg)"; prun /prɪn/ "plum". The loss of front rounded vowels led to some homophonous pairs like lun lin /lɪn/ "moon; flax". In many cases this led to one of the pair falling out of use (in this case the latter was replaced with the competing form linsc).

    Voicing of final s
    s > z / _#

The precise timing of this sound change is hard to determine, since it does not interact with any nearby sound changes. Likely this originated as a sandhi effect before a following vowel-initial word, e.g. tu es un /ti ɛ‿zɪn/ "you are a...", before being extended to all contexts.

    Diphthong shift part 2
    aj ej ij > ɛj i aj
    əj əw > aj aw

Borlish's answer to the IRL Great Vowel Shift, these changes are somewhat more modest (and take place a little later, between 1600 and 1800). In combination with the loss of front rounded vowels, however, these changes determine much of Borlish's least intuitive orthographic behaviour. For example, we have muy /maj/ "crumb", where <uy> underwent the changes /yj > ij  > aj/.

The previous shift reflects the outcomes in the Damvath Standard dialect of Borlish; these recent changes differ greatly in applicability across the island. We clos with an 1800s sound shift:

    Late consonant backing
    ʃ r > x ʀ

The latter of these appears to be part of a general areal phenomenon of backing rhotics. A single word reflecting both these changes is scuir /xajʀ/ "boy".

After time as a secondary city in Albion, London became the imperial capital of the region once more during the Second Tetrarchy as part of the First Drengot Empire.

The Democratic Wars of the mid-eighteenth century saw London finally gain lasting independence from its neighbours in 1748 under Queen Margaret, who could trace her ancestry to the royal families of both Markland and Kent. The office of Lord Mayor remained politically powerful enough to rival that of the new monarch, however.

118.2: rostr "prow"

rostr /ˈrɔ.str̩/ [ˈʀɔ.stɐ]
- prow, bow, the front part of a ship or boat;
- vanguard, the leading members of a convoy of travellers or the leading part of a vehicle (especially of a train);
- (in extended use) forefront, leader, the front part of anything and especially in metaphor to denote the earliest adopters of a technology or custom;
- nib, the point of a pen or similar tool;
- tip, any pointed extremity

Etymology: an uncomplicated descendant from Latin rōstrum "bill, beak, snout, muzzle; prow". The latter meanings are thought to derive from the anatomical senses of the Latin word. Extension from boats to other vehicles and then into metaphorical usage occured during the Middle Borlish period.

Y rostr a my creðon es coroccað.

##

118.3: balis "beacon"

balis /baˈlɪz/ [bɐˈlɪz]
- beacon, signal fire, a warning light to communicate some message (especially in a military context);
- lighthouse, a tower supporting a light to guide sailors;
- (metaphorically) anything designed to be extremely conspicuous or mark the way;
- aerial, antenna, a device for transmitting electronic signals into the form of radio waves

Etymology: a borrowing via Middle French balise "beacon; buoy" from contemporary Portingale baliza "buoy". This appears to be from an unattested Late Latin pālītia, related to pālus "stake, post". In the sense "lighthouse" it is clipped from the phrase tour balis "beacon tower"; in the last sense it is attested from the early twentieth century.

Nos stoun balis sobottal luicessem.

##

118.4: sounç "release"

sounç /sunts/ [suns]
- release, the act of letting something or someone go or of causing something or something to become unstuck or untangled;
- launch, the movement of a vessel from land or moorage into the water;
- outbreak, outburst, the sudden appearance of something such as illness or war;
- (vulgar) orgasm, climax, the peak of sexual pleasure

Etymology: nominal derivative from verb souvr "solve, let go, release, launch", from solvō "I loosen, untie"; or, directly from a Latin noun solventia "a loosening, an untying". In the last sense attested from as early as the eighteenth century in erotic literature; the term continues to be dispreferred in formal or technical contexts.

118.5: Hasiny

Hasiny is the largest and most populous of the polities of British Mendeva. This refers to the region of Mendeva which have undergone significant settlement from or otherwise been significantly influenced by the Kingdom of Britain.

Hasiny is centred on the lower parts of the watershed of the Bahassassin River, but its lands extend sufficiently far northeast so as to share a short border with New Provence along part of the Sturgovan range. It borders the polity of Taisha to the west, and its capital city is Nadacow, which lies on the Bahassassin.

The name Hasiny derives from the confederation of the same name, which extended across lands which are now part of Hasiny and Taisha.

The languages of administration in Hasiny are Jaughta (Jahtá, the Mendevan language spoken by a majority of the populace) and the local variety of Welsh (which differs in important ways from the dialects of British or Chrysian Welsh).

Hasiny was the homeland of the herdtale genre of fiction, which sought to depict a rural idyll with a focus on animal husbandry.

The resort town of Y Davarn Heul (The Sun Hotel) was constructed in the nineteenth century for Hasiny's ruling Tamaha dynasty, gaining such fame that the word "davarn" has entered many languages with the meaning "grand hotel, resort".

The first radio was built in Hasiny in 1903. The fourth Lineball Global Tourney (LGT) in 1935 took place in Hasiny, the first time it was held in Mendeva.

As imperial hegemony in Europe and northern Africa began to fall apart, so did the Single Caliphate; an independent admiralty in Libya was declared in 1237 (at roughly the same time as the Morrove admiralty to the west).

119.2: sleut "politician"

sleut /slawt/ [zlawt]
- politician, representative, someone engaged in politics as an elected or appointed official;
- smooth talker, sycophant, silver tongue, someone skilled in charming people or especially in keeping the peace

Etymology: substantive use of the past participle of verb sleir "to elect, to vote for", itself via Old Borlish isler "elect" from Vulgar Latin exligō (Classical ēligō "I pick, choose, elect"). The term was used almost immediately as a somewhat derogatory term for anyone perceived to act in the manner of a politician.

Noc imprefait es ig tell'heir denoy sleut.
/nɔk ˌɪm.preˈfet ɛz aj tɛˈlir deˈnɔj slawt/

119.3: a squid "on the take"

a squid /a skwɪd/ [a skwɪd]
- on the take, corrupt, bought, bribed, accepting money from illicit sources in exchange for their influence;
- subverted, in the pocket (of), secretly under someone else's control

Etymology: 19C, analysable as a phrase meaning "at handshake", using the slang term squid "handshake; informal agreement, under-the-table deal". However, it is unclear whether the noun squid is a backformation, as the phrase may have been borrowed wholesale from contemporary Welsh á sguyd "with a (hand)shake", a derivative of verb squid "shake, toss, tremble".

J'aye spien ig l'oç madarc no fos a squid.
/ʒɛˈje spjɛn aj lɔts maˈdark no fɔz a skwɪd/

##

119.4: rubic "sporty"

rubic /riˈbɪk/ [ʀɪˈbɪk]
- pertaining to sports;
- sporty, athletic, inclined to physical activity;
- competitive, cutthroat, eager to win against others

Etymology: a 19C backformation (based on analogy to the adjectival -ic ending) from rubicon "sports, athletic activity". This itself is an 18C folk-etymological form (evoking the idiom y Rubicon trasir "to pass the point of no return; to start a fight"), possibly via a French or English language, from Willem Dutch robicong "competition, sport, athletics". This is a compound of rob "fight, contest, brawl" and iken "to be compared, compete".

Le scey tojorn quondant con un çod rubic.

120.2: ne fousc "broke"

ne fousc /ne fux/ [nɪˈfux]
- broke, penniless, destitute, having no money;
- bankrupt, ruined, in a position of not having enough money to pay one's debts

Etymology: nineteenth-century idiom literally meaning "in (a) pit". The noun fousc "pit, hole in the ground; trap, snare, pitfall" descends with meaning pracatically unchanged via Old Borlish fouz /futʃ/ from fovea in Latin. The coventionalised intensifier for this idiom is arð "steep", which has been analogised to other expressions for poverty; cf. povr arð "very poor".

Jo luy dau un cromn neðan i surcous ne fousc arð.
/ʒo laj do ɪn krun neˈðan i sɪrˈkuz ne fux arθ/

##

120.3: inoïð "silent"

inoïð /ˌɪ.nɔjˈɪθ/ [ˌɪ.nʊˈjɪh]
- silent, soundless, noiseless, without any sound;
- unheard, unnoticed, ignored, forgotten, unrecognised, not acknowledged;
- unheard-of, unprecedented, never before having been done or otherwise experienced

Etymology: negated past participle of oïr "to hear", seen in usage extended from the literal "unheard" from the twelfth century. The verb descends directly from Latin audiō "I hear". In the specific sense "unprecedented" it is seen from the seventeenth century.

Com soð vos tout dijarnt a mesur dell'ec asc inoïð?
/kɔm sɔθ vɔz tut diˈʒa.rn̩t a meˈzɪr dɛˈlɛk ax ˌɪ.nɔjˈɪθ/

##

120.4: frastr "ash"

frastr /ˈfra.str̩/ [ˈfra.stɐ]
- ash tree, a deciduous tree in the olive family;
- ashwood, the wood of the ash tree;
- (historical) javelin, a light spear thrown as a lang-distance weapon;
- tough, resilient, sturdy, able to withstand considerable force;
- (slang) jacked, built, shredded, strapping, burly, notably muscular

Etymology: direct descendant via Old Borlish fra(i)sre "ash tree, ash wood, spear" from synonymous frāxinus in Latin. Ash wood has been used for spear shafts since pre-Classical times. As an adjective the word is seen from the fourteenth century; in its specific slang sense it is likely at most fifty years old.

Con ðigl eu nos y dou port rent frasterrem.

120.5: Borland before Borlish

excerpt from Borland before Borlish (Istr Boral pre Borallesc), a history textbook published in 1983 though the New Vithor University.

…discussion of the Kelt peoples who lived on Borland before the Roman conquests of the Flavian period is limited by our lack of written sources. The few inscriptions we do have are mostly translations of placenames and the names of tribes in Roman sources, appearing since the onset of diplomacy and trade with Rome since Julius Caesar's expeditions to Britannia in the first century aN.

One important exception is the name the Borland Kelts appear to have used collectively to distinguish themselves from the Britons: the Bora Ale. There has been speculation for centuries that the name Borrhaloi (which the Greek explorer Pytheas gives alongside Bretannike, and which became Latin Borālēs) is of Kelt origin, and not merely a derivative of Greek Βορρᾶς "the North Wind, the North". The 1932 unearthing at the Livaucr site of a burial marker reading IANTUMOR ABONDUU ALE "Jantumarus of the Abonduvii" proved that ales (pl. alē, cognate with Welsh ail "second", Latin alius "other") was used locally to mean "people, tribe".

Hence, Bora Ale is reconstructed as meaning "people of the East", with bora(g) "East, sunrise" corresponding to Welsh bore "morning" and Irish márah "tomorrow". It may even have originated as a exonym applied by the Britons, which would explain the hypothesised sense development of a word which originally meant "others".

Of course, the Borland Kelts did not always conceive of themselves as an indivisible group, and over a dozen tribal names are attested…

121.2: baðaspat "nonplussed"

baðaspat /ˌba.ðaˈspat/ [ˌbaðɐˈspat]
- nonplussed, bewildered, perplexed, puzzled, thrown, at a loss, in a state of confusion;
- indignant, outraged, startled, astonished, in a state of heightened emotion and reflexive disapproval

Etymology: first mentioned in the eighteenth century as a new piece of fashionable slang, probably of dialectal origin. Thought to be a compound; the first part is a form of baðar, local variant of sbayar "gawp, goggle" descending from Medieval Latin (ex)batō, exbadō "I gape, yawn". The second part spat is presumably a variant of spait, past participle of spagir "frightened, scared" and descending from Vulgar Latin expaveō "I am terrified of".

L'aye min baðaspat de my vestið vabian closnautr.
/lɛˈje mɪn ˌba.ðaˈspat de mi vɛˈstɪθ vaˈbjan klɔˈsnotr̩/

121.3: scaug "hung"

scaug /xoj/ [xoj]
- thicket, copse, grove, stand, a dense but small collection of trees or shrubs;
- bramble, briars, an area of thorny shrubs
- tangle, mess, snarl, a knotted twisted mass;
- maze, conflict, dispute, an intricate complication or difficult situation;
- tangled, knotty, snarled, interwoven as of strands or branches;
- thorny, complex, intricate, hard to navigate or make progress through;
- unresolved, unsolved, indeterminate, open, unsettled, not having been sorted out;
- (law) hung, undecided, of a jury not having reached a verdict;
- (politics) hung, of a legislature lacking a majority political party

Etymology: a borrowing from early Middle English shawe, scaȝe "thicket", from synonymous sceaga in Old English. Extended metaphorically to any tangle by the fifteenth century, and in adjectival use since the seventeenth. In its legal and political senses it is attested from the Global Workshop period.

121.4: desbiacq "hung"

desbiacq /dɛˈsbjak/ [dɪˈzbjak]
- imbalanced, lopsided, skewed, leaning to one side or having inequal quantities in different parts;
- aslant, askew, diagonally, obliquely, turned or twisted to one side;
- (music) swung, with beats split into a pair of notes the first of which is somewhat longer than the second;
- (slang, crude) hung, well-endowed, having a notably large penis

Etymology: early modern borrowing via French desbiaque "slanted, lopsided" from synonymous di sbiaco in an Italian language. The noun sbiaco "slant, bias tape" comprises the prefix s- and a descendant from Vulgar Latin oblaecus, variant of oblīquus "sidelong, awry; hostile". Used in a musical context since the nineteenth century; in the last sense (lately often clipped to biacq) it is seen from approximately the same time.

Y baðrment trassonnau an bercellot desbiacq.

121.5: Pluralisation

Final /-s/ is lost really early on in the development of Borlish; it's one of the very first sound changes that distinguishes it from the mainland Romance languages, occuring by around 500 AD. This, along with the loss of the genitive case (replaced with the ablative) makes the noun declension of typical nouns look like this:
Image

Notice that masculine nouns typically have only two forms, and feminine nouns only three. Once final vowels also get neutralised to schwa (and eventually lost entirely), the noun paradigm for regular nouns has completely collapsed.

A few nouns briefly retain an irregular paradigm of the following shape, with a separate nominative singular:
Image

However, by the late Old Borlish period these have all been levelled to (usually) the oblique form; sour "sister" is the only counterexample where instead the nominative singular survives.

Several strategies for marking noun number were innovated during the Old Borlish period, mostly involving demonstratives like ille, iste and ipse. However, the forms that survive to the present derive from the demonstrative hic "this". Specifically, we have:

    oc "singular" < hoc, neuter singular
    ec "plural" < haec, neuter plural

In the late Old Borlish period we see the redevelopment of a proximate-distal contrast, with new distal demonstratives formed using the adverb i "there" (since lost; cf. Modern Borlish la < illāc):

    oç < oc i "that" < hoc ibi
    eç < ec i "those" < haec ibi

Coda: Some Modern Borlish Names

There are a few Celtic names which survive in modern Borlish, for various reasons.

A very few names entered Borland Latin from the local Celtic during the Roman Empire. As a possible example, the male name Ivocq is thought to reflect Borland Celtic *iwok- "like a yew tree".

More Celtic names enter Borlish at various stages since the medieval period. One of the earliest is the female name Jonnovar, cognate with Guinevere and Jennifer, and which is also used as a common noun meaning "butterfly".

122.2: lastumnesc "haggard"

lastumnesc /ˌla.stɪmˈnɛx/ [ˌla.stɪmˈnɛç]
- haggard, drawn, stressed, appearing unwell or worried;
- weary, exhausted, tired, suffering from a lack of sleep;
- dilapidated, ramshackle, bedraggled, in poor condition

Etymology: fifteenth century, adjectival derivation from noun lastumn "exhaustion, weariness, stress". This is either a secondary derivation in the Old Borlish period from adjective las "tired, faint, spent" from synonymous lassus in Latin, or else a direct descendant of the Latin noun lassitūdō "faintness, weariness". In its use for things other than people the word is attested from the eighteenth century.

Il ayen heu lastumnesc, com ig il n'ayen for pog dormið.
/ɪl ɛˈjɛn haw ˌla.stɪmˈnɛx | kɔm aj ɪl nɛˈjɛn fɔr pɔj dɔrˈmɪθ/

122.3: çoir "gym"

çoir /tsɔjr/ [ˈtsɔ.jɐ]
- gym, gymnasium, a sports facility specialised for solo physical exercise

Etymology: early twentieth century, clipping of earlier forçoir "gymnasium, fitness suite". This is a derivative of forç "strength, power" < Medieval Latin fortia "force, violence" with the suffix -oir denoting location (or occasionally tools) < synonymous -tōrium in Latin.

Surcay nos condoceu an çoir parey.
/sɪrˈke nɔz ˌkɔn.doˈtsaw an tsojr paˈri/

122.4: pounçar "flirt"

pounçar /punˈtsar/ [pʊnˈtsɐː]
- abrade, exfoliate, to use pumice stone to smooth or clean;
- (archaic) snog, neck, kiss, make out, to kiss passionately;
- charm, coax, flatter, to use one's words and manner to persuade or seduce someone;
- flirt, woo, to play at courtship or seduction

Etymology: originally in the first sense, a verbal derivation from pounç "pumice stone", itself via Norman from synonymous pūmex in Latin. In its archaic sense its usage mirrors others slang terms relating rubbing motions to sexual activity. By the mid-nineteenth century the term had weakened to describe flirtatious behaviour.

Fig a pounçar e faç mey garaf poll'oc gat!

122.5: Vascon Ascendancy

    collected notes on the period of Western European history known as the Vascony Ascendancy.

The Vascon Ascendancy (Vascon: L'Ascendença Vasconna; Vask: Igualdea Vascoina) refers to the polity of Vascony from the early fifteenth century until the late sixteenth. At this time it enjoyed a territorial maximum due to several successful military conquests, as well as a general increase in prosperity.
Image

(Vascony, 1456 N)

The beginning of the Ascendancy is usually placed at the start of the reign of Ambrose II, who was crowned in 1410. His reign was marked by a succession of wars, both west into northern Portingale (taking all of Galice and even down to Braga), and east into Burgundy (taking the wealthy coastal regions of Tolose and Provence).

Ambrose III "the Ascendant" (for whom the period was retrospectively named) succeeded his grandfather in 1456. He established the New Navarre Enterprise two years later, an expanded merchant fleet with the dual aims of monopolising the trade of North Atlantic fish through the Middlesea and of creating trade ports down the western coast of Africa. This led to greatly increased fishing activity, and it was Vask ships travelling north past Valland [Greenland] that encountered Brasil [Newfoundland] in the 1471 Novomundine Landfall.

Trade with the Novomund, especially once the far more favourable southern route was discovered, enriched Vascony and especially the port towns in Portingale and Leon. Cities flourished, and there was also an outpouring of new artistic techniques from painting to poetry.

The Ascendancy is by most accounts over by the War of the Two Queens in the second half of the sixteenth century. By this time the land of both Portingale and Provence had been lost and the polity was reduced to its heartland. Furthermore, the Second Great Dying killed almost one in seven people in Vascony (although immigration was high enough to offset the loss of population by 1550).

123.2: arveiðrous "random"

arveiðrous /ˌar.viðˈruz/ [ˌɐː.vɪ(ð)ˈʀuz]
- arbitrary, discretionary, unspecific, subjective, not based on any objective criterion;
- random, unpredictable, not conforming to any perceptible pattern;
- impulsive, capricious, spontaneous, acting without reason or forewarning

Etymology: seventeenth century, adjectival derivative from arveiðr "impulse, whim, caprice". This descends directly from Latin arbitrium "judgement, decision; discretion". In the sense of unpredictability the word is attested from the late eighteenth century.

Jo fey paupieðr an spaiðoir arveiðrous con hast.
/ʒo fi poˈpjɛðr̩ an speˈðɔjr ˌar.viðˈruz kɔn hast/

123.3: ðorof "drove"

ðorof /ðoˈrɔf/ [ðʊˈʀɔf]
- drove, a group of animals being driven as to market or between fields;
- (by extension) any group of people or animals on the move being led by someone;
- herd, flock, a group of certain animals such as rabbits and hares

Etymology: from Old Borlish ðor(o)f "assembly, herd", a borrowing influenced both by Old English þorp, þrop "village, assembly" and by drāf "the action of driving; herd, company; road". Compare the word garaf "grip" from Old Portingale grafo, garfo "hook" for the result of Vr, rV metathesis.

cofrsac /ˌkɔfr̩ˈsak/ [ˌkɔ.fɐˈsak]
- backpack, rucksack, a case of leather or fabric for carrying things on the back;
- shoulder bag, messenger bag, a sack worn on one shoulder and around the chest

Etymology: Middle Borlish, compound of cofr "basket" (now archaic or dialect) < synonymous cophinus in Latin, and sac < Latin saccus "bag, sack". Originally in the latter senses, denoting a bag carried like a basket; in the "backpack" sense it is attested only from the late nineteenth century.

123.5: Dart Geometry

excerpted from Drawing in the Sand: the History of Calculation, a collaborative reference book originally published 1954 in Napolitan as Scheme ne Rene: a Storia d'Amiradanza by the Agenza Scholaria Fodgesa.

…tempting to draw a straight line from Euclid's Elements until the introduction of new instantiations of geometry in Ferenc's pioneering 1819 work Geometriæ Inquadrabiles, seeing any developments in the meantime as merely the proving of ever more particular theorems. However, this fails to acknowledge the truly conceptual advancements in the field, which would go on to influence diverse parts of mathematics and theory.

In this section, we chart the development of the "dart method" as an extension of Euclidean geometry. In all the theorems of The Elements, no distinction is made between a line AB and its reverse BA. It is only in the late fifteenth century that scholars like Barclythe and da Treviso begin to assign directions to lines (it is unclear whether the parallel developments at the Hicma Academy in Baghdad are due to direct communication or simply an independent invention).

It was this seemingly trivial addition that enabled geometers to do two important things. First, it brought ablate [negative] quantities into the realm of respectability in European mathematics; although the idea of "less-than-no things" was absurd (nonetheless, ablate numbers were already being used in the account-books of Venise and other trade cities to denote debts), no-one was perturbed by the concept of returning to one's starting point by trdavelling from A to B, and then from B to A. Second, it allowed for stronger ties between geometry and the newly-imported algebra; adding together two directed lines was conceptually as easy as laying two arrows point-to-vane.

In this way, one could translate a geometric statement like "the lines a, b and c form a triangle" into the algebraic equation "a + b = c". Indeed, over the proceeding decades mathematicians worked to render all the proofs of the Elements into this form. Extending the theory to mozate [two-dimensional] shapes took…

124.2: entr hugt e gavisc "torn"

entr hugt e gavisc /ˈɛntr̩ hajt e gaˈvɪx/ [ˈɛn.tɐ hajt e gɐˈvɪç]
- torn, unable to decide between two (good) options;
- living it up, going from strength to strength, experiencing a continual abundance of good fortune

Etymology: idiom from the fifteenth century (Kigman), literally "between happiness and joy". The noun hugt "happiness" descends from Old Borlish huȝt, a borrowing from Old English hyht "hope"; the noun gavisc is a deverbal from gavir "enjoy, feel happy", which descends directly from Latin gaudeō "I rejoice, make merry". Used primarily with negative valence (portraying the necessary choice as an imposition) until the nineteenth century, at which the latter sense begin to be attested.

L'indrec de my sour es se trovant entr hugt e gavisc.

124.3: fis "done"

fis /fɪz/ [fɪz]
- set, stuck, immovable, placed somewhere on a more-or-less permanent basis;
- done, complete, finished, having nothing else of an activity or project to do;
- spent, exhausted, empty, having been entirely used up;
- despairing, hopeless, resigned to the inevitability of failure or defeat;
- screwed, finished, in a hopeless situation

Etymology: past participle of figr "set down, place down, lay" used also as the past participle of figr a "finish, finish off, complete, stop" (where perhaps fis la would be more regular). In the sense of having run out of something, the word is seen from the sixteenth century; in the last senses it is seen from the seventeenth.

Nossy foyail es fis e scein lau pre yonoscon.

dignant /dajˈnant/ [dɐjˈnant]

- named, called, known as, AKA, alias, having been given an appellation

Etymology: present participle of dignar "merit, deserve, be worthy of", itself a verbal derivation from Old Borlish diȝn "worth, merit". This reflects Latin adjective dignus "worthy, appropriate, meet". The latter senses are seen from the late Middle Borlish period.

Tal inquit no son dignant de mell'yam.

124.5: Who's Who (1700s Edition)

    collected notes on various figures active during the eighteenth century.

Raymond al Mustafa (fl. 1750) was a mathematician and philosopher. He was resident for some time in Barcelon under the Duke of Aragon's patronage. During this time he corresponded with fellow theorist Rachel Desselut, and their letters outline some of the concepts that would go on to define the field of methodics.

He spent his latter years travelling, eventually settling in Brasil [Newfoundland]. His grandson Fabian Mostàf became an eminent astronomer at the Paratzon Observatory, using mathematical techniques developed in part by Raymond (like the waveform display [Fourier transform] to compute celestial orbits).

-

Marian Siegert ~ Miller (1725–56) was the illegitimate daughter of Elias Villingen, second Duke of Far Suebia [~a region west of Swabia]. She grew up at the ducal seat in Castle Carlsfeld as a recognised bastard, and was close with the Duke's younger legitimate children. She married Albert Siegert, a merchant in leather and a magnate of the shoemaking industry, at the age of eighteen, and moved with him to Lepzi [Leipzig].

From her regular correpondence with her half-brother Thomas she is known to have learnt to speak Burgund as a child and Bohamish [Czech] as an adult. With Albert she had several children, the eldest of whom would become the pioneering author Elsebeth Sneider.

-

Lord Mathurin Carrow, Baron of Ebbasham [Epsom] (fl. 1763) was a traveller who published accounts of his journeys. He is remembered in particular for his mealbooks which compile recipes from the places he visited.

An early work of his, A Complete Assembly of the Towns and Cities of Markland for the Edification of the Good Food Amateur, was popular across the Northwestern Isles [Britain, Ireland and Borland] (the Borlish translation being infamously inaccurate) but failed to sell further afield. Later volumes like An Account of the Vittles of the Various German Peoples and On the Sundry Uses of the Shadome Fruit [tomato] were far more enduring, being republished several times even after his death.

- tedium, ennui, boredom, a general sense of listlessness and lacking of engaging activity

Etymology: idiom meaning "donkey's work", attested from the eighteenth century. The noun laur "work, job" is a deverbal from laurar "to work"; the noun asn "donkey; dunce" descends directly from synonymous asinus in Latin.

Etymology: phrase meaning "punch from (the) flank", used figuratively to describe an unexpected event since the late eighteenth century. The noun ðorn "punch" is a deverbal from now-obsolete aðornar "to punch", itself directly from synonymous addurnō in Insular Latin (of ultimate Kelt origin). The noun hanc "hip, hipbone; flank, loin, side" descends from Vulgar Latin hanca "hip", from a German source related to ankle in English.

Y victoir dell'ig sleut sta un ðorn de hanc.
/i vɪkˈtɔjr dɛˈlaj slawt sta ɪn ðɔrn de hank/
[i vɪkˈtɔ.jɐ dɪˈlaj zlawt sta ɪn ðɔːn de haŋk]

125.4: govondry "canteen"

govondry /ˌgo.vɔnˈdri/ [ˌgo.vʊnˈdʀi]
- canteen, cafeteria, a small cafe inside a larger establishment (e.g. military base, school, prison or workplace);
- tuck shop, lunch counter, snack bar, a counter selling small items of food

Etymology: Middle Borlish govonry "inn, eatery", place derivation from now-obsolete govon "innkeeper, barkeeper". This appears to descend directly from Latin caupō "tradesman, innkeeper". It specialisation to small eateries and counters within organisations takes place first in a military context during the eighteenth century.

J'acatau dou quignou de nossy govondry.
/ˌʒa.kaˈto du kwajˈnu de nɔˈsi ˌgo.vɔnˈdri/

125.5: Denmark

Denmark is a peninsular polity located between the North and Graven Seas.

History
Denmark was part of the homeland of the Danes during the Dane Supremacy in the medieval period, from which viking raids and colonisation projects left. The rulers of Borland and much of Dane England during this time were dynasties originating in Denmark.

During the sixteenth century Denmark was part of the Dane Concert, a monarchic union of northern states. The royal family undertook a grand tour of their realm in the years around 1560, visiting places like Alburgh. It was this period which saw Revitalism reach Denmark, with renewed interrogation of Classical texts.

Instability in Denmark belying the Long Peace of the late eighteenth century led to an uptick in emigration, both to nearby polities like Borland and also the distant staddomains of Cappatia.

The expansion of suffrage in Denmark took place through the latter half of the nineteenth century, parallel to similar movements in Saxony and the Latin republics. During this time Denmark was drawn into the orbit of the Drengot Collusion, although it was never fully incorporated.

People
Elisa Arnoutszen (fl. 1540), nurse in the household of Duke Roger d'Avosche and later a physician in her own right
Laurz Arnoutszen (fl. 1540), famed physician whose treatise on medical handiwork revolutionised European practice
Absolon Mortenszen (fl. 1560), playwright and commentator who lived in Alburgh and is remembered for his play High Society
Gudmund & Rebecca Scrander (fl. 1677), astronomers who voyaged to Seldiva to observe a transit of Venus

126.1: Secret Notes

excerpt in translation from the 1930 work Notas a Hurt "Secret Notes", an example of the spycraft genre written in Vascony by author Micolau Zorriqueta (whose similar series of works about a Huzatre detective is more widely remembered).

Martin scoutau y baðrment durant hour monfeyað e fo mesteyað n'yembr scið posc i lançau ogl a sell'orlosc a caðen ig for veint minut n'ern laundað.
Martin listened to the ensemble for several hours and was disappointed to discover when he glanced at his watch that only twenty minutes had passed.

Cos ouveg i recuidau ig Jacq n'aye besogn aut de sy presenç la bogr; l'ec fardig a torriot dont Martin aye sy parcorrenç oïð ig crevoscr ayen son nervous e meðes foyaçant.
Sullenly he reflected that James hadn't needed him in attendance at all; the bassoon solos Martin had heard him rehearsing last night sounded confident and even virtuosic.

Manifest tan sta ig lorry caf maldigt au l'orn enter recompos.
It was also apparent that the accursed leader had rearranged the programme.

James's biggest moment would come right at the end of the evening, so Martin couldn't even sneak out to the venue's bar at the interval.

It was an overture from that opera he'd been dragged to a film staging of and subsequently ranted at about for two hours.

There were monsters with five feet in it, he thought—although he really hadn't been paying attention.

126.2: scobr "bang"

scobr /ˈxɔbr̩/ [ˈxɔ.bɐ]
- bang, pop, the sound of an explosion;
- slap, crack, a sudden percussive sound

Etymology: from Old Borlish scoble, scople "explosion", from a Vulgar Latin form scoplus which shows metathesis from scloppo "slap"; compare Tuscan schioppo "gun", Barcelon esclop "woodblock, clog".

Nos s'yettaum por scap fair dell'eç scobr.

126.3: nastr "strap"

nastr /ˈnastr̩/ [ˈna.stɐ]
- strap, thong, a long narrow strip of leather or similar material;
- belt, band, a flat loop of material;
- whip, lash, a strip commonly of leather used to create a noise or to strike

Etymology: via Old Borlish nasle "strap, thong" and an identical Old French word from a Classical German noun derivative of nastiō "bind, tie, braid, plait". Extended to the tool used in animal husbandry and as a weapon in the Middle Borlish period.

Y nastr a my sac son flois demay.
/i ˈnastr̩ a mi sak sɔn flɔjz deˈme/

##

126.4: soccos destr "red-handed"

soccos destr /sɔˈkɔz ˈdɛstr̩/ [sʊˈkɔz ˈdɛ.stɐ]
- made, rumbled, caught, red-handed, having been discovered doing deceitful or illicit behaviour;
- unmasked, exposed, outed, having had some formerly secret information revealed

Etymology: past participle of soccoðr des "to shake out of; to unmask". The verb soccoðr "shake, mix up" descends directly from Latin succutiō "toss up, fling into the air". The adverb destr "out of there" reflects Latin dē "from" and exter "on the outside".

Nos eum enfugr pront la nos fom soccos destr.
/nɔz awm ɛnˈfajr̩ prɔnt la nɔz fɔm sɔˈkɔz ˈdɛstr̩/

126.5: Chemical Etymology

excerpts from the Veriloquace Glossary of Alchemy, a reference quire compiled by Rotcham University Primers.

- moron n. /ˈmɔː.ɾɔn/ [proton] a deficient [positively charged] particle as found in atomic nuxes [nuclei]. 1888 < Kiew [Kyiv] Russian мора · mora (1882) < Ancient Greek μόρον · móron "mulberry, blackberry", in reference to Nike Sarantylack's "mulberry model" of the atom as containing a number of each of two different sorts of particle.

- lucifer adj., n. /ˈləu.sɪ.fə/ [radioactive (substance)] of a substance, spontaneously producing subatomic particles or ionising light; such a substance. 1894 < Vascon lucifer < Latin lūcifer "light-bringing", from lūx "light" and -fer "carrying". Connected only incidentally with proper noun Lucifer "Satan".

- killdark n. /ˈkɪl.daːk/ [uranium] the corporal [element] whose atoms have 92 mora, a lucifer [radioactive] grey metal. 1810 < Welsh kildárc "killdark" (1805) < the Irish shire of Killdara, where the corporal was first isolated. Plausibly respelt after "dark"; the Wessern English form darick /ˈda.ɾək/ "dark" may also have played a role.

- lix n. /lɪks/ [potassium] the corporal whose atoms have 19 mora, a soft grey metal acted on by air and water and thus never found in tesquo [in nature] as a metal. 1797 < Latin lixa "lye", which is the caustic of lix [potassium hydroxide].

- janthine n. /ˈdʒan.θəin/ [iodine] the corporal whose atoms have 53 mora, found as a grey solid, a purple-black liquid and a purple gas. 1791 < Scholastic Latin janthīnus < Ancient Greek ἰάνθῐνος "violet-coloured".

127.1: Medieval Empire

Following the fall of the northern Lombards in Italy, the ruling family fled to the Empire and managed to obtain appreciable clout there.

127.2: y cæros ovrir de "make possible"

y cæros ovrir de /i keˈrɔz ɔˈvrɪr de/ [i kɪˈʀɔz ʊˈvʀɪː de]
- enable, make possible, allow for, permit, to create conditions such that (something) is more feasible or more likely to occur

Etymology: idiom from the nineteenth century, literally "to open the opportune moment of". The verb ovrir descends (under the influence of covrir "cover") via Old Borlish ovrir, avrir from Latin aperiō "I reveal, open". The noun cæros "window of opportunity, opportune moment" is a modern borrowing from Ancient Greek καιρός "period of time, season; opportunity".

Sell'osceyan vil y cæros nos ovrir de lembic gostar.
/sɛˌlɔ.xiˈjan vɪl i keˈrɔz nɔz ɔˈvrɪr de lɛmˈbɪk gɔˈstar/

##

127.3: broncar "flinch"

broncar /brɔnˈkar/ [bʀʊŋˈkɐː]
- flinch, wince, recoil, to reflexively move away from something perceived as unpleasant or a threat;
- stumble, trip, slip, lurch, to make a sudden unsteady movement;
- balk, back out, chicken out, get cold feet, to refuse to act due to (espeecially sudden) fear or uncertainty

Etymology: from Old Borlish broncar "stumble, misstep", cognate with synonymous bronchier in Old French but of unknown further origin. Perhaps connected to Latin broccus "buck-toothed" or truncus "docked, cut off", but neither is particularly semantically tempting. Unhelpful also are the equally unsourceable examples of Lombard bronco "thorny branch" and Barcelon bronc "knot in wood".

Jo vole pogntar apar ma jo broncau.
/ʒo voˈle pɔjnˈtar aˈpar pi ʒo brɔnˈko/

127.4: snuvr fair "sniff"

snuvr fair /ˈsnɪvr̩ fer/ [ˌznɪ.vɐ feː]
- sniff, sniffle, snivel, snort, to make an audible inhalation through the nose (especially when the nose is blocked);
- scoff, turn up one's nose, sneer, to react with contempt or scorn

Etymology: verb phrase from snuvr "sniff, snort", itself a derivation from the verb snuvlar, which had become obsolete by the seventeenth century. This descends from Old Borlish isnuvlar, a borrowing from Old English snyflan "to have a runny nose". In the latter sense the phrase is attested from the eighteenth century.

No stou bogr snuvr fair dell'oç cæros.
/no stu bɔjr̩ snɪvr̩ fer dɛˈlɔts keˈrɔz/

127.5: Deadly Disasters

notes on the subject of various (alt) historical disasters.

The Great Flie Flood was a natural disaster in 1171 Willemy which submerged or swept through large parts of Frisland. Inflowing waters of the Rustig Strait created the island of Texel, and the freshwater Lake Almere (which fed into the Strait along the Flie river) became brackish and eventually fully saline as a maritime gulf.

The then-duke Lovis the Tall, who had been staying in the environs of Amstel for some months, is the most famous (and most historically influential) casualty of the Flood, but estimates have suggested a death toll approaching ten thousand.

The destruction is thought to have spurred the development of Axbane on Borland as an alternative, safer harbour for traders passing through the Rustigh Strait.

---

The First Burning of London was a conflagration in 1290 which lasted for a full week and killed approximately four hundred people. This was the earliest of several such burnings, at least two of which are more accurately described as sackings or conquerings. Unlike (say) the Fourth Burning, it is purely conjectural that this particular fire was deliberately set as part of a plot to steal the Redstone Chair (presumably orchestrated by some Markland or Kentish noble).

---

The Failed Crusade was an undertaking which aimed to recreate the March of Jerusalem. The city and its surrounds had been captured during the First Crusade and the first Marksman of Jerusalem, Savino the Just, had acceded in 1119, but it had fallen less than seventy years later.

This crusade was called in 1210 by Pope Just (a direct descendant of Lord Savino), and it was utterly unsuccessful. The campaign went so badly that the Convoy Australier having their control of Port Simon and Antioch revoked in 1208 is generally regarded as a boon for the Convoy.

The various military catastrophes stoked discontent in Rome and elsewhere, along with the outbreak of the First Great Dying (a plague thought to have been brought to Europe by returning crusaders).

128.2: fardig "solo"

fardig /farˈdaj/ [fɐːˈdaj]

    solo, music played by a single performer;
    chance to shine, big moment, moment in the spotlight, an oppoortunity to be noticed to do demonstrate one's skill;
    moment of truth, critical point, a time when one's skills or resolve are finally tested (especially after a period of complacency or uncertainty)

Etymology: seventeenth century, originally in the musical sense. Borrowed from a continental language, likely Vascon fardig(a) or Portingale fardigo/a "solo, played alone". These come from a derivative of the Arabic root فَرْد · fard "alone, single, solitary". Extension to non-musical contexts is seen from the late nineteenth century.

    Jo save l'oc caum contene un fardig d'aloud.
    /ʒo saˈve lɔk kom ˌkɔn.teˈne ɪn farˈdaj daˈlud/

128.3: lau pre yonoscon "in the middle of nowhere"

lau pre yonoscon /lo pre ˌjo.nɔˈxɔn/ [lo pʀe ˌʝo.nʊˈxɔn]

    in the middle of nowhere, isolated, a long way from anywhere of interest like settlements or amenities;
    stuck, lost, making no progress on a problem

Etymology: early nineteenth century idiom literally meaning "leagues before wherever". The noun lau "league" comes via Old Borlish from Insular Latin lauga "league" (cf. leuga, legua), originally a Gaulish unit. The pronoun yonoscon "wherever, anywhere" is an extension of yon "where" < Latin ubicumque "wherever" by analogy to words like calscon "whichever" < Latin quāliscumque "of whatever quality". In metaphorical use from the early twentieth century.

    Nos feim un baugl lau pre yonoscon.

128.4: increiltað "disbelief"

increiltað /ˌɪn.krilˈtaθ/ [ˌɪŋ.kʀɪlˈtah]
- doubt, disbelief, incredulity, the inability to believe something;
- doubt, suspicion, mistrust, the inability to trust someone

Etymology: Middle Borlish noun derivation of increil "disbelieving, mistrustful", orphaned negative of (by then obsolete) creil "gullible, trusting". This descends from Latin crēdulus, whence also creu "an oath of frustration or (ironically) appreciation, lately particularly in sexual contexts", which is a 20C borrowing from Portingale créu via the meaning "idiot, git, jerk".

Y taflot nos souvolau un nievr d'increiltað atorn.

128.5: Mathematical Etymology

excerpts from the Veriloquace Glossary o'Mathematics, a reference quire compiled by Rotcham University Primers.

zeffer /ˈzɛ.fə/ [zero] the number of things in an empty collection, the quantity one fewer than one. Before 1350 < Scholastic Latin zefer, zefrum (alt. zephirus by false connection to Zephyr) < Arabic صِفْر • ṣifr "empty, void" < in sense from Sanscrit शून्य • śūnyá "empty, void".

ablate /ˈa.blət/ [negative] fewer than zeffer, as of a debtor's money or a distance backward. 1481 < Lombard ablad < Scholastic Latin ablātus "taken away, withdrawn, removed", first used in financial accounts and taken up by mathematicians some decades later.

dart /ˈdaːt/ [~vector] a segment of a line, considered with a choice of which end is the head and which the vane. Around 1470 < Early Merch dart "throwing spear, dart" < Middle French dart, dard < Medieval Latin dardus < Frankish *darōth < Classical German *darōthus "light spear, javelin, dart". Extended to its mathematical sense by the pictorial analogy of drawing arrowheads on line segments.

augrim /ˈəu.gɾɪm/ [~arithmetic] the mathematics of calculation with numbers; computation more generally. Around 1220 < Drengot augrime, algrisme etc < Old French algorisme < Scholastic Latin algorismus "the use of Arabic numbers" < Arabic الخَوَارِزْمِيّ • al-ḵawārizmiyy, a name of the Persian polymath whose mathematical works introduced much of mathematics to Europe.

arrhumb /ˈa.ɾəm/ [cosine] the sending of an angle to the quotient of the height of a rod rotated by that angle from the vertical to the full length of the rod. Early Merch arrum, arrom (the modern spelling is influenced by unrelated rhumb "compass bearing") < Arabic الرمح • ar-rumḥ "spear, shaft". This appears to be a metaphorical extension related to the use ofوتر • watar < Sanscrit ज्या • jyā́ "bowstring" for vater.

129.2: çaveyar "cushion"

çaveyar /ˌtsa.viˈjar/ [ˌtsavˈjɐː]
- cushion, pad, to furnish with cushions or similar soft things;
- cushion, soften, to absorb or deaden the impact or weight of something;
- sugarcoat, sanitise, prettify, to make (something) more palatable or otherwise easier to accept

Etymology: seventeenth-century backformation from noun çaveyal "cushion, pillow", which descends via Old Borlish ça(r)veȝal "pillow" from synonymous cervīcal in Latin (the loss of /r/ is irregular but compare çavel "brain" < cerebellum). In the last sense the verb is especially seen in the phrase y los çaveyar "to sweeten the pill", literally "to cushion the slab".

Dig mey; tu va noc a y los me çaveyar.

129.3: supellex "paraphernalia"

supellex /ˌsi.pɛˈlɛks/ [ˌsi.pɪˈlɛks]
- paraphernia, miscellanea, stuff, assorted items and especially the things that accrue over time in the course of some pastime or occupation;
- apparatus, kit, equipment, tools of the trade, the set of items one needs to do some activity;
- habits, wont, things that one does as a matter of course (often in a negative sense);

Etymology: 17C borrowing from Latin supellēx "furniture, utensils, kit", likely related to legō "I collect, gather". Extension to behaviours is seen from the late nineteenth century.

Jo trouvau nien benoçabr entr y supellex dy collocquour.

129.4: kirt ag madou "catalyst"

kirt ag madou /kɪrt ɛj maˈdu/ [kɪːt ɛj mɐˈdu]
- catalyst, trigger, spark, inciting incident, a thing or event that sets something (especially something of outsized impact) into motion;

Etymology: idiom attested from the 18C, literally "spark to the kindling". The noun kirt "spark" descends from synonymous kirte in Old Borlish, and is probably onomatopoeic in origin. The noun madou "tinder, kindling" is a borrowing from Middle French (a)madou "lure, bait; kindling, touchwood", a deverbal of amadouer "coax, lure; kindle". This verb is thought to descend via Old Norse mata "lure, feed" from Classical German *matōnam "feed".

Cay rix un kirt ag madou por defas machinaçonal.
/ke rɪks ɪn kɪrt ɛj maˈdu pɔr deˈfaz ˌma.kiˈna.tsoˈnal/

129.5: Arcabil

The Arcabil are a collection of islands in the Atlantic, east of Mashick. They comprise hundreds of landmasses, of which Cocain is the largest.

Toponymy
The name "Arcabil" has traditionally been considered to be an uncomplicated use of Arabic أَرْخَبِيل • ('archabīl) "archipelago", borrowed into Scholastic Latin as Arcabilia (and treated as a plural on the basis of its -bilia ending). However, there is little evidence of such a word existing in Arabic in the fifteenth century.

The possibility has been raised of a metathetic and dissimilatory variant of unattested الكريب • (al-carīb) "the Carib", using a local name for a group of peoples of the Arcabil, but the phonetics are tenuous.

History
The Arcabil were first encountered by Vetomundine powers in the late fifteenth century, during the first stage of the New World Company's voyages west under the aegis of Malik Munir al-Hamdawi. By the early sixteenth century Morrack had established several semi-permanent outposts there, which were important ports for the circumnavigation of the Cynthia under Fredun al-Casmi.

The orange liqueur known as "fleuse" is a genericisation of the Fleus d'Arcabil mixer first manufactured in the early nineteenth century on a Borlish-speaking island of the Arcabil.


People
Judeta Barracin (fl. 1919), author of social comedy born in Andalus who spent her formative years in the Arcabil
Loðaç Berxon (fl. 1910), who grew up in the Arcabil and who was an important member of the Outland Arcabil Association after her emigration to Borland

extract in translation from 1952 work Hus Tars (literally "Sheer Haddock", published in translation under the title "The Heedless Shoal"), written by Haubrath author Marc Lambount. It has become a staple of Borlish lessons for those learning the language in the schools of Markland, despite the title's homophony with Merch his tarse "his penis".

Y port dy cahut closisceu ne çottant e Jacq plombettau sur y hamac criscant, las de sy post quiðeyant. 
The cabin door slammed shut and Jake flopped onto the creaky bunk, exhausted from his gruelling shift.

The horrible stench of diesel exhaust permeated his cramped quarters.

He shoved his weathered backpack into the locker, whose rusty hinges made their familiar screech.

Outside, the relentless waves battered the ship's hull, a constant reminder of their isolation at sea.

As he lay there, sweat beading on his brow, Jake thought back with too-late appreciation to the icy months he'd spent on a North Sea fishing trawler.

130.2: carrot "carriage"

carrot /kaˈrɔt/ [kɐˈʀɔt]
- carriage, wagon, a (usually horse-drawn) vehicle designed for transporting people;
- car, carriage, trolley, a single detachable part of a train;
- module, component, a self-contained (often interchangeable) part of a system which interfaces predictable with other parts

Etymology: diminutive of Old Borlish car "wagon", which descends from Latin carrus "cart, wagon; load" (the suffix may have been added to distinguish the word from car "dear, darling", although the root survives as car "car, automobile" nonetheless). Use for trains is seen with their invention in the nineteenth century; metaphorical extension from that sense is seen in the twentieth.

I laundau cant i descene des y carrot.
/i lonˈdo kant i ˌdɛ.xeˈne dɛz i kaˈrɔt/

130.3: bisan "crisp"

bisan /biˈzan/ [bɪˈzan]
- crisp, fresh, (of the air) dry and cold;
- bracing, refreshing, invigorating, giving someone energy or alertness;
- candid, hard-hitting, blunt, frank, truthful without consideration for finer feelings

Etymology: originally in the first sense, a Middle Borlish derivation from now-obsolete bis "cold air; specifically, a north wind". This is borrowed via French bise "north wind", of uncertain origin. Possible connections include Tuscan bigio "grey, cloudy" or Classical German *bibō "I shiver".

Me stove pieç parol bisan dar a my fraðr.
/me stoˈve pjɛts paˈrɔl biˈzan dar a mi fraðr̩/

130.4: effus "extensive"

effus /ɛˈfɪz/ [ɪˈfɪz]
- extensive, wide-ranging, covering a large area;
- far-reaching, comprehensive, big, major, significant, affecting many things

Etymology: 16th-century borrowing from Latin effūsus "poured out, discharged", past participle of effundō "pour out, discharge" (itself borrowed at roughly the same time as effondr "spread out, disperse, scatter"). As a vaguer word simply meaning "significant" it is seen from the late 18th century.

130.5: Angland

Angland (Borlish Anglont /anˈglɔnt/ [ɐŋˈglɔnt]) is a region in Borland in the west of the island. Its largest population centre is the city of Vithor.

History

The petty kingdom of Angland was founded by Angle immigrants in the fifth century, along with Southbar and several more minor settlements. It quickly established itself in opposition to Southbar and to the rump sub-Roman Borlish state in the east. At the turn of the ninth century it saw an influx of immigration from East Anglia after that kingdom was subjugated by Markland.

After a series of temporary alliances between Angland and Borland, the marriage of Roman king Stiglan's son Marc to the only daughter of Alfegh of Angland unified the kingdoms for good. This was shortly followed by the Battle of Fendal (810) which forced Southbar to swear fealty as a subordinate kingdom. Not long thereafter was Angland conquered by the Danes along with the rest of the island.

The Borland varieties of Old English survived longest in Angland, with records suggesting that an English language descending from the original settlers was spoken in rural parts of the region until as late as the seventeenth century.

Places

Çadrosc, an area of moorland in the northwest which features a labyrinth built in Kelt times
Gambrig, a village and nearby monastery noteworthy for its medieval chronicle in a variety of Old English

131.2: liesc bouclant "time loop"

liesc bouclant /ljɛx buˈklant/ [ljɛç bʊˈklant]
- time loop, (in fiction) a period experienced by one or more people repeatedly;
- (by extension) routine, monotonous or repetitive activity such as errands that are done many times with little variation

Etymology: idiom from the late 19th century, literally "looping duration". The noun liesc "term, period, duration" is a Old Borlish deverbal from lejar "stop moving, crash" (the word originally meaning "endpoint"), from Insular Latin laedicō "I hit, collide". The verb bouclar "loop, curl, go in a circle" derives from Old Borlish boucle "loop, bracelet" (modern boucr), via Old French from Latin buccula "chinstrap".

The phrase was first used in the translation of 1882 work Cludor ncar Vantel "A Postman in Wrexham", which features such a time loop.

Com veleð vos farar ða vos cay un liesc bouclant?
/kɔm veˈlɛθ vɔz faˈrar ða vɔz ke ɪn ljɛx buˈklant/

##

131.3: foyaçant "virtuosic"

foyaçant /ˌfɔjɐˈtsant/ [ˌfɔjˈtsant]
- virtuosic, gifted, masterful, demonstrating immense technical skill;
- flamboyant, resplendent, dazzling, theatrical, bold or audacious in the way one does something;
- showy, showing off, peacocking, ostentatious, being prideful in demonstrating one's abilities

Etymology: present participle of foyaçar "glare, shine brightly, dazzle; show off, flaunt". This is itself a derivation from foyaç "glare, intense light; gaudiness, extravagance", an Old Borlish extension of foy "fire" < focus "hearth" with the pejorative suffix -aç < -āceus "shaped like". The noun foyaç "mess, jumble" < fodiō "I dig up" is unrelated but may have had semantic influence.

The word appears in both approving and disapproving contexts from as early as it is attested.

Cay tell'yoc veram un praxitel foyaçant.
/ke tɛlˈjɔk veˈram ɪn ˌprak.siˈtɛl ˌfɔ.jɐˈtsant/

##

131.4: recuidar "reflect"

recuidar /ˌre.kajˈdar/ [ˌʀe.kɐjˈdɐː]
- reflect, consider, ponder, muse, introspect, think to oneself, to actively think about something or about what one knows;
- deduce, realise, infer, construe, to reach a conclusion by reasoning

Etymology: Middle Borlish coinage derived from cuidar "think, suppose, intend". This descends directly from Latin cōgitō "I think, reflect, have in mind". The extension in Borlish to deduction is attested from the 18th century.

Jo recuida jamay noiteyar n'un davarn.
/ʒo ˌre.kajˈda ʒaˈme ˌnɔj.tiˈjar nɪn daˈvarn/

131.5: Jeans

Jeans (Merch /dʒeːnz/; Borlish Jen /ʒɛn/; Jean Zena /ˈze.na/) is an Italian polity and city of the same name. It comprises the northwest Middlesea coastline of Italy bordering Provence as well as the island of Corse. It has a long history as one of the so-called 'Latin Republics'.

Toponymy

The Merch name Jeans was borrowed from Old French Jannes /ˈdʒa.nəs/, deriving originally from Genua in Latin. This is probably simply the classical local word for "knee" (cf. Classical Latin genu), in reference to the shape of the coastline it lies on.

History

Jeans is the oldest of the Latin Republics, having come into existence in the tenth century. Along with Venise, it serves as a counterpoint to the notion that the Second Tetrarchy period in the eleventh and twelfth centuries was solely comprised of great centralised empires. The leader of Jeans, known as the console, was elected from among the merchant nobility.

In 1207 N Jeans invaded the Tyrrhene Isles of Corse and Sardine, wresting them from Roman control. Only the northernmost of the two islands would remain in the Jean orbit more permanently.

Piracy plagued the Middlesea coast for the same reason that maritime trade was so profitable for Jeans. It reached a peak at the turn of the sixteenth century as newfound wealth from the Novomund flooded the region.

People

132.1: Cinderella Retelling

excerpt in translation from the beginning of a short story by Kitty Unpretty.

Marcus lejau cos soutan a plaç meg dy lag. Un domn oc un curtel azur portant sta ja asseyent sur y Banc de Cris.
Marcus stopped abruptly in the middle of the grass. A woman in a blue dress was already sitting on the Crisis Bench.

I reconnosce noc y curtel. Y domn lançau sy gas atras cant l'er asseyent.
He didn’t recognize the dress. She looked up from where she was sitting.

"Pardon," dis y prinç n'y man leyant. "Jo prefaye noc ig alcun hom no fos ac apart." I creye noc un acconnosc por alcun hom nell'oç curtel memorar. Caye un gendr memorabr de curtel.
“Sorry,” he said, holding up his hands. “I didn’t think anyone would be over here.” He didn’t think he remembered an introduction to anyone in that dress. It was a memorable sort of a dress.

"Jo crey vossy maðr encontrar entarn?" osau i digr, dec l'encontrau ec maðr ne ðougl.
“I believe I ran into your mother inside?” he ventured, because he ran into so many mothers.

132.2: big "chariot"

big /baj/ [baj]
- (historical) chariot, a two-wheeled horse-drawn vehicle as used in Bronze and Iron Age warfare;
- bed, flatbed, a platform at the back of a vehicle on which one can sit or load cargo;
- trunk, boot, an enclosed space at the back of a vehicle for storage;
- sidecar, an attachment to a (motor)bike adding space for a passenger or cargo;
- (chess) rook, castle, the chess piece which moves orthogonally

Etymology: direct descendant via Old Borlish biȝ "wagon, haycart" from Latin bīga "chariot" (reflecting a reduced bi-iuga "two-yokes"). Revived in the sixteenth century in its historical sense, by which time it had shifted to "a platform for loading cargo", from which the other vehicular senses stem. Applied to the chess piece since the seventeenth century (formerly we see roc < Arabic رُخّ "rook").

Cargeð y boist ny big ða il voun le quottar.

132.3: run "symbol"

run /rɪn/ [ʀɪn]
- character, letter, the visual representation of a letter of a writing system;
- symbol, glyph, any non-verbal representation which imparts information;
- (historical, specifically) rune, a letter in one of the German writing systems

Etymology: originally in the last sense, descending from Old Borlish run /ryn/ "rune". This was borrowed either from Old Norse rún "secret, rune" or Old English rūn "mystery, rune". In the Middle Borlish period this word retained senses like "magic spell" and "talisman", but these became obsolete in the sixteenth century (although derivatives like runam "secretly" and runastr "sorcerer" survive to the modern day).

Jo ney a l'oc run final yembr ny scarrad yarcer.

132.4: sce "wheelhouse"

sce /xe/ [çe]
- (historical) cathedral, the principal church of an (arch)diocese containing the episcopal throne;
- (historical, specifically) papal see, Holy See, the jurisdiction of a pope;
- venue, arena, stadium, theatre, the building in which an event happens;
- place, venue, setting, the place where anything happens;
- field, domain, the study of something in particular;
- (in the expression ne sce de) wheelhouse, bailiwick, domain, a person's area of authority or expertise

Etymology: originally in the first senses, descending via Old Borlish sce, sie "see, (arch)diocese" from Latin sedes "seat; residence; (Late Latin) episcopal see". Broadening to more general locations occurred in tandem with the import of cathedral to replace most of the religious senses. The idiom ne sce de "in the wheelhouse of" is attested from the 19th century.

J'admet ig no scey l'augrim a nacleu ne sce de mey.
/ʒadˈmɛt aj no xi loˈgrɪm a naˈklaw ne xe de mi/

132.5: Dime measures

The dime measures (less commonly known as the 'tithe measures' or 'tenth measures') are a modern system of units based on factors of ten. The name derives from the French dîme "one-tenth", from synonymous decimus in Latin.

The dime measures were codified during the nineteenth century for ease of communication, as theoretical development coalesced into a global endeavour. They have been updated several times since, as it has become feasible to use more convenient yardsticks.

Standard modifiers may be added to each unit to increase or decrease their size by factors of 10. In most common use are:

    great (10⁴)
    tithe (10⁻¹)
    petty (10⁻⁴)
    scant (10⁻⁸)

Length

There are three bases for dime lengths: the inch, the foot (10 inches) and the league (10⁴ feet). At first, the length of the foot was fixed somewhat arbitrarily as the midpoint of the very slightly different Roman foot and the Cathayan "surveyor's span". In 1946, the foot was redefined to make the normal speed [speed of light] (denoted œ) equal to precisely ten great leagues per second.

Several other traditional measures of length were given dime values. For instance, in dime measures the mile is equal to five thousand feet or half a league.
Heft [mass]

There are four bases for dime hefts: the scruple, the ounce (100 scruples), the tabre (100 ounces) and the ton (100 tabres). The third of these units takes its approximate value from the Persian mann and its name from the city of Tabris [Tabriz]. The ounce was originally defined to be the mass of a cube of water of side length one inch; this was later refined to specify that the water be at its triple point of pressure and temperature.
Derived units

Many units are defined in terms of these base units of length and heft, as well as the second. For example, the shove measures the might [force] required to accelerate a heft of one tabre to a speed of one foot per second.

133.2: quiðeyar "exhaust"

quiðeyar /ˌkwi.ðiˈjar/ [ˌkwiðˈjɐː]
- exhaust, tire, frazzle, (as of work) to be physically gruelling;
- tax, challenge, to be difficult to accomplish

Etymology: the descendant of Old Borlish quiðeȝar "sicken, nauseate; unsettle, rattle, unnerve", derived from dialectal quið "belly, stomach, intestines". This is a borrowing from Old English cwiþ "womb; stomach". The shift in meaning from disgust or emotional disturbance towards hard work is complete by the eighteenth century (although related forms in rural dialects retain some earlier senses).

Caye l'oç flaðr derran uncos quiðeyant.

##

133.3: çottar "slam"

çottar /tsɔˈtar/ [tsʊˈtɐː]
- slam, shove, bash, slug, to hit forcefully;
- fling, hurl, chuck, to throw forcefully

Etymology: from early 17th century çottar "beat, batter", which was borrowed via a Middlesea language (plausibly Napolitan zottà "flog") from Arabic noun سَوْط • (sawṭ) "whip". The word appears to have begun as naval slang, having acquired its modern meaning by the time it enters general use in the 18th century.

Çot y bal yert a haut eð atten a y laç cavir.
/tsɔt i bal jɛrt a hot e‿ðaˈtɛn a i lats kaˈvɪr/

##

133.4: monnocquar "trudge"

monnocquar /ˌmɔ.nɔˈkwar/ [ˌmɔ.nʊˈkwɐː]
- trudge, lumber, plod, traipse, to walk heavily or with some difficulty;
- struggle, persevere, to work on a task while finding it difficult

Etymology: first attested in the 18th century; further origin obscure. Attempts to connect the word "monk"—perhaps moigne or monhe from regional French and Portingale dialects respectively—stumble on phonetic grounds (and the proposed semantic connection of a monk's plodding gait is tenuous).

More tempting might be Arabic مَنْهُوك • (manhūk) "exhasuted, spent", although no account of the word's journey to Borlish has been corrobated. Claims of a Novomundine origin also lack convincing evidence. Perhaps simply an onomatopoeic or fanciful coinage.

Nos eyau monnocquar tras seg acr por ac yembr.

133.5: Chemical Etymology (cont.)

excerpts from the Veriloquace Glossary of Alchemy, a reference quire compiled by Rotcham University Primers [1].

athimar /ˈa.θɪˌmaː/ [antimony] the corporal [element] whose atoms have 51 mora, a reflecting grey half-metal known historically from its coholl [sulphide]. Around 1400 < Scholastic Latin athimāris "coholl of athimar" < synonymous Arabic إِثْمِد • 'ithmid, possibly from Copt. Applied to the corporal itself (as opposed to the ore) since the eighteenth century.

coholl /kʊˈhɔl/ [sulphide] any substance formed of brimstone [sulphur] and a metal—for example, fool's gold is a coholl of iron. 1610 < Vascon cohol "coholl of athimar [stibnite]" < Arabic كُحْل • kuḥl "eye-black", after the use of this substance as make-up. The term was generalised to all such metal compounds by Zaravcar in the late eighteenth century.

machovine /ˈma.kʊˈvəin/ [strontium] the corporal whose atoms have 38 mora, a yellow-grey metal. 1789 < Scholastic Latin machovīnus "machovine" < Machov, the town in Poland where the corporal was first isolated from the nearby mine's ore. The ash [carbonate] of machovine has seen use as a catalyst for the production of sugar from the braxoch beet.

maschale /məˈskɛːl/ [propionic acid] the acid oil [carboxylic acid] with a spine [carbon chain] of length three, a malodorous clear liquid. 1850 < Scholastic Latin maschāle < Ancient Greek μᾰσχᾰ́λη "armpit", after the substance's presence in human sweat as produced by skin zoia [microorganisms].

134.2: govon "hinge"

govon /goˈvɔn/ [gʊˈvɔn]
- hinge, a jointed device that allow the swinging of a door;
- pivot, axle, any thing on which something turns;
- centre of rotation, the point which remains fixed by a turning motion;
- pole, (in astronomy) either of the two points on the Earth's surface that intersect its axis of rotation;
- turning point, critical moment, an instant or decision with significant consequences;
- obsession, passion, fixation, the object of someone's obsessive interest

Etymology: originally in the first sense, the descendant of Old Borlish govon "hinge, tenon, pin". This reflects Vulgar Latin gōfō "nail, peg, dowel", a variant of synonymous gomphus in Classical Latin. The extension to a generic point of rotation (and from there to all other senses) had occurred by the Revitalist period.

Te stou moutessem y govon oglar.

134.3: effum "exhaust"

effum /ɛˈfɪm/ [ɪˈfɪm]
- exhaust, the gas released from a combustion engine;
- outgas, a gas emitted by any means (especially when considered as an unwanted waste product);
- hot air, bluster, bombast, long-winded or officious talk having no real substance

Etymology: borrowing in the 18th century from Scholastic Latin noun effūmus "emitted smoke, steam" and verb effūmō "I emit smoke, steam". These are derived from fūmus "smoke, steam" with the prefix ex- "out, away from". In metaphorical use the word is attested from the late 19th century.

gaheç /gaˈhɛts/ [gɐˈhɛts]
- locker, a storage compartment with a lock for securing personal possesions in a public space;
- lockbox, safe, a secure compartment for storing high-value items

Etymology: Middle Borlish borrowing via Vascon gaheç "lockbox" from Arabic قَفِيز • (qafīz) "a measure of dry volume".

134.5: A Motley Miscellany

The Bahassassin River [1] is the longest river on the continent of Mendeva [North America], with a total length of just over two thousand leagues. The river passes through multiple polities, including Sangathy and Hasiny, and its eastern tributaries descend from the Sturgovan Mountains [the Appalachians]. The largest city on the banks of the Bahassassin is Nadacow, the capital city of Hasiny. The name of the river comes from the Carovacian [Caddo] name báhassássin "mother of rivers".

[1] comprising the Missouri River and the portion of the Mississippi River downstream of St Louis.

Mark of Tolose (d. 1453) was the son of King Ambrose II of Vascony, and the father of King Ambrose III of Vascony. Although he was crown prince, he died three years before his father and thus never reigned. He married Margaret of Iscombe [Exeter] shortly before 1435. Along with Ambrose, they had three other children: their first child Alexandra, and two younger children Victor of Astorga and Natalia.

Wings Afire (Ale in Fiamme) is an opera written by Venetian Chiarina Bruno and first performed in the Verona Arena in 1824. It was the first work staged in the Verona Arena since it was shuttered at the outbreak of the Second German War.

The opera is a retelling of the legend of Icarus which takes place entirely after the events of the myth, with references to the dead Icarus in the dialogue. It follows the matron of a clothiery who meets a grieving Daedalus; she helps him to rediscover the joy of invention. The opera's music features the low-pitched mournful melodies of the graveyard fiddlers from Borlish folklore; Bruno is said to have heard of them from her brother Jacomo.

135.1: A Hotel in Nadacow

excerpt in translation from the early chapters of masquira trevold Men of Jet and Diamond, published (originally in Welsh as Dynnon o Vuhuð a Diamont) by Hasinick Welshman Cadogan Torrior in 1890, shortly after he graduated from the University of Nadacow as a scholar of diplomacy.

As the evening crowds make their way to the restaurant, Zoe starts to meander through the hotel's grand atrium.

135.2: fæx "pollutant"

fæx /fɛks/ [fɛks]
- slag, dross, waste products from some chemical process (including mining or combustion);
- waste, detritus, any discarded or unwanted material;
- pollutant, a harmful substance which contaminates the environment;
- (figuratively) dregs, scum, the worst and lowest part of something (especially of people)

Etymology: modern borrowing from Scholastic Latin faex "unwanted product of a chemical reaction", a specialised use of Classical faex "sediment, brine, rouge, dregs". Extension from scientific usage is attested from the eighteenth century, and its use as an insult is seen soon afterwards.

L'oc detaxion es aphlox psolic effumant com fæx ou?

runam /riˈnam/ [ʀɪˈnam]
- secretly, in secret, covertly, on the QT, not letting anyone else know about something;
- privately, in private, sub rosa, behind closed doors, in a setting conducive to secrecy

Etymology: from Middle Borlish runam "by magic, using sorcery; in secret, hidden from view" (the semantic shift mirroring that of "occult"). This is a derivative of contemporary run "symbol, spell, talisman" using the now-unproductive adverbial suffix -am, descending from Latin anima "soul" (compare kireðam "wholeheartedly", coram "in person").

Nos erau runam alleyant con lou commet a fin.
/nɔz eˈro riˈnam ˌa.liˈjant kɔn lu kɔˈmɛt a fɪn/

- memo, memorandum, note, reminder, a short bit of writing to prevent one forgetting something;
- summary, overview, précis, synopsis, a summarised description of something;
- brief, report, a description of events

Etymology: Middle Borlish borrowing from Latin breviārium "short piece of writing", from brevis "short". Originally restricted to legal contexts, the word had entered common usage by the sixteenth century.

No scerraun alcun imprefait ny brevier je posc.
/no xɛˈron al.kɪn ˌɪm.preˈfet ni breˈvjɛr ʒe pɔx/

135.5: Kernow

Kernow (Merch /ˈkɛː.nə/, Borlish Cornou /kɔʀˈnu/) refers to the north-western peninsula of Gaul. Known in antiquity as Armorica, Brittania or Dumnonia, it was resettled in the early medieval period by Kelt peoples from Albion.

History

The Kernovan kingdoms at the dawn of the eighth century had only recently been unified, ruled by widowed Queen Maud of Angeus. Her son Vigo ascended to the throne upon her death in 720, shortly after the Catumagin Accord which ended hostilities and established an official border with the Kingdom of the Franks. Vigo spearheaded the reconquest of Devon from the kingdom of Wessex, uniting the two peninsulas as the Kingdom of Greater Devon.

The polity suffered somewhat during the ninth and tenth centuries, with the encroachment of the Franks in the east and with extensive Viking raids along the coasts (the monastery at Landvennick was even burned to the ground in 888 N).

The region derives its modern name from the House of Kernow, which in the eleventh century took power by means of an alliance with Normandy. This Kernovan Conjuring led to the establishment of the First Drengot Empire, of which Kernow was a minor vassal.

The Brethin of Kernow enjoyed significant religious influence during the late medieval period.

Kernow became part of the Kingdom of Britain in the fifteenth century as it incorporated territories further afield from its heartland in Wales.

136.2: cleunfeyar "huddle"

cleunfeyar /ˌklawn.fiˈjar/ [ˌklawɱˈfjɐː]
- huddle, crowd, to stand close together;
- snuggle, cuddle, to be cosy or intimate with someone;
- clump, aggregate, to amass into a loose collection

Etymology: sixteenth century, verbal derivative of cleun "clump, lump" (now obsolete). This noun reflects Old Borlish cliun "ball, lump", a borrowing from synonymous clīewen in Old English which also gives e.g. Merch clewn "yarn".

N'entrant la jo lou veu cleunfeyant ag soufa.

jacas /ʒaˈkaz/ [ʝɐˈkaz]
- chatter, jabber, prattle, babble, inconsequential or childish talk;
- gossip, dirt, hearsay, scuttlebutt, idle talk about someone else's private affairs

Etymology: deverbal from jacassar "chatter; gossip", a borrowing from synonymous jacasser in French. This verb comes from jacasse "magpie; busybody", a derivative of the name Jacques. Possibly reinforced by the Merch jackass "male donkey".

Vos eð y jacas nuvr oïð ou?

136.4: infruniscent "bored"

infruniscent /ɪnˌfri.niˈxɛnt/ [ɪɱˌfʀi.nɪˈçɛnt]
- bored, disinterested, unenthusiastic, not feeling entertained or enjoyment;
- impatient, irritable, restive, wanting to move on from what one is currently doing

Etymology: Middle Borlish, negated participle of the verb frunir "to have fun, enjoy oneself". This is a borrowing from Latin frūnīscor "I enjoy", which was used non-Classically as an intransitive verb. In the latter senses it is attested from the eighteenth century.

Y stuðant infruniscent assisten y leiçoir.
/i stiˈðant ɪnˌfri.niˈxɛnt ˌa.sɪˈstɛn i liˈtsɔir/

136.5: The Novomund (briefly)

This term Novomund for the great landmasses of the western hemisphere is attested from the early sixteenth century, reflecting a univerbation of latin novus mundus "new world". 
Mendeva [North America]

The name Mendeva was formed backwards from Latin Mendevalēnsis "from Mendeva", attested already on the maps made during the 1471 Landfall (the demonym was later rederived as Mendevānus "Mendevan" from the placename). This comes from Vask [Basque] mendeval "west", itself likely a borrowing from Vascon vent de val "valley wind".

    Ambrosia [~Quebec, the Maritimes, New England] is a Vascony-settled polity named for King Ambrose III of Vascony (r. 1456–1518).
    Zangathy [~the Dakotas, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Winnipeg, Ontario] is a landlocked polity occupying the upriver Bahassassin [Mississippi] directly west of the Five Seas [Great Lakes]. Its name reflects Daccotan [Dakota] zaŋathi "flint region".
    New Provence [~New England, New York, and south as far as South Carolina] is a coastal polity extending westward to the Sturgovan Mountains [Appalachians] which grew from a series of trading post established by Provence merchants.
    Hasiny [~Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas, Oklahoma] is the largest polity in so-called British Mendeva, a few states along the Gulf settled by the Kingdom of Britain [~Wales, etc]. It takes its name from the Ractish [Caddo] name Hasíne "our people" for one of the previous nations the modern polity is descended from.
    Taisha [~Texas, Coahuila] is a minor polity of Gulf Mendeva at the crossroads of British and Morrack [Moroccan] influences. Its name comes via Arabic Tayisha' from Ractish taísha' "welcome".
    Mivock [~northern California] is a minor coastal polity on the Lovaqua [Pacific] known for its congenial climate. Of exceedingly sundry influence, its name reflects the name miwoc of the local Mendeva peoples and languages.
    Mashick [~Mexico, southern California, New Mexico, Arizona] is the largest polity in Lower Mendeva, the descendant of the Mashick [Aztec] Empire with heavy Morrack influence. Its name derives via Arabic from the Nawat [Nahuatl] meshi'ca' "Mashick people".

The Arcabil [~the Caribbean] are a collection of islands in the Atlantic, east of Mashick. They have a complicated history of influences from various Vetomundine powers. The name probably comes via the Arabic cognate of "archipelago".

    Cocain [~Cuba] is the largest of the islands of the Arcabil. Its name comes from the European folk tradition of a "land of plenty" (compare pays de Cocaigne, país de Cucanna, paese della Cuccagna).

Cappatia [South America]

European languages take the name Cappatia of this continent from Latin Cappātia, which comes via Arabic from Run'allo [Quechua] cappacha "this world".

    Tavancy [~Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Boliva, northern Chile] is major polity on the western coast, descended from the Tavancine [Inca] Empire. Its name comes from the Latin imperium tavantīnum, which was borrowed via Arabic as a partial calque from the Run'allo tawantin-suyu "the quartet of provinces".
    Staddomains, rather small polities, dot the eastern coast. These grew out of individual trading posts and have many different influences. Examples abound from Dutch influence in Neuwillem, Parnaven and Waronøu to Borlish influence in Monçating.
    Dowahine [~southern Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego] is a minor polity at the southern tip of Cappatia. Its name comes from the Arabic word for "smoke", after the smoke-towers sighted there by Captain al-Casmi in 1513.

137.1: The Henchmen of Zenda

excerpt in translation from the [real-life] book The Henchmen of Zenda by KJ Charles, a 2018 pastiche of the 1894 romp The Prisoner of Zenda.

137.2: reunç dy blad "roll of the dice"

reunç dy blad /raunts di blad/ [ʀauns di blad]
- roll of the dice, coin flip, shot in the dark, gamble, a risky or uncertain attempt at doing something;
- chance, opportunity, a time when one can try something (especially when one didn't expect to be able to do so)

Etymology: idiom attested from the eighteenth century, literally "flip of the card" and taken from gambling jargon. The word reunç "flip, inversion, return" is a noun from reuvr "come back, turn over", which descends directly from Latin revolvō "I roll over, I repeat". The word blad "playing card" is a borrowing from Saxon blad "leaf, page; playing card", cognate with blade in English.

M'orruð ig l'oc vellisqment sey un reunç dy blad.

137.3: tourf "furore"

tourf /turf/ [tʊːf]
- furore, uproar, outcry, tumult, a loud or angry commotion;
- protest, riot, demonstration, gathering of people in public to demand something

Etymology: early modern borrowing from Welsh twrf "disturbance; crowd, mob", itself originally a borrowing from Latin turba "disorder; throng". The word gained currency during the Democratic Wars of the mid-eighteenth century, form which it obtained its political undertones.

Jo fo sveilað je aubon posc par y tourf.

137.4: borjonnar "impend"

borjonnar /ˌbɔr.ʒɔˈnar/ [ˌbɔː.ʝʊˈnɐː]
- impend, forthcome, loom, be imminent, show signs of, to be about to start;
- bring forward, prepone, expedite, accelerate, to make something happen sooner

Etymology: Middle Borlish verb from borjon "bud; beginning, first sign", cognate with Old French burjon "bud, sprout". This is either from Frankish burio "offshoot, descendant", or from Latin burriō "down, fluff" (or both). Proscribed in the latter senses by stickler, although attestations are widespread from the 19th century.

Skig aular ag quarf ða cay ploy borjonnant.

137.5: The Dangers of DHMO

An illustration of the language Merch (the most widely-spoken language in the polity of Markland) through close analysis of the following example sentence.

Al as drink the leigh of aquifex ar sicker to dy.
/al əz dɾɪŋk ðə leːʃ ə‿ˌva.kwɪˈfɛks aː ˈsɪkə tə dəi/

Translated to IRL English with Boralverse jargon:

Everyone who drinks aquifex's lye will surely die.

Something which seems minor but which actually affects the aesthetic of Merch greatly is the lack of the "three-letter rule". In IRL English, almost all function words (nouns, adjectives, verbs) are at least three letters long. This rule is why we have such pairs as "inn - in" and "bee - be", as well as the redundant double letters in words like "ebb" and "egg". By contrast, Merch never did anything analogous, as can be seen here in the words al, ar and dy (cf "all", "are" and "die").

Merch also has somewhat less French influence than IRL English (while Kentish has somewhat *more*), due to the incomplete replacement of the English nobility there during the period of the Norman-ruled First Drengot Empire. Evidence of this in the above sentence is in the word sicker "certain" < Old English sicor, which lost out to French-derived "sure" in IRL English.

Grammatical differences on display here are: (1) the use of "as" in relative clauses, e.g. "the man as I love", "the man as loves me"; (2) more colloquial use of "be to VERB" with (non-volitional) future meaning, e.g. "the boats ar to sink!".

Finally, the scientific jargon in this alternate history is of course entirely different. The word leigh < OE lēag is cognate with IRL "lye; potassium/sodium hydroxide", and has been generalised to refer to any hydroxide substance. The word aquifex is a Scholastic Latin coinage (meaning "water-maker") for "hydrogen".

Thus we could informally convey the Merch sentence in IRL English as:
> Drinking hydrogen hydroxide has a 100% mortality rate.

Which of course it does—eventually.

138.2: soupleyar "bestow"

soupleyar /ˌsu.pliˈjar/ [ˌsu.plɪˈʝɐː]
- bestow, grant, impart, gift, confer, to present something to someone freely (especially as an honour or a sign of good favour);
- equip, render, supply, kit out with, to bring as provisions or equipment

Etymology: via Old Borlish sopleir "fill up, furnish, supply, provide" (later conflated with sopleȝar "require, take, consider necessary") from synonymous suppleō in Latin. Used for gifts originally in the context of granting land and titles to people.

Nos som plait de l'ambit agathiner vos soupleyar.

138.3: pre un cocoro "unexpectedly"

pre un cocoro /pre ɪn ˌko.koˈro/ [pʀe ɪŋ ˌko.kʊˈʀo]
- unexpectedly, without warning, suddenly, abruptly, unannounced, occurring in a way that could not have been predicted;
- all at once, overnight, instantly, in one fell swoop, as a single action with no intervening time in which to interrupt

Etymology: idiom attested from the 16th century, literally "before a cockcrow". The noun cocoro "cockcrow", here used figuratively to denote "first light, daybreak, dawn", is assuredly onomatopoeic in origin (as, ultimately, one assumes coq "cock, rooster" was).

Il se courn mariðað pre un cocoro.
/ɪl se ˈku.rn̩ ˌma.riˈðaθ pre ɪn ˌko.koˈro/

- soot, lampblack, particles of carbon and tar produced by incomplete combustion;
- blot, blemish, flaw, a mark of imperfection in or on a surface;
- rust, smut, any of various fungi which cause plant diseases

Etymology: via Old Borlish sui, suicle "soot" from synonymous sūdia, sūdicula in Insular Latin (compare French suie, Welsh huðygl, both meaning "soot"). In the more general uses the word is attested from the fifteenth century; the botanical senses date in writing to the seventeenth.

Y mur ne Damvað Veðerrem son pegntað con suicr.

138.5: Steeplepost Tapestry

The Steeplepost Tapestry (Vascon: Lo Tapìs Campanaral) was a screen of several myriad black or white tiles built in Ambrosia's capital city of Aiga d'Angoixa [~Quebec City]. Completed in 1820 and erected to overlook one of the city's central squares, it was inspired by the (fairly new) 'latticework' art movement.

One ambitious goal for the Tapestry was to be able to portray journalist's sketches of events from across the country with great speed, using the flag-lamp steeplemesh infrastructure that had been built up over the last few decades. Although this was achieved several times, the practical limitations of transmitting so much information by steeplepost prevented it from becoming routine. Instead, the majority of the tapestry's time was spent displaying short pieces of news or government messages in text and simple symbols.

The use of the word 'diced' to mean 'blocky, pixellated' dates back to a calque of Provincial icon dau 'die image'. This phrasing was coined in 1821 in disparaging reference to the Tapestry.

Just a few years into its operation, a series of hoax messages which spread rapidly via the Ambrosian steeplemesh made their way onto the Tapestry. These so-called 'Lies of 1824' included a report of the governor's death and culminated after several days with an alleged declaration of war from New Provence.

In 2020, a replica of the Tapestry was unveiled in Markland to mark the bicentenary of the original's completion.

139.1: Just a Man

translation into Borlish of the song Just a Man from the musical Epic, written by Jorge Rivera-Herrans.

Borlish:

    La jo te vey l'ec ogl a tey
    Jo memor l'oç heir a mey
    Tu n'a for sell'asc de cant eu jo ne var

    Mell'ec gest ou vaun ðocaç? Toll'enmig oustað?
    M'offirraun noghaç æternað?
    Quïsc ec ogl neðan y sigt osar
    Com poð jo t'oundrar?

    Jo no's for hom gimmolent a repaðr
    Jug lontan posc toll'annað deull'oç meyon amað
    Jo no's for hom y mort hasmant a strem
    Jo say tout volir por lou reveir, mell'heir e femn
    Jo no's for hom

    Ma cant es un comet denuð un assuvar?
    Cant es un bojay denuð un blas?
    Cant es un hom denuð un monstr?

    Cant es un ondol denuð un rasamar?
    Cant es y raçon denuð y blasm?
    Cant es un hom denuð un monstr?

    Absou mey (3v)
    Jo no's for hom

Literal translation:

    There I see these eye of yours
    I remember that son of mine
    You're only his age from when I went to war

    Do my acts deserve to plague me? All the slain enemies?
    Will they hit back at me with unending pain?
    Close your eyes so as not to dare see
    How can I wound you?

    I'm just a person striving for homecoming
    Still far after all the years from what I love
    I'm just a person resisting death utterly
    I know I'd do anything to see them again, my son and wife
    I'm just a person

    But when has a comet become a meteor?
    When has a candle become a blaze?
    When has a person become a monster?

    When has a ripple become a tidal wave?
    When has the reason become the blame?
    When has a person become a monster?

    Absolve me (x3)
    I'm just a person

Original lyrics:

    I look into your eyes and I
    Think back to the son of mine
    You're as old as he was when I left for war

    Will these actions haunt my days? Every man I've slain?
    Is the price I pay endless pain?
    Close your eyes and spare yourself the view
    How could I hurt you?

    I'm just a man who's trying to go home
    Even after all the years away from what I've known
    I'm just a man who's fighting for his life
    Deep down I would trade the world to see my son and wife
    I'm just a man

    But when does a comet become a meteor?
    When does a candle become a blaze?
    When does a man become a monster?

    When does a ripple become a tidal wave?
    When does the reason become the blame?
    When does a man become a monster?

    Forgive me (x3)
    I'm just a man

139.2: truc "shove"

truc /trɪk/ [tʀɪk]
- shove, thump, jab, jostle, tackle, thrust, a forceful push without gentleness;
- try, go, stab, an (especially unpractised or clumsy) attempt at doing something

Etymology: Old Borlish deverbal from truccar "shove, jostle" (now archaic, superseded by truc fair), which reflects a Vulgar Latin extension trūdicō of Classical trūdō "I shove, thrust". In the latter senses it is attested from the nineteenth century.

Un truc par ados me fey gringlar a cainç.
/ɪn trɪk par aˈdɔz me fi grɪnˈglar a kents/
[ɪn tʀɪk ˌpɐː‿ʀɐˈdɔz me fi gʀɪŋˈglɐː‿ʀa kens]

139.3: zovay cavir "take a taxi"

zovay cavir /zoˈve kaˈvɪr/ [zʊˈve kɐˈvɪː]
- take a taxi, go via cab, to travel somewhere as a passenger in a taxicab;
- take the easy way out, follow the path of least resistance, to take a course of action which requires minimal personal effort

Etymology: late ninetenth century, literally "to get (a) taxi". The noun zovay "taxi" is a clipping of earlier carrot zovay "taxi carriage", often mistakenly capitalised to carrot Zovay by analogy with other types of carriage named after places.

The word was borrowed via French from Furlain slang term zovaie "coach for hire with a taximeter", literally "convenience" (one did not have to pay up front, unlike earlier hired coaches). This is a derivative of verb zovà "be useful, be convenient", from Latin iuvō "I help; I please".

In the metaphorical sense the phrase is seen only from the 1970s.

Nos coum zovay eð alandaum tost.
/nɔz kum zoˈve ɛθ ˌa.lanˈdom tɔst/
[nɔz kum zʊˈve ɛ‿ˌða.lɐnˈdom tɔst]
1p get.pst-1p taxi and turn.up-pst-1p early

139.4: n'eç cahut "separately"

n'eç cahut /nɛts kaˈhɪt/ [ˌnɛs.kɐˈhɪt]
- apart, siloed, segregated, separated from each other into disjoint areas;
- separately, independently, without any communication or collaboration;
- estranged, alienated, no longer speaking to one another (especially after a falling out)

Etymology: idiom attested from the eighteenth century, literally meaning "in cabins". The noun cahut "cabin, dorm, sleeping quarters" is a Middle Borlish borrowing, originally in a naval context, from synonyous caihute in Middle Dutch. This is possibly a portmanteau of Old French cabane and hutte, both meaning "hut, shack".

The Borlish idiom appears roughly contemporaneously with cognate idioms in other languages, such as Merch's in cahutes "independently".

Jug sein y domn egrtumnesc n'eç cahut.
/ʒai sin i ˈdɔmn̩ ˌijr̩.tɪmˈnɛx nɛts kaˈhɪt/

139.5: Monarchs of Borland

collected notes on various monarchs of Borland.

Victor Rossetus 'the Red-haired' (fl. c6) was the first Prase of the Boral Diocese. He rose to prominence after the fall of the First Roman Empire and unified the urbanised east of the land while the west and south were settled by Anglians to form Angland and Southbar, respectively. It was under him that so-called 'Roman Borland' first began to succesfully repel the new settlers. By the late sixth century the Diocese of Boral had become a monarchy (described in retrospect as the First Kingdom of Borland), whose ruling dynasty claimed descent from Rossetus.

Jothey, King of Borland (fl. 898), known in Borlish as Joðeg /ʒoˈðij/, was the last ruler of the First Kingdom of Borland before it fell to the Danes in 898. Married to Brenna of Barrow, cousin of King Roderick of Dunclothe, they fled to neighbouring Southbar (and once Southbar also fell to Dane rule, to Kent).

In the first decade of the fifteenth century, Queen Natalia I and her husband King Joseph I ruled jointly. Their family had been and would continue to be beset by misfortune; all three of their sons predeceased them, as did their few male grandchildren (either in infancy or by misadventure). The succession crisis prompted by their deaths in 1411 and 1416 spelt the end of their dynasty.

From the ashes rose the Saulestran lineage of kings, whose banner comprised a white bar cutting a twilight-blue field. This dynasty would go on to last for over four hundred years until the dissolution of the Borlish monarchy itself.

Joseph III (d. 1534) was king of Borland, remembered for ruling the kingdom through the ravages of the Second Great Dying. Joseph never succeeded in producing a natural-born heir, despite several recognised yet illegitimate children by his various mistresses. Thus, after his death in 1534, he was succeeded to the throne by Brandon II, his nephew.

Natalia II (Borlish Natagl, abd. 1894) was the last queen of Borland before the dissolution of the monarchy. She abdicated on Revillon of 1894 during the political upheaval leading to the country joining the Drengot Collusion (several Borlish cities, although not the capital, had already joined as part of the New Urban Mesh).

140.2: nothe "forged"

nothe /noˈθe/ [nʊˈθe]
- bastard, illegitimate, born to unmarried parents (when this means one is not able to inherit something);
- counterfeit, forged, claiming falsely to be something genuine;
- spurious, specious, fallacious, superficially plausible but not in fact logically deducible;
- (botany, zoology) false, denoting various plants and animals which resemble but which are not other species

Etymology: Middle Borlish borrowing from Scholastic Latin notheus "illegitimate, bastard", a pleonastic extension of synonymous nothus in Classical Latin. Originally restricted to legal contexts (where it replaced terms like bort and cif which were considered vulgar), it is now in general use. The term coexists as a higher-register term with French-derived bastart, which is somewhat crass.

Nos yemoim toð pront scið y Jorala sta nothe.
/nɔz jeˈmɔim tɔθ prɔnt xɪθ i ˌʒo.raˈla sta noˈθe/

140.3: ðocaç "haunting"

ðocaç /ðoˈkats/ [ðʊˈkas]
- bedevilment, torment, vexation, the affliction of (especially mental) distress;
- trauma, haunting, hell, the aftereffects of terrible experiences

Etymology: noun derivation from the verb ðocar "harrow, till; afflict, bedevil, torment, haunt" with the pejorative suffix -aç (from Latin -āceus "shaped like"). The verb descends from Vulgar Latin adoccō "I till, harrow", an extension of the synonymous occō in Classical Latin. The verb gains its emotional senses in the sixteenth century.

Y ðocaç lour coy de dormir ec noit.
/i ðoˈkats lur kɔi de dɔrˈmɪr ɛk nɔit/

140.4: hamac "bunk"

hamac /haˈmak/ [hɐˈmak]
- bunk, berth, cot, one of a series of beds installed in rows or tiers (especially in a nautical context);
- hammock, a hanging bed made of cloth or netting;
- swing, a seat hanging from two cords or cables and free to move back and forth;
- (mechanics) oscillation, harmonic motion, the behaviour of an object undergoing a returning force proportional to its distance from equilibrium

Etymology: originally in the second sense, borrowed via Morrove Arabic همك · hamaca and French hamac from Tainow [Taino] hamaca "hammock". Extended in two directions, to various cramped sleeping arrangements aboard ships as well as to other swinging objects. The word's use in physics is attested from the nineteenth century.

Jo fey rongelon sur my hamac fin a quelt.
/ʒo fi ˌrɔn.geˈlɔn sɪr mi haˈmak fɪn a kwɛlt/

141.1: Vampire Film Review

excerpt in translation from Jacint Brunat's review of Zachariah, a horror film about a vampire released in 1950.

In an attempt to incorporate some of the more traditional aspects of vampire folklore, Kiawaman grants Zachariah mystic powers and has the heroes defeat him by means of a sanctified wooden stake (not, as in the book and in popular wisdom, by burning).

These new powers, in the hands of a better writer, could have set up a dynamic between Zachariah and Vania as artists of the same craft—instead, we are given the tired trope of a woman torn between the affections of two men.

ondolar /ˌɔn.doˈlar/ [ˌɔn.dʊˈlɐː]
- ripple, undulate, billow, roil, eddy, to move like the disturbed surface of a body of water;
- roll, wave, to be shaped with undulations (as of hills or hair);
- bristle, flinch, recoil, to react with surprise or annoyance

Etymology: directly from Late Latin undulō "I rise in waves, undulate", a derivation from the noun unda "wave, billow". In metaphorical use it is attested form the Middle Borlish period; the emotional extension from the seventeenth century.

Nos aulaum tras lau de collin ondolant.

141.3: runastr "sorcerer"

runastr /riˈnastr̩/ [ʀɪˈna.stɐ]
- sorcerer, magician, wizard, mage, warlock, a person who practices magic;
- performer, trickster, illusionist, escapologist, stage magician, a person who entertains an audiences with the impression of performing magic;
- whiz, ace, genius, someone who is very skilled;
- enigma, mystery, someone who astounds or who leaves one baffled

Etymology: Middle Borlish, derivative of run "magic spell, talisman" with the pejorative suffix -astr < Latin -aster "resembling, quasi-" (compare contemporaneous but now obsolete runart "sorcerer"). Originally restricted to those doing evil or harm with magic, the word had become a generic word for a magic user by the late eighteenth century. In the last senses it is seen in slang from the early twentieth century.

Ja ou vos ignorað comoscon y runastr l'acavau?

141.4: agathin "minister"

- minister, office-holder, official, chancellor, executive, secretary, a politician in charge of a government department;
- aide, advisor, councillor, member of a group of people advising a ruler
- (chess) queen, the piece located on on the back row in the d file

Etymology: from Middle Borlish, a borrowing from Scholastic Latin agathīnus "minister". This was altered by analogy to Greek ᾰ̓γᾰθός • agathós "good, noble, useful" from contemporary words like Italian agazzino and Barcelon agutzir "bailiff, sheriff". These originate in Arabic الوزير • al-wazīr "the minister", from which the chess sense also derives.

141.5: Provence

collected notes on the polity of Provence.

Provence (Doccian Proença /pʀuˈɛ.sɔ/) is a polity in the south of Gaul [France] on the Middlesea [Mediterranean] coast. It first became independent in 1499, and its capital city is Marsella [Marseille].

Toponymy
The name Provence descends directly from the Latin name Provincia Romana, so called as it was the first Roman province to be established on the Gaulish side of the Alps. The name of the polity's predominant language, Doccian, derives from the division of the French languages into the lengas d'oil (Northern, including Roun [Rouen] and Paris French) and the lengas d'oc (Southern, including Vascon and Doccian) depending on their word for "yes".

History
Medieval Provence was a vassal of various greater powers for almost a millennium. It was incorporated into the expanding Francian Empire in the sixth century and remained part of its western fragment after the empire was divided in two in the ninth. By the early eleventh century it had become mostly autonomous, but it was conquered once more as the last piece of the First Drengot Empire.

After the 1170 Emergency at Dijon, the Kingdom of Burgundy left Drengot control, taking the country of Provence with it. Provence was elevated to a duchy in the thirteenth century under the house of Savoy, and as the direct link between the capital at Geneva and all of Middlesea sea-trade, it became known as the panier de Borgogne (the 'Burgund breadbasket'). Provence was conquered by Vascony during the Vascon Ascendancy of the early fifteenth century, but was returned to Burgundy during the reign of Ambrose III in 1494.

Along with this political turmoil, the late fifteenth century saw extensive piracy in the Middlesea; in Marsella the raiding verged on occupation, and many of the wealthy fled to safer pastures inland. Aid requests presented to Rudolf VIII went largely unanswered, and things came to a head on the 21st of June 1497 when Daniel Menton (Lord Amigòt) led the local aristocracy in declaring independence from Geneva (to this day the 21st of June is a national holiday in Provence). The War of Provincial Independence lasted two years until Burgundy's defeat at the Battle of Margès.

Daniel Menton led the new republic for the next eighteen years, manoeuvring against a hungry Barcelon and their piratical allies who de facto ruled Marsella (it is generally understood that Lord Amigòt established Marsella as the capital of Provence in large part to closely monitor Jondumal's fleets). His successor and cousin, Antoin, ruled for only three years despite the guidance of his mentor and Daniel's friend Guillèn daus Sanz; the coming of the Second Great Dying ravaged the Amigòt dynasty and the Provincial people both.

The following decades saw independent Provence take its place as a preeminent mercantile republic. By the end of the sixteenth century their trade network reached across the Atlantic to port towns in Mendeva [North America] like the newly-established Santrafew. These towns would eventually coalesce into the territory of New Provence.

By the end of the nineteenth century, the power of New Provence had eclipsed that of its Vetomundine progenitor. As the Drengot Collusion formed to the north, Provence became in many respects a European outpost of New Provence, in a reversal of their respective statures centuries earlier. The region stood with Vascony as a bulwark against Drengot hegemony until the Furore of 1961 and the collapse of the Drengot Collusion.

142.2: beuscr "monster"

beuscr /bauxr̩/ [ˈbau.xɐ]
- monster, beast, an animal considered dangerous and violent;
- brute, lout, hooligan, thug, a person considered to behave like a mindless and violent beast;
- bro, dude, guy, an ironic term of approbation for a male friend (especially one who has just been particularly cool);
- (colloq, adv.) very, extremely, particularly, to a surprisingly great extent.

Etymology: somehwat muddled. The -scr ending likely descends from Latin diminutive suffix -usculus, here used in either a belittling or euphemistic sense. The rest is thought to reflect Latin bēlua "wild animal, beast", although the development of the /l/ is irregular.

In ironic usage it is attested from the early twentieth century; as a generic intensifier somewhat later. The derived comparative beuscerrem "to an even greater extent" is seen only very occasionally as a one-off neologism.

Pieç beuscr son tijon svingant sur y lançbal.

142.3: ec ogl quïr "close one's eyes"

ec ogl quïr /ɛk ɔil kwaiˈɪr/ [ɪˈgɔil kwɐˈʝɪː]
- close one's eyes, to cover one's eyes with one's eyelids so that one cannot see;
- ignore, turn a blind eye, to intentionally fail to recognise that something (usually bad) is happening

Etymology: fixed idiom literally meaning "to extinguish eyes". Both this and its opposite ec ogl accendr "open one's eyes, lit. light eyes" first appear in the early Middle Borlish period, presumably via the notion of making things light and dark. In metaphorical use the phrase is seen from the fifteenth century.

The noun ogl "eye" descends unproblematically from Latin oculus "eye"; the verb quïr "extinguish, darken; turn off, switch off" comes from Latin quiēscō "quieten, stop" after analogy to other inchoative verbs like finir < fīniō~fīniēscō "to finish".

Jo quïsceu ec ogl eð ençau a conteyar.
/ʒo ˌkwai.iˈxau ɛk ɔil ɛθ ɛnˈtso a ˌkɔn.tiˈjar/

142.4: oundrar "wound"

oundrar /unˈdrar/ [ʊnˈdʀɐː]
- wound, injure, hurt, harm, to cause an injury or similar harm to;
- damage, break, impair, to cause not to function correctly;
- offend, spite, insult, to hurt the feelings or honour of

Etymology: from Old Borlish (v)ounrar, oundar "wound, injure", a conflation of the descendant of Latin vulnerō "I wound" and the borrowing of Old Norse unda "to wound" (which are unrelated). The loss of the initial consonant would be unexpected if the Latin etymon was the only one; however, this was a regular feature of Old Norse.

M'orruð un hom ay my bos oundrað.

Tremonnow (Merch /tɾəˈmɔ.nə/, Welsh Trevonwy /ˌtɾe.vəˈnui/) [Monmouth] is a town in the southeast of Wales, the administrative centre of the district of Ux [1].

Toponymy

The name Tremonnow derives from the Welsh trew "town" and the name of the river it lies on, the Monnow (compare Welsh Mynwy "the Monnow", which is of unclear origin).

History

The lands around Tremonnow were conquered from the medieval Welsh kingdom of Guent [Gwent] by Vigo the Magnificent during the formation of the kingdom of Greater Devon in the first half of the eighth century.

The Christian order called the Brethin was founded in Tremonnow at some point before 800 N under the patronage of Vigo's daughter Iseld. The order would become renowned for their efforts at historical documentation, and their archives in what eventually became the modern Tremonnow Gravatory preserve invaluable sources on early medieval Albion [Great Britain] (including a copy of the Chronicle of Carlile [Carlisle]).

From the mid-twentieth century, the Tremonow Open School, formerly known as the Brethin Mesh Institute, provided distance learning in Welsh and Wessern [2] across Albion and, latterly, also across British Mendeva.

People
Dewock Barclythe (1452-1539 N), Friar of Tremonnow and for several decades the prime Factor of Records at the Brethin House there.

143.2: æternar "immortalise"

æternar /ˌe.tɛrˈnar/ [e.tɪːˈnɐː]
- perpetuate, continue, maintain, prolong, eternise, to make last indefinitely;
- immortalise, to cause to be renowned;
- memorialise, commemorate, mark, to ensure that someone or something is remembered

Etymology: early modern borrowing from Latin aeternō "I perpetuate, make renowned", a verbal derivative of aeternus "eternal, immortal" (compare much earlier adjective æternal "endless, eternal"). Made popular in the last senses after the Millstone War in the early twentieth century by its use in a Faðig war poem.

L'ec imascry voun l'Issambr a Lappier æternar.

##

143.3: rasamar "tsunami"

rasamar /ˌra.zaˈmar/ [ˌʀa.zɐˈmɐː]
- tsunami, tidal wave, a very large and destructive wave as caused by an earthquake or eruption;
- flood, onslaught, onrush, the sudden appearance of a large number or mass of things or people

Etymology: Middle Borlish, a univerbation of the earlier phrase ras a mar "onrush of sea". The now-obsolete word ras "rush, stampede, running" was borrowed either from Old English or Norse. In metaphorical use the word rasamar is attested from as early as the fifteenth century.

Sceye un rasamar de conement pront la y varous cof yert.
/xiˈje ɪn ˌra.zaˈmar de ˌko.neˈmɛnt prɔnt la i vaˈruz kɔf jɛːt/

143.4: assuvar "meteor"

assuvar /ˌa.siˈvar/ [ˌa.sɪˈvɐː]
- meteor, shooting star, a piece of extraterrestrial rock falling through the Earth's atmosphere;
- meteoroid, meteorite, such a piece of rock before it enters the Earth's atmosphere or after it has landed on the ground;
- harbinger, omen, herald, something that foretells the coming of some person or event (especially something bad)

Etymology: from Scholastic Latin assūvāris "meteor; meteoric", and specifically from the thirteenth-century work Dē Assūvāribus "On Meteoric (Phenomena)". This is a borrowing from Arabic شُهُب • shuhub "shooting stars", plural of شِهَاب • shihāb "blaze, brand; shooting star". In the last senses it reflects a long history of comets and similar celestial appearances being used to foretell the future.

Nos s'asseyau tras port e conteyau assuvar.
/nɔz ˌsa.siˈjo traz pɔrt e ˌkɔn.tiˈjo ˌa.siˈvar/

143.5: In the Solar System

    excerpt taken from 1936 work Tell Me Everything About the Solar System [1], part of the Tell Me, Telmy! series of children’s educational books. These were originally written by Adamara Godwilham [2] and featured a fictionalised version of her father Bartelmy, “Telmy”, acting as guide and entertainer. After her death she bequeathed the series to her publishers, Zizania Nexus, who have continued the series to the present day.

…found the four biggest jovial moons right in the middle of the Revitalist period. This time during the sixteenth century was when scholars and artists across the Middlesea [Mediterranean] and the Persias looked back to the works and beliefs of Classical Greece and Rome.

As word spread of the first really new celestial bodies to be discovered for thousands of years, people came up with lots of names for these pharī Iovis “lighthouses of Jove”. Some people wanted to bring glory to their patrons, lords or lands. Others reached to retellings of Classical legends which were in fashion.

The convention that has lasted in European languages, and which has been maintained since we have found many more small jovial moons in the last century, has been to name Jupiter’s gyrers [satellites] for his mortal descendants. We have done the same with the two moons of Mars, Dimus [Phobos] and Phobus [Deimos], which are named for his twin sons and attendants.

In myth, Æacos was the grandfather…

—

[1] originally published in Kentish as Tell Me Wrich by th'Ambit ot Son, pronounced /tɛl mə vʀɪtʃ bi θamˈbɪt ɔt sɔn/.

[2] Adamara is a feminine form of Adamar, from Classical German roots audas “wealth” and mēras “fame”. The surname, pronounced /ˈgwɪ.ləm/, is from placenames deriving from early Kentish godwille “fortune, blessing” and hamme “enclosure”.

144.2: cavir yert "boot up"

cavir yert /kaˈvɪr jɛrt/ [kɐˈvɪː ʝɛːt]
- wake up, come to, stir, to regain consciousness;
- turn on, switch on, activate, start, boot up, to begin operating;
- (of a business) open, to start serving customers

Etymology: early Modern Borlish idiom literally meaning "to get awake". The verb cavir "get" is a direct descendant of capiō "take, pick, recieve", used in the sense "become" since the Middle Borlish period. The adjective yert "awake, alert; (of a business) open" descends via Old Borlish yerte "standing, upright, vertical" and synonymous ērctus in Vulgar Latin from Classical ērēctus "raised, built, erected". Extended from people to machinery and thence to businesses by the nineteenth century.

J'attenoy cos infruniscent tandic y grimmour cave yert.

144.3: parsemnar "dot"

parsemnar /ˌpar.sɛmˈnar/ [ˌpɐː.sɪmˈnɐː]
- plant, sow, to throw (the seeds of a crop) onto fertile ground;
- spread, disperse, scatter, sprinkle, strew, to throw anywhere in such a manner;
- broadcast, disseminate, to make widely known;
- dot, stud, to place at regular or irregular intervals across the whole expanse of something

Etymology: Middle Borlish, either a native derivation of semnar "sow, plant" or directly from a Scholastic Latin perseminō "I sow throughout" (compare cognate pessembrar in Vascon). Almost immediately extended from its agricultural roots, and used of news since the seventeenth century.

Enceð a y novel parsemnar ig jo sail oc jorn.

144.4: congenir "conceive"

congenir /ˌkɔn.ʒeˈnɪr/ [ˌkɔɲ.ʝɪˈnɪː]
- conceive, beget, to have as a child;
- to be the ancestor of, more generally;
- create, generate, to bring into being;
- originate, invent, to be responsible for the existence of

Etymology: from Scholastic Latin congenēscō "I bring into being", a regularised derivative of gignō "I beget" (past participle genitus "begotten"). Originally restricted to familial legal contexts, the word had entered the wider lexicon via patent law by the early modern period. In modern usage the verb is preferentially used as an infinitive or participle, although conjugated forms are still well attested.

Y parol 'sauð' e 'veð' son congenið de Veðr Norresc.

144.5: Mashick

Mashick (Borlish Mascic /maˈxɪk/, Nawat Maishī'co /maiˈʃiːʔ.ko/, Mashick Arabic المشيق · al-Mashīq) is a polity in Lower Mendeva and in fact by land area the largest polity in all of Mendeva. At its greatest extent the then-Empire stretched as far northwest as Mivock.

Morrack vessels of the New World Company established trading relations in the late fifteenth century with the relatively-new Mashick Empire, which at that time was much more geographically restricted. The next decades saw many Novomundine crops make their way across the Atlantic from Mashick, including tashban and shockle.

Mashick (and, to the south, Tavancy) served as bases for exploration of Mendevan lands. Fleets charted as far afield as the Ax, and Mashick was used to exercise control over parts of the Arcabil and their growing riches.

Nineteenth-century Mashick was one of the hotbeds of the nascent political philosophy of Ubiquity. It lagged behind British Mendeva in the adoption of the new morals of the Household Renovation, although by the early twentieth century it had caught up (unlike the more regressive New Provence).

The Lovac Wars of the 1920s and 30s saw the first major bombing campaigns on civilian targets, including many cities in Mashick like Moshtar. The unrest and economic downturn following these wars, more than actual military losses, led to Mashick losing significant parts of its northern territory.

In the modern day Mashick is a major food exporter. Droughts in the late 1960s led to reduced amback and mause supplies and sharply rising prices for these fruits in the Vetomund.

- smite, to strike down in the manner of divine punishment;
- stupefy, stun, amaze, to leave incapacitated due to shock;
- charm, delight, enchant, to engender feelings of extreme happiness or infatuation in

Etymology: descendant via Old Borlish oustar "kill, slay; thwart, stop, defeat" from Latin obstō "oppose, block, hinder". Its more violent senses survive mostly through their use in early translations of the Bible into Borlish; the latter senses are more common in the modern language.

Y segr m'oustau des caucet.

- gallimaufry, medley, mishmash, miscellany, hodgepodge, assortment, an unstructured collection of various things;
- pixellation, the lowering of screen resolution due to expanding an image or for purposes of censorship/redaction

Etymology: borrowing from Napolitan emblemata "mosaic, tilework", itself from Latin emblēma "mosiac, marquetry" or directly from Greek ἔμβλημᾰ • émblēma "insertion, ornament; mosaic". Metaphorical extension is attested from the start; the last sense is a late twentieth-century innovation.

145.5: Furlain

Furlain (Merch pronunciation /fʊːˈləin/, endonym Furlagne /furˈlaɲə/) is a polity in the northeast of the Italian peninsula, whose principal cities are Verona and Odin. It borders Lombardy to the west, Bavarn to the north, Crain to the east, and Venise to the south.

History

During the Second Tetrarchy of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the March of Furlain was the southernmost part of the German Empire, at first a direct imperial vassal and later specifically consolidated under the suzerainty of the Kingdom of Bavarn. After the collapse of the German Empire in the thirteenth century, Furlain's most frequent rival became the Republic of Venise.

Furlain suffered a severe earthquake in 1348 which destroyed both the castle and cathedral in Odin [Udine]. Reference to this event is the first attestation of the word quagment "earthquake" in the Borlish language.

The armourcloth trend in women's fashion (which emulated men's military dress) began in Furlain during the Long Peace in the late eighteenth century. The local term voinacciale (from voina, a slang term for a soldier) was borrowed into several other languages to describe the style.

Troops from Furlain fought in the Second German War (1815–23), principally against Bavarn. Furlain was allied with such countries as Borland, with whom they undertook the disastrous Battle of Hulm in 1821.

145.7: 1st Lexember - des caucet "utterly"

des caucet /dɛz koˈtsɛt/ [dɛz kʊˈtsɛt]
- utterly, absolutely, downright, to the fullest extent possible;
- completely, totally, all the way, all-out, every inch, done to completion;
- irreversibly, irretrievably, irrevocably, in a way that cannot be taken back

Etymology: idiom attested from the late nineteenth century, literally "out of (one's) socks". Thought to have arisen in Damvath slang as a sexual metaphor (taking one's socks off prior to sleeping with someone), although in modern usage it is not considered at all obscene. The noun caucet "sock" is a diminutive of obsolete cauç "hose, stockings, tights", via Medieval Latin calcea from Classical calceus "boot".

Nos stou la javigar des caucet.

146.1: 2nd Lexember - deunx "close shave"

deunx /daunks/ [daunks]
- near thing, close call, close shave, a situation where an injury or other undesirable outcome is narrowly avoided;
- (interj.) an expression of shock or relief at such a situation;

deunx fair
- get lucky, dodge a bullet, to narrowly escape an undesirable outcome

Etymology: university slang among the Vithor New School's students, attested there from the eighteenth century and entering the wider lexicon some decades afterwards. The noun is a borrowing from Latin deunx "eleven twelfths", related to uncia "one twelfth". The story linking its modern usage to a twelve-man jury is almost certainly false; more likely is simply the sense of being almost but not quite the whole thing.

Nos farreu noc deunx cossy alcheðr.

collindar /ˌkɔ.lɪnˈdar/ [ˌkɔ.lɪnˈdɐː]
- abut, neighbour, border, to lie adjacent to (as of a piece of territory);
- run up against, bump into, to start encountering problems with;
- resemble, recall, to remind one of due to similarity

Etymology: regular descendant of Latin collimitō "I border on", from limitō "I delimit, bound". Alternatively, a derivation in the Old Borlish period from an unattested lindar or now-dialectal lint "fence". Extension to conceptual closeness is attested from the seventeenth century.

- verdant, green, lush, abundant with (especially new-grown) vegetation;
- rife, plentiful, abounding, present in large numbers;
- thriving, flourishing, prosperous, successful, characterised by happiness and achievements

Etymology: present participle of verdeyar "become green; flourish; abound", a verbal derivative of vert "green" (or directly from Vulgar Latin virdidiō "I turn green"). Metaphorical extensions parallel those in neighbouring Romance and Germanic languages.

roç /rɔts/ [ʀɔts]
- cabbie, taxi driver, driver hired by a passenger and paid according to the distance and time of the trip;
- cab, taxi, the vehicle driven by such a person

Etymology: early 20C from Napolitan rozzo "cabbie", further origin disputed. Formally identical with earlier rozzo "boor, lout", from Latin adjective rudis "rough, unskilled, rude", but this term seems to have been obsolete by the mid-19th century. Occasionally identified with dialect ruzza "wheel", from Latin rotula "small wheel, scroll".

- (loosely, informal) other team sports involving throwing a ball;
- hot potato, something which gets passed on rapidly due to nobody wanting to deal with it

Etymology: eighteenth-century compound from lançar "to throw" and bal "ball". The verb descends from Late Latin lanceō "I launch, shoot, pierce", a derivative of Classical lancea "javelin, spear". Compare caugtrbal "kickball, football", which dates from roughly the same time as a word but whose rules were standardised several decaded later than lineball. In the last sense the word is attested from the 1950s.

146.6: 7th Lexember - clacqment "clatter"

clacqment /klakˈmɛnt/ [klɐkˈmɛnt]
- clatter, rattle, a succession of loud and abrupt noises;
- gunfire, the sound of firearms being repeatedly shot;
- racket, din, commotion, ruckus, an environment of loud noise and disturbance;
- controversy, discord, strife, bitter conflict arousing much debate or even violence

Etymology: noun formation from clacquar "rattle, clatter, cause a disturbance". This was borrowed in the Middle Borlish period from contemporary French clacquer "clap, slap, slam", or directly from that word's Germanic origin (compare Willem or Kentish clacken "whack, shake"). Used for gunfire since the eighteenth century, and for general disruption from the nineteenth.

Jo sveilau des y clacqment a jarry jusser.
/ʒo sviˈlo dɛz i klakˈmɛnt a ʒaˈri ʒiˈsɛr/

146.7: 8th Lexember - inquillin "roommate"

inquillin /ˌɪn.kwɪˈlɪn/ [ˌɪŋ.kwɪˈlɪn]
- tenant, lodger, renter, one dwelling in a residence they do not own;
- roommate, dormmate, a person with whom one shares living quarters;
- (crude, euphemistic) bedfellow, bedmate, mistress, a sexual partner one lives with

Etymology: from Latin inquilīnus "sojourner, lodger; inmate", related to incolō "I inhabit". Influenced in sense by the unrelated noun quil "bed" and verb inquillir "embed"; these descend from Latin cubīle "bed, lair, kennel", which is related to cubō "I lie down". The euphemistic sexual sense has a possible citation in the seventeenth century, but is only securely attested in the nineteenth.

Deu mien, il s'ayen por inquillin!
/dau mjɛn | ɪl sɛˈjɛn pɔr ˌɪn.kwɪˈlɪn/

147.1: 9th Lexember - bount "en route"

bount /bunt/ [bunt]
- en route, heading, on the way, along the way, in the course of travelling from one place to another;
- directed, pointing, facing, oriented in a particular direction;
- determined, willing, intent, bent, wanting to do something;
- set, set up, ready, prepared, arranged as necessary ahead of time

Etymology: from Old Borlish boun "ready, willing", altered to bount by analogy with the present participle ending -nt by the early modern period. This is a borrowing from Old Norse búinn "adapted, fit", the past participle of búa "reside, prepare, decorate". In archaic or poetic use the word may be used as a preposition meaning "about to; approaching".

I me quistau por m'addocir ig bount son il ag quarf.
/i me kwɪˈsto pɔr ˌma.doˈtsɪr ai bunt sɔn ɪl ɛi kwarf/

There is a new friar at the hostel, less talkative and (if you will believe my wife) less handsome than Daniel.

More than anything he reminds me of the moralising mentor one sees in the dreadful morality plays they still show down in the city; he seems the sort to dream of visiting Rome and upon arriving declare it insufficiently Christian!

147.2: 10th Lexember - tourm "troop"

tourm /turm/ [tʊːm]
- troop, squadron, company, platoon, a body of soldiers;
- barracks, base, fort, fortification, encampment, a structure built for the (temporary or permanent) housing and mustering of soldiers;
- crew, squad, gang, a group of people brought together to do a particular task;
- team, group of people playing on the same side of a sport or game;
- swarm, colony, hive, collective noun for various insects

Etymology: Middle Borlish, via the conflation of contemporary French tourme "troop" and Dutch torem "tower, fort". The former is a borrowing from an Italian descendant of Latin turma "troop, team", while the latter is probably a borrowing from a Romance decendant of Latin turris "tower". As a collective noun it is attested from the sixteenth century for ants and somewhat later for some other animals.

Stoura un tourm ottem all'oc kevlar.
/stuˈra ɪn turm ˈɔ.tɛm aˈlɔk kɛˈvlar/

147.3: 11th Lexember - alcant aposc "eventually"

alcant aposc /alˈkant aˈpɔx/ [ɐˈgan.tɐˈpɔx]
- some day, in the future, eventually, at some point, after an unspecified amount of time;
- (interjection) about time, finally, jibe at someone or something taking a notionally excessive amount of time

Etymology: idiom found in this form since the eighteenth century, literally "once later". The adverb alcant "once" is an analogical form derived from cant "when" with the word element alc- < Latin aliquī "some". The adverb aposc "later" is from the preposition posc "after", from Latin post quid "after what". As an interjection it is only securely attested in the twentieth century.

Quippe l'oc havara un hom alcant aposc.
/kwɪˈpe lɔk ˌha.vaˈra ɪn ɔm alˈkant aˈpɔx/

147.4: 12th Lexember - tegmn "shelter"

tegmn /ˈtijmn̩/ [ˈtij.mɐn]
- shelter, cover, protection, refuge, a physical structure that keeps one safe;
- (specifically) shade, an area shielded from direct sunlight;
- buffer, cushion, anything used to isolate or minimise the effect of one thing on another;
- leeway, grace, wiggle room, freedom, flexibility, latitude, a range in which one can operate safely

Etymology: originally in the first senses, a direct descendant from Latin tegimen "cover, protection". This noun comes from verb tegō "I cover, conceal", which became Old Borlish ter "span, cover (an amount of land)" and thence modern teir "amount to, number". Extended to safety in more abstract contexts by the early modern period.

Jo duvau y bosaç con y tegmn d'un hey.
/ʒo diˈvo i boˈzats kɔn i ˈtij.mn̩ dɪn hi/

147.5: 13th Lexember - zizania "discord"

zizania /ˌzi.zaˈnja/ [ˌzi.zɐˈnja]
- discord, disharmony, dissonance, cacophony, a harsh combination of sounds;
- discord, tension, strife, dissension, arguing, lack of agreement of harmony between people;
- anguish, distress, angst, inner conflict;
- temptation, spite, vice, sin, feeling drawn to doing wicked things

Etymology: seventeenth-century borrowing from Lombard zizania "ryegrass, weed; discord, vice", which displays a metaphorical extension dating back to its ancestor in Late Latin zizanium "cockle, ryegrass, darnel; vice", a borrowing from Greek. Its modern association with cacophonous noise is probably due to sound symbolism.

Nos oyau zizania dereðr dy mur dy rajognoir.
/nɔz oˈjo ˌzi.zaˈnja deˈrɛðr̩ di mɪr di ˌra.ʒɔiˈnɔir/

All Change

collected notes on a variety of topics.

Vigo VII (fl. 1121) was king of Greater Devon [Devon, Conrwall, Brittany] in the twelfth century, which was a major vassal of the First Drengot Empire under Emperor Roger II (and later briefly under Roger's son). In 1121 N he invaded the south coast of Wales, attempting a reconquest of the southeastern Welsh principalities, without the support of the Emperor.

Zahid Russian is a Slavone language spoken in Crovatia, Servia and surrounding regions, although having little official recognition anywhere. Despite its current location it is mostly closely related to eastern Slavone languages like Kievan [~Ukrainian]; it descends from communities in the late medieval and early modern period who migrated westward due to the disruption of Islamic conquests from the south. The language is named за́хід • záhid, meaning "west". It is the source of some words in modern Merch (and other Englishes), such as rasgatto "dénouement", which comes via Venisian from Разгадто, a nineteenth-century mystery trevold by Olexi Harchenko.

New Skies, Old Stories (originally published in Provincial French as Novè Cial, Anzan Conte) is a work of popular history detailing the origins of the various threads of parachthon [scifi/fantasy] fiction. It was written by Simon d'Estiala and published by Prindor Marsillès in 1980. Its thesis is that many of the tropes often considered to have been invented by particular parachthon authors are in fact simply examples of existing tropes used in new settings.

Margaret of Iscombe [Exeter] (fl. 1435) was the wife of Mark of Tolose and the mother of King Ambrose III of Vascony. She married at some point shortly before 1435 N. She bore four children who survived infancy, including the future King Ambrose: her first child Alexandra and two younger children Victor (later Duke of Astorga) and Natalia.

147.6: 14th Lexember - a plaç entarn "some way in"

a plaç entarn /a plats ɛnˈtarn/ [ɐ ˈplats ɪnˈtɐːn]
- some way in, lodged, embedded, inside, located (usually not far) underneath the surface of something;
- along, at some point in the length of some object or space;
- during, at some point in the course of some time period;
- after a while, not at first, eventually, only at some time later than the beginning of something

Etymology: phrase meaning "at (a) position inside", used idiomatically from as early as the fourteenth century. The noun plaç "position" is an Old Borlish borrowing via Old French place "location" from Latin platea "courtyard". The adverb entarn "inside", which corresponds to the preposition ne "in", descends directly from Latin adjective internus "internal, interior".

Y melody dy sanfoin me hamtau a plaç entarn.
/i ˌme.loˈdi di sanˈfɔin me hamˈto a plats ɛnˈtarn/

147.7: 15th Lexember - kiveury "herdtale"

kiveury /ˌki.vauˈri/ [ˌki.vɐuˈʀi]
- herdtale, a genre of fiction originating in nineteenth-century Hasiny and depicting rural (prototypically, cattle-herding) life as a virtuous idyll;
- pastoralism, bucolicism, Arcadianism, the idealisation of rural life perceived as morally superior to urban modernity

Etymology: 19th-century derivative of kiveu "cattle, herd" with the suffix -ry "a collection of things, a shop, a gestalt quality", coined as a calque of Hasinic Welsh jadełath "herd-dom". The noun kiveu descends from Old Borlish kifew "cattle", a borrowing a Borland Old English cyfeoh "cattle-herd". To describe an ideology the term is seen from the early twentieth century, usually in critical contexts.

Jo cof un grivougl de kiveury ag quarvol.

148.1: 16th Lexember - prophthan "faster than light"

prophthan /prɔfˈθan/ [pʁʊfˈθan]
- faster than light, FTL, superluminal, travelling more quickly than the so-called "normal speed" of ten great leagues per second;
- (informal) at warp speed, double-time, lightning fast, with any extremely rapid pace

Etymology: coined in 1949 by Napolitan author Ludgia Pitceri as awareness of the normal speed entered popular culture and parachthon (fantasy/sci-fi) writers reached for various justifications for speedy interstellar travel. The word is a borrowing from Scholastic Greek προφθάνων • prophthánōn "preceding, overtaking", from φθάνω • phthánō "I precede, overtake". In its imprecise use the word is attested from the 1970s.

Capitan, cay uncos inovrant cas y motour prophthan.

148.2: 17th Lexember - ja sceint "extant"

ja sceint /ʒa xint/ [ʝa çint]
- extant, in existence, surviving, not yet having disappeared or died;
- attested, recorded, present, in evidence, proven to exist or have once existed;
- (orig. law) preexisting, being present before some other event (and thus having certain legal privileges or protections)

Etymology: phrase meaning "still being there", used as legal jargon from the early Middle Borlish period. The adverb ja "already, still, yet" descends directly from Latin iam "already, now" (the homonym ja "yes" is a Germanic borrowing and thus likely unrelated). The participle sceint "being there, existing" comes from the verb sceir "for there to be" used in existential sentences (scey uncos "there is something"). This descends via Old Borlish seer, sier, scer "exist, be located" from Latin sedeō "I sit".

Cay gravatoir y massem de descovan ja sceint dy siecr catorç.

148.3: 18th Lexember - ersteigon "climax"

ersteigon /ˌɛr.stiˈgɔn/ [ˌɛː.stɪˈgɔn]
- climax, the high point of a narrative or a piece of music;
- peak, apogee, zenith, acme, pinnacle, culmination, the highest point or best state of something;

l'ersteigon yembr "come to a head; reach a critical point"

Etymology: originally a term of art, borrowed from Saxon ersteigon "rise, climb, ascension", a noun from steige "climb". This properly referred to the events before the climax, but by the time of borrowing the shift in meaning had become entrenched. The term was used in more general contexts in Borlish by the mid-nineteenth century.

Y trevold de Docquerl es l'ersteigon dy commouð Futurist.

148.4: 19th Lexember - euxon "quartz"

euxon /aukˈsɔn/ [ɐukˈsɔn]
- quartz, an abundant mineral made of crystalline or amorphous silicon dioxide;
- jargon, technobabble, scientific words or concepts that do not (or appear to not) make any sense

Etymology: compare Scholastic Latin euxō "quartz" and Malchassian Greek εὔξώνας • euxṓnas "quartz", both first attested in the tweflth century. Traditionally connected to early Ancient Greek ἐΰξοος • eúxoos "well-polished" and the verb ξύω • xúō "scrape, polish", though this theory has some diachronic and semantic issues. The adjective is attested in Epic literature but no later, and moreover the root pertains very specifically to wood (being related to ξόανον xóanon "wooden image" and ξύλα • xúla "timber").

More recently it has been suggested that the word was borrowed into Latin (and then Greek) from a vernacular. Multiple early attestations have led scholars to propose that the word might have come from Borlish itself. If so, the most accepted theory is that the word is originally from attested Old English eolh-sond "amber", literally "elk-sand".

The latter sense is seen mostly in the idiom l'oc m'es euxon (literally "this is quartz to me"), used to express unfamiliarity with a technical field.

Y clocq parey l'hour con un scard d'euxon.
/i klɔk paˈri lur kɔn ɪn xard daukˈsɔn/

148.5: 20th Lexember - incommorant "immediate"

incommorant /ɪnˌkɔ.moˈrant/ [ɪŋˌkɔ.mʊˈʀant]
- immediate, instant, happening straight away;
- expeditious, speedy, acting with efficiency and rapidity;
- proactive, driven, showing initiative and acting without delay;
- punctual, prompt, timely, acting or happening on time

Etymology: Middle Borlish borrowing from Scholastic Latin incommorāns "not lingering; not delaying", a derivative of the root moror "I linger, loiter" (compare also commorar "tarry", borrowed or backformed somewhat later).

Sell'ec gest volen rebondir cos incommorant.
/ˈsɛ.lɛk ʒɛst voˈlɛn ˌre.bɔnˈdɪr kɔz ɪnˌkɔ.moˈrant/

The Fourteenth Century

collected notes on various features of the fourteenth century.

Nicolas of Avignon (Provincial Nicolà s Avignon /ni.koˈlɔ sa.viˈɲũ/, fl. 1347) was a renowned Burgund architect. He is principally remembered for leading the renovation and expansion of Saint Sophia's Cathedral in Stamboul, the capital city of the Second Roman Empire. His use of experimental techniques in supporting the central dome are alleged to have rendered the entire main body of the cathedral slightly unstable. For this reason he is sometimes jocularly referred to as the "architect of the Empire's demise", given the tragic collapse of the building during a coronation ceremony three hundred years later that killed most of the imperial family (and hundreds more) and sparked the unrest that would end the Empire for good.

The Noccair Lyceum (Borlish Lyce a Noccair /liˈtse a nɔˈker/) was established in the early 1300s in the minor town of Noccair; it was the first institute of higher learning on Borland. Like many similar European universities, it initially taught students the so-called Five Romantic Arts of literature, argument, reckoning, geometry and songcraft. By the end of the century alchemy had been introduced to the curriculum.

The Tales of Enfield Wood was a compendium of folk tales compiled in Kent in the late fourteenth century. It is usually credited to the author John of Yare, although this has been questioned. It contains many interpretations of episodes in the life of the Farmer Duke, a folk hero common to English-speaking peoples, as well as demonstrating the growing divergence between the Kentish and Merch tongues.

148.6: 21th Lexember - grivougl "scrawl"

grivougl /griˈvuil/ [gʀɪˈvuil]
- scrawl, scribble, chickenscratch, illegible handwriting;
- potboiler, shlock, hackwork, a written work of no artistic merit

Etymology: deverbal noun from grivoglar "scrawl, scribble, write illegibly", a borrowing via synonymous French grivouiller from Willem criblen "scratch". The second sense is attested from the early twentieth century.

Quippe porra tu noc my grivougl leir.
/kwɪˈpe pɔˈra ti nɔk mi griˈvuil lir/

148.7: 22th Lexember - piver "livestock"

piver /piˈvɛr/ [pɪˈvɛː]
- livestock, cattle, farm animals, creatures domesticated for any type of cultivation;
- breeding, husbandry, ranching, the cultivation of domesticated animals;
- (work that is) practical, hands-on, experiential, first-hand experience as opposed to theoretical knowledge

Etymology: via Old Borlish peȝvair "livestock" from Latin pecuārius "pertaining to sheep or cattle", from pecū "domestic animals". In the last sense attested from the early modern period, especially in constructions like y piver de X "the practical skills required to do X".

L'Agathin a Ðar derra nis prestar ag stoccad cas piver.

149.1: 23rd Lexember - nuton "fad"

nuton /niˈtɔn/ [nɪˈtɔn]
- will-o'-the-wisp, marshlight, ignis fatuus, a pale flickering light appearing at night over swampland;
- caprice, whim, fancy, vagary, an idle impulse or idea;
- fad, fashion, craze, rage, a short-lived general public interest in something

Etymology: Middle Borlish borrowing from various French forms such as luiton, nuitin, lutin, neton, all meaning "sea monster; mischievous spirit; will-o'-the-wisp". These appear to have been influenced by luire "shine" and nuit "night"; the oldest form is netun "sea monster", which descends from Latin Neptunus "the sea god Neptune".

The second sense is seen from as early as the sixteenth century; the last only in the twentieth.

Lor sceye un nuton a tapeçment e pieðr nuaç.
/lɔr xiˈje ɪn niˈtɔn a ˌta.pɛtsˈmɛnt e ˈpjɛðr̩ njats/

Question 1: How did Britain retain its position of cultural prestige over British Mendeva during the final years of the nineteenth century even as the latter overtook Britain in population and industry, and to what extent were the ethics of the Household Renovation exported to the Novomund via this cachet?

149.2: 24th Lexember - revottaç "tantrum"

revottaç /ˌre.vɔˈtats/ [ˌʀe.vʊˈtats]
- tantrum, fit, outburst, pique, apoplexy, a contemptible display of bad temper;
- scene, disruption, embarrassment, the result of somebody having a tantrum

Etymology: pejorative derivation from revot "annoyance, irritation". This is an alteration of earlier raivot, diminutive of now-obsolete raif "rage", which descends from Late Latin rabia "rage" (the usual modern word is voudy, a borrowing). The word is considered impolite as a description of an adult's behaviour.

J'oye un revottaç allors nell'oc varosset.
/ʒɔˈje ɪn ˌre.vɔˈtats aˈlɔrz nɛˈlɔk ˌva.rɔˈsɛt/

149.3: 25th Lexember - errevour "saviour"

errevour /ˌɛ.reˈvur/ [ˌɛ.ʀɪˈvʊː]
- saviour, rescuer, deliverer, person who prevents danger or harm befalling another;
- the Redeemer, the figure of Jesus Christ in his role as deliverer from sin;
- (attributive, of meat) stuffed with a particular combination of breadcrumbs, wine, herbs and chestnuts

Etymology: descendant of Old Borlish erevor "saviour", agentive derivation of erevre, erever "save" (which gives modern errevir "rescue"). This comes from Latin ēripiō "I set free; I remove", related to rapiō "I grab, seize". The term has been applied to Christ along with similar sauvour, reðentor "saviour" since the tenth century. In the last sense referring to a preparation of meat now often served around Christmas on Borland (although historically it, minus the chestnuts, was usually eaten on Easter Sunday).

Gehennant ig nos ayau porc errevour tost y dou por y fest.
/ˌʒe.hɛˈnant ai nɔz eˈjo pɔrk ˌɛ.reˈvur tɔst i du pɔr i fɛst/

##

149.4: 26th Lexember - scop "idea"

scop /xɔp/ [xɔp]
- aim, end, purpose, point, goal, what something is intended to achieve;
- crux, heart, gist, essence, thrust, pith, the central idea of a longer or more complicated matter;
- idea, conceit, a summary of the novel part of a piece of fiction

Etymology: Middle Borlish borrowing from Tuscan scopo "purpose, point", which descends from Latin scopus "target". This was borrowed from σκοπός • skopós "watcher; target" in Ancient Greek. The second sense is attested from the seventeenth century; the last only in literary criticism of the twentieth.

Jo poðe noc me quottar ag scop dy trevold parachthon.
/ʒo poˈðe nɔk me kwɔˈtar ɛi xɔp di treˈvɔld ˌpa.rakˈθɔn/

149.5: 27th Lexember - demastr "judgemental"

demastr /deˈmastr̩/ [dɪˈma.stɐ]
- judgemental, moralising, opinionated, critical, quick to form (especially negative) opinions of things or people;
- overstepping, butting in, inserting one's opinions when they aren't welcome;
- hypocritical, holier-than-thou, snobby, sanctimonious, having an inflated sense of one's own moral high ground

Etymology: derivation from demar "to opine, to express an opinion" with -astr, a pejorative suffix. The verb was borrowed in the tenth century from Old English dēman "judge, decide". First attested in the eighteenth century as the name of a character in one of Tamottan's satirical dramas.

I reconnosc ou sy fraðr sey tan demastr?
/i ˌre.kɔˈnɔx u si fraðr̩ si tan deˈmastr̩/

Revisionist History

excerpted from The Realignment of Borlish Inflection and Derivation, an article in the Winter 1909 issue of Theoretical Uncoverings in the History of Languages. This is a venerable scientific journal published at that time through the University of Lester [Leicester].

…undeniable that the modern form -aurn of the first conjugation's third-person plural preterite, as well as its ancestor in Old Borlish -avren /-ˈau.rən/, would descend regularly from the Latin *pluperfect* -āvĕrant and is less straightforward a reflex of the Latin perfect -āvērunt (from which we would naïvely expect modern Borlish -eirn). Nevertheless, the attestation, though rare, of syncopated perfect -ārunt (from which Vascon -aron, among many others) offers a plausible direct ancestor. This is especially tempting if we are permitted to assume influence from the other persons of the Borlish preterite, all of which employ an -au- theme.

We turn to perhaps the most contentious claim of this article. The fate of the Latin occupational suffix -ātor in Borlish has been a perennial puzzle since Bughter noted that modern Borlish -our cannot be its simple reflex. It was possible to suspect that an early -aðour or -dour was reduced, but absolutely no evidence of such forms has emerged from any medieval manuscript (the word saðour "farmer" is not a counterexample, as the connection of Latin sator to the verb serō "I sow" was opaque). This further precludes the possibility of mere analogy from third-conjugation verbs (Old Borlish corsor "runner" < Latin cursor), which would have taken time to spread to the much more numerous first-conjugation verbs.

One might also attempt to claim the Borlish suffix is a borrowing from one of the French languages, most of which lost -t- entirely between vowels (e.g. Old French chant(e)or "singer" < cantatorem). We do not deny that such forms reinforced -or in Old Borlish, but the suffix is manifestly native, appearing productively as early as the eighth-century Halvuy chronicle. Our new proposal begins from a few aberrant words in modern dialects and extends back to the first decades of Roman Borland.

Now restricted to northern dialects, the term orrel "penis" is…

149.6: 28th Lexember - sontiçtað "linchpin"

sontiçtað /ˌsɔn.tɪtsˈtaθ/ [ˌsɔn.tɪˈstah]
- criticality, necessity, exigency, requirement, the state of needing something (especially when there are significant negative consequences for lacking it);
- linchpin, mainstay, backbone, keystone, sine qua non, a person or thing that is critical to a system working or even existing`

Etymology: borrowed from Scholastic Latin sonticitās "urgency, exigency" or a derivation within Middle Borlish from sontic "urgent, critical" < Latin sonticus "dangerous, serious". The word has been used to refer to a necessary thing or person since the eighteenth century.

Desmettað noc y sontiçtað de nossell'entrpris!
/ˌdɛ.zmɛˈtaθ nɔk i ˌsɔn.tɪtsˈtaθ de ˌnɔ.sɛˌlɛntr̩ˈprɪz/

149.7: 29th Lexember - taur aïr "look forward"

taur aïr /tor ɛˈjir/ [toː‿ʀɪˈʝɪː]
- look forward, anticipate, to await with eagerness;
- be eager, be excited, to feel enthusiasm;
- be raring, be antsy, to feel impatience;
- (colloquial, dated) be horny, to feel arousal

Etymology: literally "to have bull", idiom attested (in the slightly different sense of impulsiveness) from the sixteenth century. The noun taur was altered from early Middle Borlish tor to be closer to Latin taurus "bull, steer". The last sense is attested sporadically from the late nineteenth century and reached its peak popularity in the mid-twentieth.

Nos orruðe casc y gent ausn taur a ençar destr.
/nɔz ˌɔ.riˈðe kax i ʒɛnt ozn̩ tor a ɛnˈtsar dɛstr̩/

150.1: 30th Lexember - sdegn "scorn"

sdegn /zdijn/ [zdɪjn]
- scorn, contempt, disdain, displaying one's feelings that something is inferior or vulgar;
- flak, criticism, bad press, censure, disparaging remarks made towards someone or something

Etymology: deverbal noun from sdegnar "scorn, malign", a derivative of archaic degnar "deign, condescend, begrudge", which comes from Latin dignō "I deem worthy". The word nowadays often connotes that the criticism is undeserved (compare the phrase sdegn accarr "to be wrongly criticised").

A sy lasc novel scey un tombr a sdegn.

Jem stared at the words.

Lou remane tars eð accusant, hetrous demay sur y lettr tachygraphað lou intermanent, ben y papiraç frail lou portant.
They sat stark and accusatory, too brutal for the typewritten letters that made them, or the thin cheap paper that bore them.

The ink was a little faded, as though the typewriter’s ribbon was almost worn out.

150.2: 31st Lexember - scaur ag mur ne Pompeï "write one's name in the history books"

scaur ag mur ne Pompeï /xor ɛi mɪr ne ˌpɔm.piˈji/ [xoː‿ʀɛi mɪː ne ˌpɔm.pɪˈʝi]
- write one's name in the history books, make a name for oneself, to do things which will cause one to be renowned for a long time;
- act with posterity in mind, to be conscious of one's legacy when deciding one's actions;
- (jocular) make last-minute revisions, to make rushed changes due to having little time left before a deadline

Etymology: literally "to write on the walls of Pompeii", first attested as an idiom in Napolitan some years after the unearthing of the ruins of Pompeii and the uncovering of its trove of graffiti. The verb scaur "write", which displaced now-obsolete or poetic scrir "write", descends from Latin scalpō "I scratch; I engrave". The last sense, attested in Borlish since the 1920s, refers directly to the volcanic eruption of 79N which buried the city.

L'oç segr es dignt tojorn i vil scaur ag mur ne Pompeï.
/lɔts ˈsijr̩ ɛz daint toˈʒɔrn i vɪl xor ɛi mɪr ne ˌpɔm.piˈji/

150.3: bucol "idyll"

bucol /biˈkɔl/ [bɪˈkɔl]
- idyll, haven, paradise, solace, oasis, a peaceful location or circumstance especially in the countryside;
- respite, break, relief, lull, a (usually temporary) decrease in stress or difficulty;
- reverie, daydream, idle and pleasant thoughts

Etymology: Middle Borlish, a backformation from earlier adjective bucolic "idyllic, peaceful", a borrowing from Latin bucolicus "pastoral, rustic". The word had broadened from the first senses by the late eighteenth century, and has been used for purely mental peace since the early twentieth.

Jo kiglau l'oç seyon rovað dec j'er bucol hamtant.

150.4: coyol "cone"

coyol /kɔˈjɔl/ [kʊˈʝɔl]
- (geometry) cone, the surface formed by rotating a deflected line segment around its end (or the solid thus circumscribed);
- anything conical;
- spire, point, a tapering structure built to cap a roof or tower;
- acme, zenith, peak, cap, summit, the best or highest-quality type of something;
- cap, coif, bonnet, a piece of headgear covering the top and sides of the head

Etymology: via Old Borlish coȝol "hood; cone" from Latin cucūlla "hood, cowl; conical wrapper or case". Used consistently to translate Scholastic Latin cōnus "cone" in geometrical texts since the fourteenth century (possibly the unrelated con "with" discouraged directly borrowing that Latin). In the modern language restricted to detached headgear that is at least vaguely conical.

Y coyol dy cligs es coup de fourraç mout cavent.

150.5: H is for History

collected notes on three features of the Boralverse alternate history that begin with the letter H.

Hasinic Welsh (Cambroec Hasinia /kəmˈbreːk həˈziː.njə/) is one of the primary languages of Hasiny [~S Mississippi River], along with the Mendevan language of Jaughta [~Choctaw]. It is mutually intelligible with other varieties of Welsh, although its orthography uses a different standard to British or Chrysian [Australian] Welsh. A few English words come via this language, like herdtale (a calque of jadełath "herd-dom") and sobot "radio" (originating in Jaughta çobota "message").

Hatfell Honours (Merch /ˈhat.fəl ˈɔ.nəz/) refer to several prizes awarded since the early twentieth century to artists in various fields across the Drengot Collusion (and, after that alliance-federacy collapsed in 1961, across all of Gaul and the Northwestern Isles [Ireland, GB, Borland]). The Honours in literature and drama are among the original set of prizes, while new arts have been admitted as recently as the 2010s. The Honours are named for Hatfell [Hatfield, Hertfordshire], a northern town in London near the border with Markland which was home to a collective of renowned authors in the nineteenth century. In 1918, the writer Dorotha Quistack won a Hatfell Honour for one of her adolescences [coming-of-age novels].

Hostilian (in Borlish often Stiglan /staiˈlan/, latinised as Hostīliānus) was a Borlish monk in the ninth century, often considered the father of Borlish history. His most famous work Historiæ Terrarum Boralensium "Histories of the Borlish Lands" is a semi-mythic account of Borland for the past five centuries since the arrival of Germanic peoples on the island. It includes a continuous list of rulers from Prase Victor Rossetus, several of which are not attested in any other source. This has led some historiographers to conclude that Hostilian was commissioned by the contemporary monarchy to legitimise their rule.

151.1: The Odyssey

excerpt in translation from the beginning of the Odyssey, as translated into prose Borlish from the original Epic Greek by Rosctey Villautin in 1910. The translation has been criticised for hewing too closely to the Greek syntax at the expense of sounding natural in Borlish.

D'un segr racont mey, Mus, mout tornant, oc magn lað
Of a man tell me, Muse, often turning, who very widely

sgarant, posc y citað sagntað a Troy i devastau;
wandered, after the holy city of Troy he sacked;

##

151.2: nienter "void"

nienter /njɛnˈtɛr/ [njɪnˈtɛː]
- (rare) void, empty, vacant, not filled or occupied;
- useless, ineffective, futile, vain, not producing any effect;
- invalid, worthless, without legal force or other analogous use;
- nihilist, pessimistic, holding that things do not have any point or purpose

Etymology: adjective derivation from nien "nothing" (earlier nient), which reflects either nē gentem "no person" or nē entem "no being" in Late Latin. Even in early texts the word has seldom been used literally (competing with vogt "empty"); senses to the effect of "amounting to nothing" predominate.

L'arra oç saut ig caye sy mariðaç dovem nienter.

151.3: scanjon "climb"

scanjon /xanˈʒɔn/ [xɐnˈʝɔn]
- rise, ascent, climb, an increase in elevation;
- upgrade, uplift, overhaul, improvement, the replacement or betterment of something to have new or renewed features;
- boom, bonanza, a period of wealth or prestige

Etymology: noun from scandr "rise, climb" or directly from Latin scansiō "a climbing", from Latin scandō "I climb". The word is attested in metaphorical uses from the sixteenth century, and in its specifically economic sense it is seen from the nineteenth century.

151.4: borel "idiot"

borel /boˈrɛl/ [bʊˈʀɛl]
- idiot, fool, numpty, nincompoop, numbskull, dunderhead, a person lacking intelligence or common sense;
- sap, patsy, rube, chump, schmuck, a person who is notably naïve and easy to dupe;
- yokel, bumpkin, rustic, an unsophisticated person from a rural area

Etymology: disputed. The word is seen from the early Middle Borlish period with indeterminate meaning. Possibly a diminutive from an unattested *bour "peasant", which would have been borrowed from Old English (ġe)būr "farmer". Otherwise, perhaps a direct descendant from Latin puerīlis "youthful; childish". However, both explanations require somewhat irregular sound changes.

151.5: War and Peace

Mystra (in full the Principality of Mystra; Greek: Δεσποτᾶτον τοῦ Μυστρᾶ) was a mordether [crusader] state founded in the eleventh century in the Peloponnese. The holy order of soldiers known as the Convoy Australier was instrumental in conquering the peninsula as a staging post for further attempts at conquest in the Masreck [Levant]. It was named for its then-capital, the city of Mystras. Originally independent, the polity was after some decades reincorporated into the resurgent Roman Empire, and the capital eventually moved to Mysarnos [Pylos]. Mystra was formally dissolved in the mid-seventeenth century as a result of the Romantic Wars.

New Leudong (Welsh: Leudong Newð /ˌlyːˈdɔŋ ˈnawð/) is a polity covering the southeast portion of Chrysia [Australia]. Named for the Cathayan state of Leudong, it has experienced significant Cathayan nation-building alongside British settlement since the late seventeenth century. In the early eighteenth century the trade network of Gurjat [Gujarat] extended as far as New Leudong. Born in New Leudong, mixed-heritage writer Pether Hetsong penned semi-autobiographical work The Land of Golden Lies and Sugared Fire in 1864, often considered the first Chrysian work of literature to enjoy Vetomundine [Eurasian] success. New Leudong was an early adopter of the new social mores of the Household Renovation in the late nineteenth century. A collaboration involving the Branwen Sanatory in New Leudong's capital invented the chemical painkiller cozebdo-diamaschal benjamine [ibuprofen]. In the late twentieth century the New Leudong city of Mehannin [Brisbane] became a technological hub, spurring developments in grimmer [computer] design and methodics [programming].

152.1: Apprenticeship

excerpt in translation from Guillotine Hadjatoux's 2001 trevold Tyrocinie "Apprenticeship", her first in a series of deconstructionist tales alluding to tropes in parachthon [specfic] fiction from unexpected points of view.

Y figl de casc gent reuloirn des y campagn autrað. Il stan veilessem, cos primer.
Everyone's children came back from the country changed. They were older, for a start.

Some of them were wilder, and some had no manners—some had transmogrified into country children with not a trace of Paris in them, complete with accent.

152.2: præmiar "reward"

præmiar /preˈmjar/ [pʀɪˈmjɐː]
- reward, recompense, honour, to recognise (some achievement) and give some boon for it;
- incentivise, encourage, motivate, to incite (an action) by giving something as a reward for doing it

Etymology: borrowed from Scholastic Latin præmiō "I reward, honour", a verbal derivative from præmium "profit, prize, bribe". Though the verb was once poetically used with the person rewarded as the direct object, now only the honourable act itself may take that position.

Nos visau y costroinç de randy præmiar.

152.3: rustr "rural"

rustr /ˈrɪstr̩/ [ˈʀɪ.stɐ]
- rural, agrarian, rustic, of the countryside away from urban areas;
- provincial, backwoods, boorish, unsophisticated, unrefined, narrowminded, having a worldview considered typical of rural people;
- uncouth, awkward, clumsy, bumbling, unaware of niceties or unable to competently observe them

Etymology: from Old Borlish rustre "rural", either directly from Latin rūsticus "rural" or via synonymous rustre in Old French. The insulting senses date as far back as Classical times, and may have been reintroduced during the Middle Borlish period.

Me stoura Janvier passar con gent rustr.

152.4: bosaç "gunfire"

bosaç /boˈzats/ [bʊˈzas]
- gunfire, gunshot, report, the act or sound of shooting a gun;
- shooting, shootout, a confrontation in which guns are fired;
- criticism, disapproval, flak, censure, bad press, opprobrium, the bad opinion of others

Etymology: 20C, pejorative or augmentative derivation from bos "gun"; attested almost immediately in the metaphorical senses. The noun bos "gun" (cf. Merch boss "gun") is borrowed from Willem Dutch (arm)bósz "gun", which descends via armbaust "crossbow" and synonymous Old French arbaleste from Latin arcuballista "crossbow".

152.5: False Friends

a complete arbitrary selection of dictionary entries from the Concise Onomatory o'Merch (fifth edition), a reference work published in 1961 and compiled by the Utcheter Lexical Association.

carjack [/ˈkaː.dʒak/ "breakup"] n. the ending of a romance, especially if unexpected or one-sided; v. intr. of a romance, to end; v. tr. to end a romance with (someone). The term once referred specifically to a letter informing one's partner of the end of your romance. Early 20C < Borlish soldiers' slang carjacq, car-Jacq meaning "dear John". During the Millstone Wars, this referred to a dreaded letter from one's beloved back home cancelling promises of marriage after the war.

danny [/ˈda.ni/ "nuisance"] n. an annoying person or thing, especially when obstructing what one wants to achieve; adj. annoying or obstructive. 10C Old English danneġ "stinging nettle" < Old Borlish danney, nanney (æq.), thought to reflect a Borland Kelt ?naindia "nettles" (cf Irish ńandóc).

eager [/ˈeː.gə/ "acid"] n. a sour or corrosive substance, (in alchemy) a substance which gives up mora [protons] in aqua or directly to another substance; adj. sour or corrosive, (in alchemy) giving up mora in aqua or directly to another substance, (by extension) unlikable or spiteful. Early Merch eagre "sour" < Middle French aigre (æq.) This descends from colloquial Latin ācrus "sour, bitter", variant of ācer in Classical Latin.

marksman [/ˈmaːks.mən/ "marquess"] n. the noble ruler of (originally) a borderland region known as a mark [march], traditionally ranking above earls due to the prestige of defending the realm's borders. 13C Early Merch < compound of Old English mearc "boundary" and mann "person" used to translate Old French marchis "marquess" in reference to the Marksman of Jerusalem. The term is primarily used for titleholders overseas; within Albion (possibly due to collision with "Markland") predominates the synonymous term edgelord.

153.2: prose "live"

prose /proˈze/ [pʁʊˈze]
- direct, straight, immediate, proceeding by the shortest possible route;
- unmediated, firsthand, primary, without any intermediary;
- live, in real time, having no delay between recording and broadcast

Etymology: either from Scholastic Latin prōseus "direct" or prōsē "directly", both derivatives of prō(r)sus "direct". This in turn appears to be from the prefix prō- "forward" and Old Latin vorsus "turned". In the last senses the term is attested from the 1920s.

153.3: çougr "wild"

çougr /tsugr̩/ [ˈtsu.gɐ]
- wild, untamed, not having been domesticated or trained for husbandry;
- uncontrolled, uninhibited, unrestrained, without limits on behaviour;
- misbehaving, unruly, acting out, disobedient, not doing as one is told;
- rude, tactless, without regard for etiquette

Etymology: 19C, imported from slang used on the Borlish-speaking islands of the Arcabil [Caribbean] but cognate with terms used across the whole region, including northern Cappatia [South America]. These originate in Run'allo [Quechua] chucru "difficult", as used to describe animals. The unrelated bougr "boor, scoundrel" may have influenced the word's sense development.

153.4: saget "arrowhead"

saget /saˈʒɛt/ [sɐˈʝɛt]
- arrowhead, the pointed part of an arrow or similar projectile;
- arrow, the pictorial representation of an arrow used to indicate direction;
- chevron, vee, a V shape;
- cursor, pointer, an icon indicating the current active position on a computer screen;
- one of the suits in the so-called "Maritime" card deck [1]

Etymology: Old Borlish saget "arrow", a semi-learned form reflecting Latin sagitta "arrow, shaft, bolt". The term was displaced in referring to the whole arrow by Germanic loan flesc "arrow". Metaphorical extensions are seen first in heraldic descriptions; the computing sense dates to the late twentieth century.

153.5: Maritime Cards

excerpt from Crossing the Rubicon: a Hidden History of Games, a 1982 work of popular history written (originally in Borlish as Y Rubicon Trasir: un Stoir Scos de Joy) by writer and stage performer Jonnovar Meyaunot. She became famous later in life as a humourist and sobot [radio] host of documentaries and quiz games.

…more common across the Northwestern Isles [Ireland, Britain, Borland], as well as Denmark and Willemy [~Lotharingia]; however, this particular style of deck actually originates in fifteenth-century Poland. The Maritime deck comprises fifty cards organised into five ensigns [suits] and three colours: these are gold, bucklers, staves, jewels and arrows (depicted below).

Many of the cards furthermore have conventional titles separate to their rank and ensign—for example, the deuce of staves is called the Duel, while the sept of jewels is known as the Stars. Over time the artwork on these cards has come to incorporate these thematic elements. In games where some cards trump the rest, the gold ensign typically takes this role, although some more modern games will use the aforementioned "named" cards in this way.

The use of a Maritime deck for divination mirrors many other sources of randomness, although the modern occult practices only date back to the early nineteenth century. They appear to have been popularised by Promethean clubs associated with the Deviance movement, and specifically the storied Winchester group.

Early records of the specific rules of card games using the Maritime deck are unfortunately thin on the ground. The first real description of a particular game appears in 1555 court records regarding the gambling debts of one Marc Levosclin…

154.2: paon ne Paçongr "incongruity"

paon ne Paçongr /paˈɔn ne paˈtsɔn.gr̩/ [ˈpaun ne pɐˈtsɔŋ.gɐ]
- something appearing in a unexpected or jarring context;
- incongruity, anomaly, aberration, a mismatch between expectation and reality

Etymology: idiom from the nineteenth century, literally meaning "a peacock on Paçongr (Place)". The noun paon "peacock" descends directly from synonymous pāvō in Latin. The placename Roðon Paçongr, a major intersection in Borland's capital city Damvath, is a borrowing from the Italian name Pazzongolo; this is presumed to reflect in part the uncommon diminutive -unculus in Latin, but the root is of unknown origin.

Jo horre sona luïr de paon ne Paçongr.

154.3: gajannar "win"

gajannar /ˌga.ʒaˈnar/ [ˌga.ʝɐˈnɐː]
- win, be awarded, to receive as a prize;
- earn, make, to receive as a wage;
- gain, take, get hold of, to succeed in obtaining;
- conquer, to acquire (territory) by force of arms;
- (dated, slang or poetic) tup, bed, swive, to have sex with

Etymology: presumably (along with noun gajan "victory, triumph") via Old French from a Frankish descendant of Classical German vaethanō "I hunt, pursue". However, the Borlish apparently reflects a Late Latin *vadianō "I win, earn" as opposed to the form *vadaniō which must be the etymon for e.g. Tuscan guadagnare "earn" and Norman wain "win". Attested in the last sense from as early as the fourteenth century.

Jo stima noc se sceus aðief gajannar.

154.4: mesmerist "straight shooter"

mesmerist /ˌmɛ.zmeˈrɪst/ [ˌmɛ.zmɪˈʀɪst]
- truth-teller, straight shooter, plain speaker, someone who is honest and forthright perhaps to the point of bluntness;
- clarifier, demystifier, someone who helps you understand things more clearly;
- realist, pragmatist, someone noted for seeing things as they really are without blinkers of expectation;
- whistleblower, leak, someone who reveals information that powerful parties wanted to keep secret

Etymology: 18th century borrowing from Scholastic Latin mesmerista "truth-teller" and mesmerizō "I reveal the truth"; this verb comes from synonymous μεσμερίζω • mesmerizō in Malchassian Greek, a derivative of μεσμέρι • mesméri "midday; (fig.) clarity, understanding".

Sy sour luïsc tojorn sona de mesmerist.

154.5: Northumber

Northumber (Borlish Norðumbr /nɔːˈðɪm.br̩/) is a polity on the east coast of Albion which borders Markland, Dunclothe and Scotland. Its largest cities are Yorwick (the capital) and Edinbrough.

History

Originally a pair of English kingdoms settled through the fifth and sixth centuries, Northumber was invaded and conquered from the late ninth century onwards by forces from Denmark and Horther. The city of Yorwick is even alleged to have practically given itself over to Dane rule, deposing the alderman and hoping to offer enough loot freely to the invaders so as to avoid the total destruction of the city.

Relations with neighbouring Markland were fraught until the tenth-century Elved Marriage between a Merch princess and the king of Northumber, which ended direct hostilities for nearly a century. Wars continued however with its other neighbours; for example, Northumber captured the city of Edinbrough (then called Eidin) from Dunclothe in 928, taking the last vestiges of Dunclothe's eastern coast.

By the end of the tenth century the territory of Northumber was united under Dane rule from Yorwick. With the waning of the Dane Supremacy the ability of Horther to project its rule overseas collapse; in Albion, Northumber became first among equals in a confederation of the local Dane kingdoms, including Dunclothe, Sodrick and Dublin. At this point Yorwick was by some way the richest city in Albion.

In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, Northumber became the northernmost vassal of the First Drengot Empire, which ruled over much of Albion and most of Gaul.

People

Wolfstan II (fl. c9), last English monarch of Northumber before it fell to Dane forces.

155.2: maugr "margin"

maugr /ˈmojr̩/ [ˈmo.ʝɐ]
- margin, the edge of a flat surface (especially of paper or another material written upon);
- fringe, verge, a decorated edge;
- edge, border, flank, brink, the area near the edge of anything;
- outskirts, the region surrounding a built-up area;
- sidelines, the outside of any activity

Etymology: via Old Borlish marȝr, mauȝr "margin, edge" from Latin margō "border, margin, edge". In the geographical sense originaly referring specifically to the rural areas near to the city of Damvath. The term is seen in the last metaphorical sense from the eighteenth century onward.

- armadillo, any of several burrowing mammals covered with bony protective plates;
- (colloquial) recluse, loner, hermit, wallflower, shrinking violet, a shy or retiring person whom it is hard to get to know

Etymology: from Vascon hivocin or Scholastic Latin hivocīnus, each having come via Morrove Arabic from a Mayattan language, plausibly Gish 'ibach "armadillo". In the metaphorical sense the word is attested from the early twentieth century, after the nickname of a character in popular children's book Figl a Fojon "Children of the Quarry".

155.4: marrenquon "nightmare"

marrenquon /ˌma.rɛnˈkwɔn/ [ˌma.ʀɪŋˈkwɔn]
- nightmare, bad dream, an unpleasant or frightening experience during sleep;
- incubus, a malevolent supernatural entity thought to cause nightmares;
- demon, bugbear, bogeyman, any menacing monster especially as used in stories to frighten children

Etymology: pleonastic compound of Old Borlish marr and enquon, both meaning "nightmare". The former is a loan either from Old French or from a German language, while the latter descends from Latin incubō "nightmare". The extension of this word to other malevolent demonic figures is seen from the sixteenth century.

excerpt from popular work of nonfiction Everywhere and Everything: the Third Millenium, published in April 2000 (originally in Leon as Jallondes y Jallisca: la Terça Milada) by Justino Silvera at the request of his publishers. The book purports to contain two thousand pieces of unusual or obscure trivia about the world; while most are accurate, the rushed research process led to several inaccuracies and a few flat-out lies finding their way into the book.

…threshold force mill [nuclear power plant] in the Groin [A Coruña].

Due to the region's janual religious history, the archbishop of Waduz [Vaduz, Liechtenstein] (which in laic terms is a minor city in Bavarn) is the only Christian official who can vote as a cardinal in the conclaves for electing both the Augsburgher and the Roman Popes. Fortunately, conclaves have never been called simultaneously for both Popes—nobody knows how the archbishop of Waduz would attend both conclaves in such a situation.

The tabre unit of heft, equal to one hundred (dime) ounces [~2.7kg, ~6lb] and first introduced in its modern form with the rest of the dime system in the 1820s, is named after Tabres' batman (Persian man tabréz), the principal commercial weight used in the Persian city of Tabres [Tabriz] and its surrounds. It is related to traditional units used across the Vetomund from Kiew [Kyiv] to Madray [Madurai], which vary widely from one-half a tabre to over thirty tabres.

156.1: A Parody of Literature

    excerpt in translation from the 1990 short story The Littlest Things We Know to be Small (originally in Vascon as Los Mens que Sems come Pochins) by Anna Rocamora. It parodied the overelaborate, overspecific style that had become popular in the regional highbrow literary scene in recent years and almost singlehandedly changed publishing trends overnight.

156.2: pengovin "pangolin"

pengovin /ˌpɛn.goˈvɪn/ [ˌpɛŋ.gʊˈvɪn]
- pangolin, any of several species of long-tailed and scaly mammals found in tropical Africa and Asia;
- a particular gambling card game, not dissimilar to bezique or pinochle, which originated in Bengal and became popular internationally during the nineteenth century

Etymology: borrowed into European languages (compare Merch penguin /pɪŋˈgjəwɪn/) in the seventeenth century from Bāsan [Malay] penguwing "pangolin", literally meaning "one who rolls". In the second sense, the word is a calque from Bengal bonoro "pangolin; bezique", apparently named for a deck which featured art of a pangolin on some of the cards.

Jamay so jo tal vencuð a pengovin.

156.3: vajot "perk"

vajot /vaˈʒɔt/ [vɐˈʝɔt]
- benefit, advantage, something in one's circumstances that is helpful;
- perk, bonus, any incidental benefit that one receives;
- (archaic) wage, profit, salary, money or other compensation received for work

Etymology: originally in the last senses, from a diminutive of Old Borlish uai "legal contract; salary, wage", from synonymous wadium in Medieval Latin (compare gage in Old French). This comes from Frankish wadi "stake, pledge", which is related to English "wedding". The word was displaced in its original sense by parsou "wage, rate; worth, value".

Y masctig trovar sta un vajot imprefait.

156.4: droccon "driveway"

droccon /drɔˈkɔn/ [dʀʊˈkɔn]
- lay-by, an indentation in the side of a road for vehicles to stop in;
- parking space, berth, an area where a vehicle is intended to be left;
- driveway, a private area at the front of a dwelling where one might keep one's vehicles

Etymology: twentieth century, a noun formation from verb droccar "notch, indent" calqued from dentelon "lay-by" in Parisian French. The verb comes from droc "notch, indentation", which is of obscure origin. Putative connections with English trough or Welsh rhych "furrow" have too many issues to be workable, and nobody credits a link with draucus "strongman" in Latin; perhaps the word (which is first attested in the Old Borlish period) is simply onomatopoeia.

156.5: Through the Ages

collected notes on a variety of background figures in Boralverse history, listed in chronological order.

Franco Cicala was the console of the maritime republic Jeans [Genoa] from 1119 until either 1122 or 1124 (records differ). The console being an elected position voted on by the local nobility, Franco would be followed intermittently by over a dozen consoli from among his descendants.

Andrew II was a martial-minded king of Markland in the early fourteenth century. He succeeded his uncle, who is remembered as being far more diplomatic. Andrew II oversaw the Sack of Rexam in 1301, an act which reignited the on-again off-again conflict between Markland and Wales known as the Mallor Wars. The original medieval building at St Brigid's Abbey was razed during this offensive.

Dewock Barclythe (1452-1539 N) was the Friar of Tremonnow and for several decades the prime Factor of Records at the Brethin House there. Records of his correspondence with clergy and academics across western Europe have survived to the present day. These include some of the earliest attestations of dart [vector] geometry, and thus the beginnings of the unification of geometry and computation.

Lord Simon, the sixth Baron Monçating (b. 1770) was an intellectual, a notorious libertine of the Damvath melee, and an early proponent of Deviance Theology in Borland. He was of Warnine [Guaraní] descent through his mother. His family had been notorious for decades due to a protracted legal battle between his father and second cousin over the Barony of Haubrath. By the age of eighteen Simon could speak Latin, Dutch (and according to his defamers, Warnine), and he could play the clavier and the torriot [a bassoon-like wind instrument].

Marcio Dourao was an author and rabblerouser best remembered for his work Galatheus, or the Knowledge of Good and Evil. This collection of short stories pastiching Greek mythology was written in 1930 during the decade-long Portingale Anarchy. The title references the story of Galatea and Pygmalion. Galatheus was banned in neighbouring Vascony and Morrack for its background politics and, unofficially, for its throughline of gender exploration; neither polity had quite forgotten their roles in the traditionally-minded Modest Arrangement of the previous century.

157.2: libar "quaff"

libar /liˈbar/ [lɪˈbɐː]
- sip, nurse, to drink slowly;
- quaff, imbibe, swig, to drink a mouthful of;
- absorb, take up, suck up, (of a substance or object) to take in (a fluid);
- take in, contemplate, appreciate, to consider or to enjoy experiencing;
- (uncommon, religion) to offer a libation, to pour out a liquid as a sacrifice to a deity

Etymology: borrowed from Latin lībō "I taste, sip; I offer a libation". Extension to metaphorical drinking is attested from the eighteenth century. In the last sense, a backformation or reborrowing from Latin which is much less common than the synonymous phrase libaçon fair "to offer a libation".

Y haprman libau sy bier e reuloy a racont fair.
/i ˌhapr̩ˈman liˈbo si bjɛr e rauˈlɔi a raˈkɔnt fer/

157.3: lox "pizza"

lox /lɔks/ [lɔks]
- pizza, tostada, manakish, lahmacun, lángos, tlayuda, uttapam, okonomiyaki, pajeon, any meal that comprises a thin bread or pancake base with various savoury toppings that is eaten in slices

Etymology: borrowed into Borlish in the twentieth century via for instance Saxon lox, Napolitan losse, Awrish [Hungarian] locs /lokʃ/ and Greek λώξη • lṓxē "pizza, etc." from a metathetic variant of Armeniac լաւշկի • lōški "lavash, pitta, small flatbread". The word is applied widely, although without modification it refers prototypically to slices of thin bread with a sauce, cheese and vegetables.

Nos accataum trenc a lox dy stal ant un canougf a fais blau.
/nɔz ˌa.kaˈtom trɛnk a lɔks di stal ant ɪn kaˈnuif a fez blo/

157.4: harif "weird"

harif /haˈrɪf/ [hɐˈʀɪf]
- weird, eldritch, uncanny, off, unsettling in a mysterious way;
- unexpected, surprising, unusual, not having been anticipated;
- grotesque, distorted, misshapen, having a wrong or abnormal form;
- (in parachthon works) fey, supernatural, ethereal, mystical, belonging to beings or powers that are not of this world

Etymology: borrowed in the late Middle Borlish period from Vascon harif (cf. Leon or Portingale harivo) "misshapen, grotesque; weird, uncanny". This in turn comes from Arabic خَرِب • kharib "ruined, destroyed". The term gained its conventionalised usage in speculative fiction in the late nineteenth century, popularised by the works of Nan.

Jo parceveu my cigl er se portant cos harif.
/ʒo ˌpar.tseˈvau mi tsail ɛr se pɔrˈtant kɔz haˈrɪf/

157.5: Painkiller Philology

notes on the chemistry and linguistics of the painkiller cozebdo-diamaschal benjamine [ibuprofen].

Cozebdo-diamaschal benjamine (as a medicine sold under several names, including "CD" or "Tommy pills") is a hebetant [painkilling] substance developed in the early twentieth century. It was the result of collaboration between the Branwen Sanatory in New Leudong [south-eastern Australia] and the University of Rimack [Lima] in Tavancy [descendant state of the Incan Empire], which sought to develop hebetants with faster action and milder adversions [side effects]. It was first synthesised in 1932, and a decade later it had surpassed salix derivatives [e.g. aspirin] in sales worldwide, due to providing better pain relief (as opposed to merely reducing the symptoms of fever).

Name

The name of this substance comprises three parts.

The core of the substance is a benjamine [benzene] ring; the name "benjamine" is borrowed via Scholastic Latin and Vascon from Arabic لُبَان جَاوِيّ‎ • lubān jāwiyy, literally "Jawan [Javanese] frankincense", corrupted at some point by the name Benjamin.

The first of the extensions in this substance is a cozebdone branch [isobutyl]. Cozebdone spirit [isobutane] is a rearrangement of the linear zebdone spirit [butane], a colourless and flammable air with a spine of four coke [carbon] atoms. The root zebdo- "four colk atoms" derives from Cairene Arabic زبدة • zébda "butter", first used when zebdone acid [butyric acid] was isolated from milk fat.

The second of the extensions is located directly opposite the first, as indicated by the prefix dia- "across, over", from Greek. It consists of a maschale [propionic acid] branch, which is the acid oil with a spine of length three, a malodorous clear liquid. The substance was named in 1850 after the Ancient Greek μᾰσχᾰ́λη • maschálē "armpit", since it was isolated from human sweat excreted by skin zoia [microorganisms].

158.1: Medieval Provence

notes in translation on the territory of Provence in the medieval period.

Medieval Provence was a vassal of various greater powers for almost a millennium.

158.2: affr "fright"

affr /ˈafr̩/ [ˈa.fɐ]
- fright, alarm, shock, terror, a sudden and violent feeling of fear;
- threat, nightmare, ordeal, a scary experience;
- monster, menace, something or someone who is scary;

Etymology: borrowed into Middle Borlish from French affre "horror, terror". This descends via Old Vascon affre from a Gothic root reflecting Classical German æbras "bitter, violent". The term has been used also for the emotion's cause since the eighteenth century.

Un min d'affr sclarisceu sur y justicer.

158.3: ciscr "squeal"

ciscr /tsɪxr̩/ [ˈtsɪ.xɐ]
- squeal, screech, shriek, a strident high-pitched sound as may be caused by friction;
- a loud, high-pitched animal cry;
- scream, yelp, a high-pitched vocalisaton due to fright or surprise

Etymology: attested in Old Borlish ciscle "shriek", a deverbal from cisclar "to shriek, scream" (now obsoleted by ciscr fair "to do a shriek"). This descends from a synonymous cistulō in Vulgar Latin reflected also in Vascon chillar "creak" and Parisian gicler "spurt". In turn this is presumed to be an alteration of Classical Latin fistulō "I whistle, play the flute" via assimilation or sound symbolism.

Y belem ny forest se mis afaç con ec ciscr d'aucel.

158.4: slengettar "snog"

slengettar /ˌslɛn.gɛˈtar/ [ˌzlɛŋ.gɪˈtɐː]
- snog, pash, make out, French kiss, to kiss passionately (especially with tongue);
- mangle, botch, fumble, to do something sloppily;
- overegg, splurge, slather, to do something overenthusiastically;
- meddle, pry, butt in, overstep, badger, to be overly familiar or intrusive into personal or private matters

Etymology: originally in the first senses, attested along with the related noun slenget "snog, make-out session" in the late eighteenth century. It applies the somewhat pejorative verbal derivation s- -ar and the diminutive suffix -et to the root lenc "tongue" < Latin lingua "tongue". The first metaphorical extensions are each attested from the early twentieth century; in the sense of "meddle" it is an innovation of the last couple of decades.

158.5: Roun

Roun (Norman, Kentish /ʀãw̃/) is a port on the Seine river and the capital city of Kent.
History

Founded by the Gauls, the city was known to the Romans as Rotomagus and it became the seat of the local bishopric in the early medieval period. The ninth century saw the incursion of the Normans into the region as part of the wider Dane Supremacy; by 850 Roun was under their control. By the eleventh century Roun had become the seat of the Drengot family, ruling the Duchy of Normandy as a semi-autonomous vassal of the Kingdom of the Franks (the western fragment of the erstwhile Francian Empire).

After the Kernovan Conjuring and the formation of the First Drengot Empire covering much of Albion [Great Britain] and most of Gaul [France], Roun was sidelined. The Drengot Emperors moved their court to Paris, although they continued to personally own the duchies of Normandy and Kent. This period marks the beginning of the persistent political union of these two regions on either side of the English Channel.

One of the successor states to the First Drengot Empire was this united Norman Kent, ruled from Roun. King Vincent II of Kent, who ruled in the mid-fifteenth century, is remembered for the expansion of the city keep and for his twin sons (the "Two Henries") who ruled jointly after his death. During this period Roun French developed fully as one standard written form of the language (as opposed to Parisian or Burgund French).

Roun was the administrative centre of the Drengot Collusion from the nineteenth century until its collapse in 1961. The city housed the "Red House", the headquarters of Collusion's Ministry for Information.

Authors
    Mark Deuthex (fl. 1973), whose spycraft tale We Wake to Broken Windows draws on his own experiences in the Red House.
    Josephene Foilliers (fl. 1913), writer of the first work of fiction to sell over a million copies in a single year.
    Ashford Pasquier (fl. 1968), inventor of the term "pistol mesh" in his parachthon work Starsail.

159.2: occajonal "opportune"

occajonal /ɔˌka.ʒoˈnal/ [ʊˈka.ʝʊˈnal]
- well-timed, timely, seasonable, opportune, taking place at the correct moment;
- expedient, adventitious, convenient, happening more generally in a helpful manner;
- occasional, intermittent, on and off, occurring at many well-separated times;
- sporadic, ad hoc, catch-as-catch-can, only whenever the opportunity presents itself (indicating a lack of forethought or predictability)

Etymology: adjectival derivation from occajon "opportunity, the right moment", which is a Middle Borlish borrowing from synonymous occāsiō in Latin. The word's semantic extension is in line with similar shifts in cognates across the Romance languages.

Caye un homily magn occajonal sur cartað.

159.3: groun "teen"

groun /grun/ [gʀun]
- a member of a countercultural and rowdy youth movement in the latter days of the Drengot Collusion;
- (colloquial) teen, teenager, adolescent, youth, a young person in the years around the age of majority;
- rascal, hooligan, brat, scamp, rebel, an rowdy and usually immature person;
- roughcut, sketch, work-in-progress, stub, an incomplete item or piece of work;
- beta, mock-up, prototype, an early version of something

Etymology: borrowed with the first sense in the mid-twentieth century from Willem Dutch gróng "adolescence; unruly young person", cognate with growing in English. Applied to all youths of a similar age since the 1970s, the word quickly also became a mild insult describing stereotypical teen behaviours. In the final senses it is only attested in the last twenty years.

Jo passau un ðorof de groun jos l'odysse.

159.4: abrevar "water"

abrevar /ˌa.breˈvar/ [ˌa.bʀɪˈvɐː]
- water, irrigate, to pour water over in order to help grow;
- wet, soak, drench, moisten, to cause to be wet;
- slake, quench, to satisfy the thirst of;
- to supply with (usually alcoholic) drinks;
- schmooze, butter up, chat up, to curry favour with

Etymology: from Old Borlish abrevar "to water", likely borrowed from Old French synonymous abrever in Old French. This is a metathetic variant of abevrer, which descends from Vulgar Latin abbiberō "I water" (which the Old Borlish may alternatively reflect directly), a derivative of Classical bibō "I drink". The word's association with alcohol and social gatherings shows influence from slang term abrevað "tipsy, squiffy, somewhat drunk", literally "watered".

159.5: Cambrick Codices

summaries of two twentieth-century works of writing which were originally written in one or another standard of the Welsh language.

Children of the Battle of Rexam [Wrexham, 1] is a sensation trevold [hit novel] written by Jon Paldreth and published in 1931. It is a fictionalised account of the orphaned children of the Duke of Chester in the decades following his death at the 1483 Battle of Rexam. By Paldreth's account, the children met practically every famous personage in contemporary western Europe, from General daus Sanz to King Andrew of Markland (in fairness, the eldest child was indeed briefly a hostage of the then-prince Andrew). Moreover, Paldreth contrives to have the children present at almost every significant historical event of the time; unlikely as this all is, the book has enjoyed much use in school history lessons as an approachable introduction to the politics of the time.

---

The Grimmer Hall [2] is a scholastic reference quire about developments in early methodics [programming]. It was published in 1999 and written by New Leudong methodist Cai Sonquo during his tenure at the University of Mehannin [Brisbane]. The work covers the use of algorithms from antiquity (for example Euclid's method for finding coarsest division), through the early modern period (e.g. the waveform display [Fourier transform] and its application to astronomy), and into the titular "grimmer halls" (rooms of many people—usually women—performing calculations longhand) of the early twentieth century. The work ends its account just before the invention of the entirely mechanical general-purpose grimmer [computer].

160.2: camul "jeep"

- jeep, off-roader, SUV, a small military-style vehicle suited to rough terrain;
- (attributive) rugged, weatherproofed, hardened, fortified, treated or designed so as to resist the elements

Etymology: mid-twentieth century, genericised from Drengot military jargon but of uncertain further origin. Possibly an alteration of camel "camel" in reference to transporting soldiers and materiel; perhaps based on Latin chamūlcus "a kind of chariot". The term has been used to describe other "battle-ready" gear (usually consumer goods like backpacks and drinks bottles) since the 1980s.

160.3: magrastr "scrawny"

magrastr /mɛiˈrastr̩/ [mɪjˈʀa.stɐ]
- scrawny, lean, gangly, lanky, weedy, being notably unmuscular;
- malnourished, gaunt, underweight, unheathily thin as from illness or hunger;
- flimsy, spindly, rickety, not held together securely and liable to break or fall apart;
- unsound, tenuous, sketchy, (of an idea) not convincing due to a lack of solid argumentation

Etymology: early Modern formation using the pejorative suffix -astr < Latin -aster "incomplete resemblance to" from adjective magr "limited, scarce, meagre". This descends directly via Old Borlish maȝre /ˈmaɣ.rə/ from Latin macer "lean, skinny". The word is attested in metaphorical use from the nineteenth century.

mot /mɔt/ [mɔt]
- wad, lump, clod, an amorphous compact mass;
- plug, blockage, obstruction, jam, something that blocks a passage;
- issue, problem, bug, anything that holds up a process

Etymology: from Old Borlish mot "lump, mound" and thought to be of Germanic origin; possibly via Old French mote "hillock" from Frankish motta "mud, peat, turf". The term is first used in the "blockage" sense in the fifteenth century, and soon thereafter it sees metaphorical use.

160.5: Diversions and Dilettantes

notes on various features and historical figures beginning with a common pair of letters.

Diana Theodora Queiroz (fl. 1810) was a writer and polemicist from Vascony who was primarily active during the Long Peace period. She was a major figure in opposition to Deviance theology and an ally of the Modest Arrangement, hewing especially closely to the latter's emphasis on morality and familial obligation. Her views have seen her cast as a precursor to the Blue Marian movement, which sought to advance the status of women within a highly religious and stratified framework.

A dice is a value or score of ten in a game or sport. For example, the Maritime deck contains cards like "the dice of staves" or "the dice of gold", and the chances of getting a dice when rolling a pair of dice are one in twelve. This term, along with its cohort [1], were borrowed into the English languages from the Norman names for numerals during the First Drengot Empire in the early second millennium. In certain sports, including lineball, the most points one can score at once is ten; because of this, the word "dice" appears in some idioms meaning "sudden good fortune" or "an impressive feat".

Dimus [Phobos] is the larger of the two moons of Mars. It was discovered, along with the smaller moon Phobus [Deimos], in 1869 by Mashick astronomer Coscatl bint Inám; she also discovered the eighth planet of Janus [Neptune]. Following the custom set by the four great jovial moons, she named the pair after the twin sons of Mars, who personify dread and panic respectively.

Dion Becolla (fl. 1968) was a Borlish author who grew up in the industrial city of Neuvort. She wrote several trevolds [novels] during the 1960s which capitalised on the so-called General Italian Fervour of the period. Her most famous work is the period piece Waging World Peace [2], set during the 1880s in the midst of the Good Game period and owing much to the masquira genre and its hidden identities, high society and complicated schemes.

161.1: Many Happy Returns

161.2: sbayour "bystander"

sbayour /sbɛˈjur/ [zbɪˈʝʊː]
- bystander, onlooker, witness, spectator, rubbernecker, a person present at but not involved in some event;
- voyeur, peeping Tom, someone viewing a scene from hiding for their own  (often erotic) pleasure;
- gossip, busybody, quidnunc, nosy parker, somebody considered to have an inappropriate interest in others' affairs

Etymology: first seen with the later senses in the nineteenth century, agentive derivation from sbayar "gawp, goggle". This reflects Medieval Latin exbadō "I gape", from early slang verb badō "I yawn". Originally the term was exclusive negative or insulting; by the early twentieth century more neutral usage begins to be attested.

Toð gent saun ig cay ty morrig un sbayour jaçol.

161.3: senglottaç "whine"

senglottaç /ˌsɛn.glɔˈtats/ [ˌsɛŋ.glʊˈtats]
- whine, whinge, moan, a noise of complaint or pain;
- gripe, grievance, cavil, a petty or trivial objection or criticism;
- any long, drawn-out, high-pitched sound (especially one which is annoying)

Etymology: nineteenth century derivative from senglot or the related verb senglottar "sob, sigh, lament". These descend from Vulgar Latin singluttus "sob, hiccup", a alteration of synoynmous singultus in Classical Latin under the influence of gluttiō "I swallow, gulp". Metaphorical use is attested from the early twentieth century.

L'er resoluð a casc senglottaç ignorar.

161.4: avoccaçon "fun"

avoccaçon /ˌa.vɔ.kaˈtsɔn/ [ˌa.vʊ.kɐˈtsɔn]
- leisure, diversion, recreation, time off from work doing activities for their own sake;
- fun, entertainment, amusement, activity designed to give pleasure or relaxation to their audience or participants;

Etymology: nominal derivation from avoccar "divert, amuse, entertain" or directly from Latin āvocātiō "distraction", both originally from Latin āvocō "I call away, distract, dissuade". The meaning was influenced by contrast to its traditional counterpart voccaçon "career, occupation".

Sceye all'oç asc pog avoccaçon a phasm.

161.5: Dunclothe

Dunclothe (Merch /ˈdʊŋ.kluːð/, Welsh Dincluth /dɪŋˈklyːθ/) is a political and cultural region of western Albion, located south of Scotland and north of Markland. From the Clothe river valley it extends down along the coast to the Bay of Morcambe.

Toponomy

Dunclothe takes its name from the early medieval petty kingdom known alternately as Alt Clud, Strad Clud, or Din Clud; these are ancient British or Guile phrases meaning "cliff, valley or fort of the river Clothe". It is uncertain whether the Dun- element seen in English names for the region reflects Old Irish dún "fort" or Old English dún "hill".

History

The British territory of Dunclothe was partially conquered settled by Dane invaders during the ninth century. However, the region was not subsumed into the Dane Supremacy as fully as neighbouring Sodrick and Northumber to the west and east respectively.

Dunclothe appears to have controlled the fort at Eidin (modern Edinbrough) until it was sacked by Northumber in 928. Meanwhile Sodrick's power was waning; under King Roderick, Dunclothe conquered the isles of Arran and Mann by 942. The bride of King Radulf of Northumber (r. 951–), one Atre of Cheswic, may perhaps be one of King Roderick's daughters.

In the early eleventh century, Dunclothe is part of a confederation of Dane Kingdoms. However, this would shortly collapse with the rapid expansion of the First Drengot Empire to the south, which incorporated Northumber along with most of southern Albion. This period sees Dunclothe grow closer to newly-united Wales, allies in opposition to Drengot power.

In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, Dunclothe-led fisheries in the North Atlantic were a major exporter of dried and/or cured cod, selling it via the meshes of Borland and Vascony as far afield as the Eastern Middlesea. This trade was a notable source of specie for the vicinity.

The Kingdom of Britain was founded in the fifteenth century, formalising the suzerainty of Wales over the tallaths of Devon and Dunclothe.

162.2: glouç "giggle"

glouç /gluts/ [gluts]
- cluck, gobble, the sound made by poultry;
- giggle, snicker, titter, a high-pitched and silly sort of laugh;
- (interj.) pah, pshaw, faugh, a noise of derision or incredulity

Etymology: Middle Borlish deverbal from now-obsolete gloçar "cluck; chuckle" (now usually glouç fair "to do giggles"). This reflects Vulgar Latin glōciāre "to cluck", a regularised conjugation class variant of synonymous glōcīre in Classical Latin. As an interjection the word is attested from the eighteenth century and is now somewhat old-fashioned or facetious.

162.3: ðesmbal "bombshell"

ðesmbal /ðɛzm̩ˈbal/ [ˌðɛ.zɐmˈbal]
- a sport with similarities to dodgeball in which players aim to throw a ball so it hits their opponents;
- dodgeball, the ball used in this sport;
- surprise, bombshell, bolt from the blue, an unexpected event or arrival that is felt to come out of nowhere;
- inspiration, flash of insight, a sudden realisation or deduction

Etymology: verb-noun compound formed in the twentieth century by analogy to earlier analogous words like caugtrbal "football", lit. "kick-ball". The noun bal "ball" comes from a variety of Germanic sources and potentially via Medieval Latin—cf. Old English beall, Old Norse bòllr, Frankish bal "ball". The verb ðesmar "aim, target, direct" reflects Old Borlish ðestmar "work out, consider, turn one's attention to", which descends from an extension of Classical Latin æstimō "I determine the worth of, I value"; thus, ðesmar is a doublet of semi-learned stimar "consider, deem". The word has been used metaphorically for unexpected things since the 1990s.

162.4: frottar "strum"

frottar /frɔˈtar/ [fʀʊˈtɐː]
- rub, chafe, scour, scrub, scrap, to move one object over another with pressure and friction;
- tickle, to touch (a person) in a manner so as to cause laughter;
- strum, to draw the fingers or a plectrum over the strings of a musical instrument;
- pluck, pick, press, to sound the individual strings or keys of an instrument;
- play, to make sounds with a guitar/harp/keyboard instrument

Etymology: from Old Borlish, borrowed from (or possibly the source of) Old French frotter "rub, polish". This is in either case of uncertain origin, but is generally thought to reflect Latin participle frictus of fricō "I rub, chafe". Musical senses are attested from the Middle Borlish period.

162.5: Mathematical Etymology (cont.)

more excerpts from the Veriloquace Glossary o'Mathematics, a reference quire in the Merch language compiled by Rotcham [Rochdale] University Primers.

æther /ˈiː.θə/ [field] the assignment of a quantity (e.g. a dart [vector]) to each point in space. In the modern sense from the late 19C, formerly used to refer to the supposed medium within which phenomena like light, heat or astraphor [electricity] propagate. Early Merch ether (later re-classicised) < Old French < Latin æthēr "the heavens" < Greek αἰθήρ • aithḗr "heavens, open sky".

hedre /ˈhɛ.də/ [face; bivector] one of the mozate [2D] components of the surface of a solid figure; a physical quantity of mozate kind, such as rotation. 16C, extracted from compounds like octahedre < Scholastic Latin -hedrum "-faced" < Greek ἕδρᾱ • hédrā "seat, chair; face".

matching /ˈma.tʃɪŋg/ [bijection] a reversible correspondence between the elements of two collections W and X, both severing [injective] and covering [surjective], so that each element of X is associated to a unique element of W and vice versa. 1831 < translation of Saxon jochung "yoking" in Dümmeyer, 1827. The verb match comes from the identical noun < Old English mæċċa "consort" < Classical German macciō "partner".

oversamn /ˈoː.sa.mn̩/ [superset] a collection X which contains all of the elements of another collection W, and usually more besides. 1831 < calque of Saxon övrsammel "superset" in Dümmeyer, 1827. The noun samn "set" is from the identical verb < Old English samnian "collect, gather" < Classical German samnō "I gather".

stepth /ˈstɛpθ/ [gradient] the ratio of a change in vertical displacement to the corresponding change in horizontal displacement, a measure of how sloped an incline is. 1690 in mathematics < early Merch steapth < adjective steap "steep, sheer" < Old English stēap "high, lofty" < Classical German staupas "high, lofty".

vater /ˈvɛː.tə/ [sine] the ratio of the lengths of the side of a triangle opposite a given angle to the length of the hypotenuse. 17C < Scholastic Latin vatrus (cf. earlier alvatrō etc) < Arabic وَتَر • watar “bowstring, chord” < calque of Sanscrit ज्या jiā "bowstring; vater". The polysemy arises by picturing an arc of a circle with the chord drawn as a bow with bowstring.

163.1: This Side of Aldebaran

excerpt in translation from 1987 book This Side of Aldebaran [1], the official print adaptation of the 1986 film of the same name. The story is a touchstone of the contemporary voidtale genre, despite lacking the xenic [alien] peoples so common to the genre.

163.2: flasq "pathetic"

flasq /flask/ [flask]
- limp, sagging, flaccid, flabby, flimsy, loose, not taut or otherwise lacking stiffness;
- unenthusiastic, half-hearted, dispassionate, tepid, lacking interest or passion;
- pathetic, pitiful, hapless, inspiring scorn or compassion due to inadequacy or ineptitude

Etymology: borrowed in the Middle Borlish period from early Norman flasque "soft, malleable". This appears to be a hypercorrected variant of earlier flaque, descending from Latin flaccus "flabby, sagging". The unetymological /s/ would reflect analogy from other words whose coda /s/ had been lost in Parisian French. The term has been applied to emotion since the seventeenth century, and to people since the nineteenth.

Jo scavau un grinment flasq dy melodram.

163.3: cedar "guitar"

cedar /tseˈdar/ [tsɪˈdɐː]

- zither, gittern, any of several similar such instruments in the lute family;
- (informal) skate, ray, any flat-bodied fish with wing-like fins and a whip-like tail

Etymology: Middle Borlish, borrowed from early Jean cedara "guitar", a descendant of Latin cithara "lyre, lute" which was repurposed to refer to a related instrument of Morrove descent imported via Spain. The term has been used in the last sense since the nineteenth century (cf earlier ray a cedar "guitar ray") in reference to the shape of these fish.

163.4: gapir "pop up"

gapir /gaˈpɪr/ [gɐˈpɪː]
- happen intermittently, to occur at unpredictable intervals;
- pop up, crop up, to appear (multiple times) without warning;
- be flaky, shilly-shally, to behave unpredictably or unreliably

Etymology: verbal derivative from gap "patch", apparently borrowed in the Middle Borlish period from Welsh gap "hole; patch, a distinct section of some larger whole". This in turn was taken from Old Norse gap "empty space, gap, chasm", deverbal from gapa "to gape, be open wide".

L'oç astuçour es gapiscent par toð y lasc.

163.5: Like Oil and Water

collected notes on two unrelated topics.

Psolic aphlox (Merch /ˈsɔ.lɪk ˈa.flɔks/) [carbon monoxide] is a colourless, odourless and toxic air formed by burning organic material without enough ignifex [oxygen].

Though the noxious effects of breathing the air in closed spaces where a coal fire is burning have been known since antiquity (and likely since prehistory), truly theoretical investigation did not begin until the seventeenth century, and the air was not isolated from the acid oil palacy [oxalic acid] until the Long Peace period at the turn of the nineteenth century. Its modern name, first used in 1854, comprises the adjective psolic [deoxygenated, with a lower oxidation number] from Greek ψόλος • psólos "soot, smoke" and the noun aphlox [carbon dioxide] from Greek ᾰ̓φλόξ  • ăphlóx "without flame".

---

The Graven Sea (Merch /ˈgɾɛː.vən ˈseː/) [Baltic Sea], formerly or poetically also the Eastmere, is an arm of the Atlantic Ocean in northern Europe east of Denmark and enclosed by several polities.

The name derives from Scholastic Latin Gravinia, a term for the region around this sea. This is a backformation from gravinicus, graunicus "from or pertaining to the Graven Sea". In turn, this appears to have been a minim error by a late medieval scribe from former granvicus, a borrowing from Old Norse Gandvik. This placename, identified with the Graven Sea since the fourteenth century, may have originally referred to any of several bodies of water, including the Arctic Ocean.

The archaic synonym Eastmere is a calque from the name in various German languages; for instance, in Frise [Frisian] the sea is called the Astmar "east sea".

The work A Baptism of Fire: Christianity and the Graven was written by Agata Naziunas and published in 1988 by Leidéiai Givatés. This work chronicles the history of the Christianisation of the states and peoples on the Graven Sea's coasts, with a particular focus on Naziunas's homeland of Lithow [Lithuania].

164.2: cardonar "unknot"

cardonar /ˌkar.doˈnar/ [ˌkɐː.dʊˈnɐː]
- card, tease, to separate and align the fibres of wool, etc;
- comb, curry, to run a carding tool through fur or hair;
- disentangle, unknot, to unfasten a knotted string or to separate several entwined strings;
- sort through, organise, to go over a collection of things and separate them into groups;
- resolve, sort out, simplify, clarify, streamline, to make a situation less complex

Etymology: verbal derivative from Old Borlish cart "carding tool" (since obsoleted by cardon, a synonymous variant). This is a descendant of Latin carduus or cardō "wild thistle". The verb has been used for metaphorical disentangling since at least the fourteenth century.

stig /stai/ [stai]
- stitch, a stabbing pain in the side caused by exercise or laughter;
- ache, pain, spasm, paroxysm, any similar sensation of pain;
- pang, throe, a sudden outburst of a negative emotion

Etymology: from Old Borlish stii, stiȝ "stitch, stabbing pain", a borrowing from synonymous stiġe in Borland Old English. This is a variant of stiċe "stitch", which descends from Classical German sticis "prick, poke, a sticking". For more general pains the word is attested since the sixteenth century, and for emotions it is seen soon afterward.

- in view, visible, within sight as from a lookout;
- nearby, close, within reach, accessible, not particularly far away;
- approaching, oncoming, imminent, heading towards one or about to occur (especially of something negative)

Etymology: originally in the first sense, used as an exclamation to attract attention or hail another ship. The extended uses are seen from the nineteenth century, initially restricted to colloquial or humorous contexts.

164.5: Kelt Borland

notes on the people and culture of Borland before the Roman invasion.

The Iron Age began on Borland at approximately the same time as on the other Northwestern Isles [Ireland, GB] in the ninth century aN. The identity of the first Borland ironworkers is debated and is made complicated by overlapping waves of migrations, but eventually they became identifiably Kelt. The last significant such wave was of early Brythonic speakers on Albion settling Borland from the west in the fourth century aN, the ancestors of the small hill-fort kingdoms which covered the island at the time of the Roman invasion in the first century N.

There are several archaelogical structures on Borland which predate the Kelt migrations but which the Kelts repurposed for ritual use. The most famous of these sites is a so-called "labyrinth" located on Çadrosc Heath in the northwest of the island. There are also many cairns dating to this period, now called sarzin stones (from a late medieval use of sarzin "pagan" deriving from Latin Saracēnus "Muslim").

The name Borland (Istr Boral) is thought to descend from the Kelt enis borag "island of the dawn [viz. East]" and bora ale "the other Easterners", which would imply the name was originally as exonym used by Brythonic speakers on Albion. The adoption of this name for the island by the Romans was undoubtedly influenced by its similarity to unrelated Latin boreālis "northern"; this connection is referenced by contemporary writers.

The Borland tradition of Revillon can trace its origins to a winter feast celebrated by the Kelts, recorded as the Flidōlus (further etymology unknown) by third-century Roman historian Ammian.

groinar /grɔiˈnar/ [gʀʊiˈnɐː]
- oink, grunt, snort, to make the sound of e.g. a pig;
- growl, snarl, (of an animal) to make a deep rumbling sound;
- grumble, scoff, (of a person) to make a similar such sound to indicate disapproval or scorn

Etymology: from Old Borlish groȝnar, groȝndir "grunt", reflecting Vulgar variants of Classical Latin grunniō "I grunt". To describe sounds made by people the word is attested as early as the Old Borlish period. The expected modern spelling grognar was once sporadically used but may have been avoided on aesthetic grounds (compare genoil "knee" < genoȝl in Old Borlish).

165.3: sax "asteroid"

sax /saks/ [saks]
- asteroid, planetoid, comet, a naturally occurring solid object orbiting the Sun which is too small to become spherical under gravity;
- (specifically) such a small body located with the cisjovial ring [asteroid belt]

Etymology: 1813, a borrowing from Latin saxum "stone, rock", used as a calque from synonymous tsa'ra in Mashick Arabic. The term was originally used to describe the various apparently-pointlike bodies in the cisjovial ring, which at that time were being discovered by telescope. The first celestial body this word was applied to, Ixion [Ceres], is now known to be spherical under gravity and so is no longer considered to be a sax. In modern usage saxes include comets, although knowledge of comets dates back to antiquity.

165.4: or bon "alright"

or bon /ɔr bɔn/ [ʊːˈbɔn]
- alright, OK, cool, sure, an interjection indicating acknowledgement or acceptance;
- so, anyway, look, see, hey, an interjection used after a pause to introduce a new topic

Etymology: phrase comprising or "well, however" and bon "good, correct". The particle or (now archaic in isolation) descends from Old Borlish or "now", either straight from Latin (hāc) hōrā "in (this) hour" or via synonymous (a)ore in Old French. The adjective bon comes directly from Latin bonus "good, right".

Or bon, tenau a le javigar.

165.5: The 1910s

collected notes on various happenings in the decade 1910 to 1919.

Loðaç Berxon (b. 1865) led the Borland chapters of the Outland Arcabil Association from 1913 until 1918. Berxon had emigrated to the capital city of Damvath from her birthplace in the Arcabil [Caribbean] a decade earlier, due to the disruption of the Millstone War. She was an established author, best known for her first work L'Askouð Pyrrhaz (The Firekeeper's Stronghold), published in 1910. The Outland Arcabil Association was a collection of societies working for the benefit of the Arcabil diaspora across the globe.

The first then-called "house of odyssey" [cinema] to sell tickets to the public on a regular basis was established in Boxa [Novi Sad, Serbia] in 1912. One of the venue's first great successes was a recording of a ballet concert accompanied by the St Hurroco Youth Orchestra of Furlain [Friuli].

Un Seir Deura Soffire (One Evening Will Have to be Enough) was a 1913 work in the masquira genre by Roun author Josephene Foilliers. Its riproaring execution of the classic masquira plot structure of schemes and opulence galore made it an instant success across the Drengot Collusion and beyond; this work was the first book to sell more thna a million copies in its first year.

The literary genre of social comedy has its origins in the late 1910s, with authors like Dorotha Quistack and Judeta Barracin adapting elements of prior genres like lovetales and adolescences. Social comedy is characterised by plots with low stakes, an emphasis on personal friendships and enmities, and generally either rural or low-class urban settings.

166.1: The Ceres Gambit

excerpt in translation from 1952 spycraft trevold The Ceres Gambit (originally published in Borlish as Vellisqment: Ixion), written by Joron Aldaxinte. She was born in the industrial Borlish town of Neuvort, the daughter of a clerk and a minor functionary in the local government.

166.2: fren "brake"

fren /frɛn/ [fʀɛn]
- bit, piece of metal placed in a horse's mouth and connected to the reins;
- brake, device used to slow or stop a vehicle usually via friction;
- deceleration, slowdown, reduction in speed;
- ritenuto, ritardando, (in music) reduction of tempo;
- restraint, reserve, tendency to act with caution or prudence

Etymology: originally in the first sense, via Old Borlish directly from Latin frēnum "bridle, harness, curb, bit". The word was extended metaphorically some centuries before it was reapplied to physical devices on other vehicles. In music the word is calqued from Willem Dutch afrem "slow down (imp.)", potentially also due to phonetic resemblance.

166.3: fougl pavarrot "tabloids"

fougl pavarrot /fuil ˌpa.vaˈrɔt/ [fwɪl ˌpa.vɐˈʀɔt]
- tabloids, newspapers considered to be more commercial and less prestigious than "high-brow" journalism;
- gutter press, yellow press, sensationalist reporters or newspapers in general;
- sensationalism, puffery, hype, the practise of exaggerating things for attention

Etymology: nineteenth-century phrase coined as an insult, literally meaning "little cash pages"; compare equivalent Merch term "bit-sheets". The noun fougl "leaf; page, sheet" descends via Old Borlish fouȝl from Latin folium "leaf". The noun pavarrot is a diminutive of pavar "poppy", here referring to a particular small coin used on Borland in the early modern period and reintroduced with a different denomination in the late twentieth period. The word descends from synonymous papāver in Latin, of unknown further origin.

166.4: ouger "host"

ouger /uˈʒɛr/ [ʊˈʝɛː]

- host, one who receives or entertains guests;
- emcee, moderator, the person running an event;
- presenter, anchor, the face of a programme on radio, TV, etc.

Etymology: from Middle Borlish ouger "landlord/lady", altered from louger via rebracketing of the definite article. This is an agent derivative of now-obsolete lousc "shelter; inn", borrowed from Old French loge "shelter; covered walkway, hut, small room", via synoymous laubia in Medieval Latin from the Classical German root laubam "leaf, foliage". The word has been applied also to other host roles since the seventeenth century.

166.5: The North Wind and the Sun

The Borrhatic League is a collection of charitable organisations and political action groups with a focus on laic governance, education and (in recent decades) also pacifism and objection. The League grew from collaboration between working-class groups of minority faiths across Northern Europe in the early nineteenth century; the name derives from the Attic Greek Βορρᾶς • Borrhâs "the North Wind". The League first rose to prominences on the scale of polities during the Second German War of the 1820s and in its aftermath. For instance, Hilgart and Michael Bervisson were influential in Borland's Borrhatic League at this time, especially with regards to calls for religious tolerance.

Although the Borrhatic League and the contemporaneous Deviance movement has (occasionally explosive) disagreements, both are known to have contributed verbiage to the 1850 Laic Declarations in Belgrade. Later in the nineteenth century the Borrhatic League funded orphanages and schools across the region, such as the Borrhatic School of History in the south-eastern Borlish city of Combert, which exists to this day.

I Macchine di Helio (The Machines of Helios) is a marble sculpture created by Lorenzo dell'Acchedia in the 1550s, during the regions Revitalist period. It was carved in Acchedia's workshop in Rome and displayed in that city for the first decades of its existence. The work is a stylised depiction of the Greek god Helios "the Sun" with the six known planets gyring around him. The notion of a Sun-centred cosmos that inspired the work may have been transmitted to Acchedia via his close friend Martèl fi Bacchero, mathematician at the library of Saint Jerome, who is recorded to have debated the issue in public fora as early as 1552.

167.2: spanjon "spread"

spanjon /spanˈʒɔn/ [spɐɲˈʝɔn]
- expansion, growth, spread, increase of size, territory or influence;
- elaboration, explanation, further description;
- extension, addition, putting more pieces or sections onto something;
- generalisation, broadening, applying something to new contexts

Etymology: noun derivation from spandr "expand, spread, broaden, explain" or directly from Latin expansio "an instance of spreading out". In either case these derive from Latin root verb pandō "spread, unfold, narrate". The metaphorical senses of expansion are partially modelled after use of the term in Scholastic Latin.

- byname, nickname, moniker, sobriquet, a familiar form of address for someone or something;
- handle, username, a string of characters used to identify an account on a digital system

Etymology: originally in the first sense, a deverbal noun from dobar "confer knighthood upon, dub". This is a borrowing of Old French adober "equip, arm; dub", which appers to come from a German root related to Classical German dubilas "peg, dowel". In extended use the word is seen from as early as the fourteenth century; the first attestation of the last sense is from 1964.

168.2: pegr "lazy"

pegr /pijr̩/ [ˈpi.ʝɐ]
- idle, inactive, motionless, not engaged in any activity;
- asleep, on standby, (of a device) in a mode with the power on but not in active use;
- lazy, indolent, slothful, averse to work or exercise;
- slovenly, unkempt, having an untidy appearance;
- careless, negligent, sloppy, messy, with a lack of attention or precision;
- pointless, inane, silly, occurring to no particular purpose;

Etymology: from Old Borlish peȝr "unintelligent; idle; lazy", a semi-learned descendant of Latin piger "dull, lazy, sluggish; loth, averse". Use of physical appearance is attested from the sixteenth century; in the latter more general senses the word is seen from the early nineteenth century.

168.3: paramontað "supremacy"

paramontað /ˌpa.ra.mɔnˈtað/ [ˌpa.ʀɐ.mʊnˈtah]
- supremacy, dominance, primacy, precedence, the quality of having power or priority;
- liegedom, suzerainty, the political arrangement inverse to vassalage in which one polity has legal control over the governance of another

Etymology: nominal derivation from paramont "supreme, primary". This is a borrowing from Old French, a univerbation of par amont "by upward", from Latin per "through" and ad montem "to a mountain; upwards". The word was originally used in the thirteenth century to describe the relation of the Drengot Emperor over the kings in his demesne.

Il affirmn y paramontað de rigteç sur ley.

- an inner wall in a building;
- partition, any structure that divides an area into sections;
- (anatomy) septum, a biological structure analogous to a partition and often specifically the nasal septum

Etymology: via Old Borlish pereð, paired "bulkhead" from Latin pariēs "wall". This was outcompeted outside nautical contexts by the descendant of Latin mūrus "wall (orig. of a town or city)". The word's anatomical sense is first attested from the seventeenth century in translation from Scholastic Latin.

168.5: And Good And Gay

excerpt from the 1986 work Birds Yet Sing, a popular account by Ivainchuque fi Cap (originally published in Vascon as Ja Cantan Aucèis) of the history of the Household Renovation in the late nineteenth century. This was a precipitous societal shift in attitudes to marriage, family and the role of children, as to the ultimate causes of which there has been much speculation.

…origin of the word "tov" [gay] itself may seem to be evident. The term is attested from the 1810s in the underground tovaric communities of the Riverine Cities [1], and is notable for being (unlike so many similar words) a self-descriptor used to signal ingroup membership, instead of an insult hurled by offended outsiders or the avenging law (whatever it may be avenging). This initial covertness can be seen in the somewhat confused definition given in Manjurich's 1823 work The Vernacular of Boxa [Novi Sad, Serbia] as "a loving salutation between brothers…avoided in polite company".

The existence of the synonymous "tovaric" certainly suggests that "tov" is simply a clipping of e.g. Zahid Russian това́риш • továrish "friend, companion" or one of its cognates, and indeed this connection appears to have been consciously reinforced through the nineteenth century. By the time of the Household Renovation, academic works had further adapted the root, borrowing words like "tovarism" [homosexuality] into dozens of languages.

A closer look into the religious and social dynamics of the Riverine Cities, however, reveals tantalising alternative etymologies. The Riverine Cities were also a hotbed of the Deviance movement due to the presence of significant religious minorities and the entwining of the Church with (resented) local and baronial authority. In particular, there was a significant connection between tovaric circles and the Jewish quarters of cities like Pojon [Bratislava]. Use of the phrase קערל טוב • karl tov "good chap" (the noun coming from German) between Jewish men is attested in correspondence from the mid-eighteenth century.

Another more prosaic idea is that the word "tov" is a clipping in the other direction, a rebracketed form of the patronymic suffix -ov from surnames like Kotov or Soldatov, but…

169.2: sacr "wicked"

sacr /ˈsa.kr̩/ [ˈsa.kɐ]

- essential, vital, key, crucial, pivotal, of extreme importance;
- (colloquial, dated) cool, wicked, awesome, very interesting or impressive in an exciting way

Etymology: originally in the first senses, a Middle Borlish reborrowing from Latin sacer "sacred, holy". With these meanings the words is mostly confined to idioms, collocations (y Bibr Sacr "the Holy Bible") and poetry, supplanted by words like sacrað and sagntað "holy". In the last senses the word was briefly popular in the mid-twentieth century and it is occasionally still used (alongside the comparative sacherrem which saw similar use somewhat later) to evoke the period.

Etymology: Middle Borlish, verbal derivation from scavre, scavle "reflection, mirror image" (exemplifying the confusion regarding final -re/-le which affected contemporary Borlish). This descends from Old Borlish scaure "mirror; reflection; actor", a borrowing from Old English sċēawere "observer, watchman; mirror; jester, buffoon" (cognate with Modern English "show-er").

169.5: Time for T

collected notes on four features of the Boralverse alternate history that begin with the letter T.

Tewis Camigner (fl. c16) was a botanist from Willemy during the Revitalist period, sometimes called the father of farm theory. His writings in experientia include the first reference to the high sugar content of beet syrup, which would go on to inspire the 1730s Pentrose survey. This was a search for a domestic alternative to sugarcane which resulted in the braxoch, a hybrid of Silesian and Cassuvian beets with a characteristic gold colour and the ancestor of almost all modern sugar beets.

Tightrope Walking: a Linguistic History of Borland (originally in Napolitan as Funamblisme: n'Istorio Lingual d'e Isule Bural) is a scholastic quire written by Ghendaline Cecchino and published in 1991 by the Edizore Università Napule. The work chronicles how the Borlish language has changed from the Roman period until the modern day.

Tolose is a city and region in the south of Gaul [France], formerly an independent polity. It was a march (and then a duchy) vassal of the First Drengot Empire in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, bordering the kingdom of Barcelon to the south. However, the region maintined significant independence, with its own standing army. Following the collapse of the First Drengot Empire, Tolose became a hotly contested border region. It was conquered by Vascony from the west in the fifteenth century (see Prince Mark of Tolose, heir to the Vascon throne who predeceased his father in 1453). In the first decade of the sixteenth century, Barcelon conquered Tolose from Vascony, and the region has been territory belonging to the kingdom of Barcelon since (barring some brief exceptions).

Tuscany is an Italian polity on the Tyrrhene Sea, bordering Jeans [Genoa], Lombardy and Rome. Its capital city is Florence. Between the tenth and thirteenth centuries it was ruled by the Pisan dynasty, including the renowned Duchess Matilda (r. 1102-1146). The Italian language of Tuscany has contributed many loanwords to European languages due to the prestige and trade wealth of the region.

170.1: Wales in the Wars

excerpt in translation on the subject of Wales during the Wars of Fealty, and on the Battle of Rexam (1483) in particular.

The relatively new Kingdom of Britain (formed of Wales and its outlying tallaths [provinces], along with Kernow [Brittany] and Sodrick [Man and the Hebrides]) started from a position of strength, and managed to extract many concessions from Markland in the early years of the wars.

170.2: dithyramb "rant"

dithyramb /ˌdi.θiˈramb/ [ˌdi.θɪˈʀamb]
- (historical) dithyramb, a raucous and ardent choral hymn sung in ancient Greece in honor of the god Dionysus;
- ode, ballad, any of various poetic or musical forms characterised by the communication of intense emotions;
- diatribe, rant, tirade, polemic, an impassioned oration or piece of writing (often with positive affect)

Etymology: originally in the first sense, borrowed in the early modern period via Latin from δῑθῠ́ρᾰμβος • dīthŭ́rămbos in Ancient Greek. In poetic use the word has never denoted any particular metre or form; its intentional vagueness has allowed poets to use the term for a diverse array of works. In the last senses the term is attested from the nineteenth century.

170.3: souquondar "lurk"

souquondar /ˌsu.kwɔnˈdar/ [ˌsu.kwʊnˈdɐː]
- lurk, hide, skulk, to lie in wait out of sight;
- prowl, sneak, to move stealthily to avoid detection;
- be dormant, bide one's time, to appear to be inactive while waiting for the best opportunity;
- (botany) of a bulb, to remain underground over winter;
- (medicine) of a disease, to be asymptomatic but still contagious;
- stake out, case, to conduct surveillance upon a location

Etymology: Middle Borlish, derivation with the prefix sou "under, below" from the root aquondar, covondar et al. "lie in wait, ambush". This appears to reflect an unattested Vulgar Latin adjective *accupābundus "lurking, hiding, hunting animals", which would be a confused form influenced by Classical aucupor "I catch birds or bees" and occupō "I occupy, seize, anticipate".

The botanical sense is attested from the seventeenth century, and the medical sense from the nineteenth. The last senses appear to have arisen in journalistic circles within the past few decades.

170.4: theu "habit"

theu /θau/ [θau]
- wont, habit, custom, practice, way, MO, one's usual manner of doing things;
- will, willpower, free will, the capacity to act and make decisions to carry out one's wishes;
- persistence, wilfulness, headstrongness, stubbornness, the quality of refusing to change one's opinions or actions

Etymology: direct descendant of Old Borlish theu, thau "wont; behaviour", borrowed from synonymous þēaw in Old English. In the last senses the word usually has positive affect, unlike otherwise comparable words like obstinaç "obstinacy". Puns on this word with the name Theo are attested from the eighteenth century, possibly as soon as the words became homophonous in many Borlish dialects.

170.5: Decim(alis)ation

excerpt from the 1st July 1975 edition of the Scavlour (Reflecter), a workdaily paper from Borland which focuses on political news.

…impractical to import astraphor [electricity] from Portingale.

GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES FIRST DECIMATION IN FIFTY YEARS

In a long-anticipated move, the Ministry for Wealth has confirmed that all four conditions of the '15 Food Prices Act have been met. The gemma (⍚), which has been the base unit of Borlish currency since 1925, is to be first supplemented and eventually replaced with a coin worth 10⍚.

Minister Gottart has expressed his intention that new coin and notes denominated in the new currency will enter circulation on David's Day of 1977. For the next four months the ministry is accepting public input on the name and designs of the new coinage, although calls for a popular vote on the final name have been rejected (perhaps due to the unfortunate example of Burgundy, which went through its own decimation three years ago). No timeline has yet been confirmed for the deprecation of the gemma, but exchange schemes are likely to be available for at least a year after gemma-denominated coins are no longer legal tender.

This will be only the third currency in Borland since the polity moved to a decimal system of coinage upon its 1894 incorporation into the Drengot Collusion. The process of so-called "decimation" is common to all Drengot successor states and has been taken up by several others through the twentieth century. It obtained its violent name as a cod-Latin pun and insult by Sarzan Dawkinholm, one-time Outland Minister in Markland and one of the most vociferous opponents to decimation.

The necessity of decimation has been questioned by trade theorists, especially given that many parts of the world seem to have no issue spending hundreds or thousands of the local currency on (say) a loaf of bread, but…

171.1: Maritime Cards

notes in translation on the subject of the Maritime deck of cards, which have five suits: gold, bucklers, staves, jewels and arrows.

Doutr allors, magn entr y blad aun cas ustol un dob desjognt deur lorry step eð ensign—com bustr, y dou de verc dign y Duel, cant y set de jovel es connuð com y Constellaçon.
Many of the cards furthermore have conventional titles separate to their rank and ensign—for example, the deuce of staves is called the Duel, while the sept of jewels is known as the Stars.

In games where some cards trump the rest, the gold ensign typically takes this role, but some more modern games will use the aforementioned "named" cards in this way.

171.2: vancar "loot"

vancar /vanˈkar/ [vɐŋˈkɐː]
- loot, pillage, plunder, snatch, to get possession of underhandedly;
- catch, secure, nail, nab, apprehend, seize, to get hold of and prevent from leaving one's grasp;
- win, to receive as a reward

Etymology: early Modern Borlish, verbal derivation from vanc "catch, haul; loot, plunder". This was borrowed from Willem Dutch verb vangen "to catch", a descendant (modelled after the preterite forms) from Classical German fanhō "I take, seize". In the last sense the word is attested from the early twentieth century.

Vancheu toð vençabr dell'oc vessondry.

171.3: visnous "gnarly"

visnous /vɪˈznuz/ [vɪˈznuz]
- wizened, rugged, made rough by age or exposure;
- gaunt, haggard, emaciated, looking severely ill and malnourished;
- gnarly, knotty, knobbly, bumpy, shaped like wood with many knots

Etymology: Middle Borlish, adjectival derivation from now-obsolete verb visnar "to wither". This descends from an Old Borlish borrowing from Old English wisnian "dry up, shrivel". The arboreal senses (literally or figuratively) are now the most current, with a noun visn "knot in wood" having been backformed from the adjective.

Il ern zaquesc visnous a tatover pascent.
/ɪl ɛrn zaˈkwɛx vɪˈznuz a ˌta.toˈvɛr ˈpa.xɛnt/

171.4: ne minemini "eeny meeny miney moe"

ne minemini /ne miˌne.miˈni/ [ˌne.mɪˌne.mɪˈni]
- (law) the presumption of innocence, the legal principle that an accused party is innocent until they are found guilty;
- benefit of the doubt, an appeal to this principle in more general settings;
- eeny meeny miney moe, an (essentially) meaningless phrase at the beginning of any of various children's rhymes which involve pointing at people or things in turn with the goal of picking one

Etymology: fourteenth century in legal Latin as nē minēminī "do not threaten, do not accuse", from the prohibitive particle nē and the second-person plural subjunctive of deponent verb minor "I threaten, accuse". Its original denotation was closer to a admonition against obtaining confessions by duress or threats, only attaining its modern meaning in the seventeenth century. Shortly thereafter the phrase appears in nursery rhymes, presumably more for phonetic reasons than any semantic connection. Nonetheless, some have dubiously linked these rhymes to the act of picking a scapegoat for a crime.

Nos orruð stou le fornir con ne minemini.
/nɔz ɔˈrɪθ stu le fɔrˈnɪr kɔn ne miˌne.miˈni/

171.5: Novomundine Landfall

The Novomundine Landfall (Borlish Abanc Novomondin) occurred in 1471 N, when a ship that was part of a New Navarre Enterprise fishing expedition in the North Atlantic sighted and made landfall on the island of Brasil [Newfoundland]. It marks the start of prolonged contact between the Vetomund [Afroeurasia] and the Novomund [Americas] (notwithstanding evidence of sporadic Norrish [Norse] contact with the region), and the first century following the Landfall is known to historians as the Intertwining Century.

The terms Novomund and Mendeva [North America] date to this voyage; a surviving map from the Landfall voyage itself is marked terrae mendevalensis, after the Vask [Basque] mendeval "west".

The Landfall occurred at the height of the so-called Vascon Ascendancy, when Vascony [N Spain, SW France] reached its territorial maximum under Ambrose III, and the trade opportunities that arose over the following decades were just as beneficial for the polity. Ambrose's rival, Munir al-Hamdawi of Morrack [Morocco], quickly redirected the efforts of his presciently-named New World Company westward (having previously maintained trade routes to the East), leading to the discovery of the faster southern route to the Novomund and the islands of the Arcabil [Caribbean].

The first Vetomundine royal to set foot in the Novomund was King Ambrose's elder sister Princess Alexandra of Vascony, who visited the new settlement of Paratzon [St John's, NL] in the 1490s. It is unknown why she (and several female attendants) undertook the voyage, although her second husband's various deficiencies and scandals have been implicated. Her visit is remembered for advancing understanding of scurvy (the chemical sandrine [vitamin C] is named in her honour), although it would take over a century and experiments with guy-conies [guinea pigs] before ships could come close to effectively preventing the malady.

172.2: allocquar "address"

allocquar /ˌa.lɔˈkwar/ [ˌa.lʊˈkwɐː]
- address, speak to, to communicate with by means of speech;
- affect, touch, impact, to have some sort of relevance to or effect upon;
- (dated) court, woo, romance, to endeavour to gain someone's affections

Etymology: Middle Borlish, borrowed (with regularised conjugation modelled after collocquar "converse") from Latin alloquor "I address, greet", derived from the root loquor "I speak". The term is seen in metaphorical use from the eighteenth century, and in romantic contexts from around the same time.

Lor rou y diac ouð y ley vel y taus terren allocquar.

incombir /ˌɪn.kɔmˈbɪr/ [ˌɪŋ.kʊmˈbɪː]
- behove, befit, benefit, suit, to be proper or advantageous for someone to do;
- incite, impel, urge, provoke, to provide an impetus to do;
- press, overlay, to put pressure upon from above;
- loom, tower, to stand tall nearby (usually in a threatening manner)

Etymology: originally in the first senses, a Middle Borlish borrowing from Latin incumbō "I lie upon, I recline". The physical senses are attested later and may be based on the Latin (or may show influence from related descombr "go to bed, lie down to sleep).

T'incombisce te leyar tostessem.

172.4: ostendar "blog"

ostendar /ˌɔ.stɛnˈdar/ [ˌɔ.stɪnˈdɐː]
- exhibit, display, to show for public consumption;
- publish, to have (usually a work of writing) publicised via some outlet;
- blog, post, to write (or otherwise create content) and publish on the pistol mesh [Internet]

Etymology: early Modern Borlish, a borrowing (probably via a French or Italian language) from Latin ostendō "I expose to view, reveal". In journalism the term originally connoted commercial writing as opposed to actual news. In the context of the mesh there are attestations from the earliest meshfora in the late 1960s.

172.5: How to spell Borlish

I've finally started a proper reference work for Borlish; I've finished the orthography section!

Here are the twenty-seven letters of the standard Borlish alphabet, along with their letter names.

The character ‹ w ›, which is used in foreign words and some names (like Willaum ‘William’), is pronounced like ‹ v › and called vescon ‘second-vee’. There are also some compound characters. The ligatures ‹ æ œ ›, primarily used in Classical loanwords, are called æsc and œthel respectively and pronounced as if written ‹ e ›. The character ‹ ï › is referred to as i jammel ‘twin i’ and pronounced as if written ‹ yi ›.

In the following we will consider ‹ y › to be a vowel when written between consonants and/or word boundaries, and a consonant otherwise.

Consonants

The following letters regularly denote a single phoneme.

Of these, the letters ‹ b d f l m n p r › may appear doubled, which usually does not affect their pronunciation.

    abbað joddy affis ollom commet bannir çoppin arrum
    /aˈbaθ ʒɔˈdi aˈfɪz ɔˈlɔm kɔˈmɛt baˈnɪr tsɔˈpɪn aˈrɪm/
    abbot cuppa tip relic ban start toffee cosine

The only exception to this is that ‹ mm nn rr › may denote a single consonant followed by a syllabic consonant. This is the reading when ‹ mm nn rr › occurs word-finally or before a consonant.

    yem-m grin-n car-r
    /ˈjɛm.m̩ ˈgrɪn.n̩ ˈkar.r̩/
    get-1p judge-3p seek-inf

The letter ‹ ð › is pronounced /θ/ word-finally and /ð/ otherwise; the letter ‹ x › regularly denotes the phoneme sequence /ks/.

Consider the final six letters ‹ c g h s t y › when they occur alone (not part of a digraph). In this case, the letters ‹ t y › regularly denote /t j/ respectively. The letter /t/ may be doubled, without any effect on its pronunciation.

    tien yoc cattin
    /tjɛn jɔk | kaˈtɪn/
    yours husband kitten

The letter ‹ c › is pronounced /ts/ before ‹ e i y › and /k/ otherwise. The doubled ‹ cc › is pronounced /kts/ before ‹ e i y › and /k/ otherwise.

By contrast, the letter ‹ g › may be pronounced as either of /g ʒ/ before ‹ e i y › and is pronounced /g/ otherwise (and similarly for doubled ‹ gg ›).

    cigl cuivr bac | gevou genoil tenguð
    /tsajl ˈkajv.r̩ bak | geˈvu ʒeˈnɔjl tɛnˈgɪθ/
    darling copper twig | (watch out) knee bauble

The letter ‹ h › is either pronounced /h/ or is silent (the latter only in some vocabulary inherited from Latin and after vocalic ‹ g ›); The letter ‹ s › is pronounced /z/ in coda position or between vowels, and /s/ otherwise or when doubled.

    heu hom augher | bevis bosaç bustr bossir
    /hau ɔm oˈjɛr | beˈvɪz boˈzats ˈbɪst.r̩ bɔˈsɪr/
    mien person tumbler | note gunfire example gent

Consonant digraphs

The six letters ‹ c g h s t y › combine with other graphemes to form digraphs. The sequences ‹ sc ch th › regularly denote the phonemes /x k θ/. The potentially ambiguous sequence ‹ sch › is read /sk/. The sequence ‹ cq › is pronounced /k/.

    sclar chym thral schol jalicq
    /xlar kɪm θral skɔl ʒaˈlɪk/
    lightning lymph slave school tuxedo

The graphemes ‹ g y › only form digraphs when combined with vowels, for which see below.
Vowels

Divide written vowels into two groups. Free vowels are either wordfinal or separated from the next vowel in the word by a single consonant grapheme (or one of ‹ sc ch th ›).

    choma epu idiocy nothe
    /koˈma eˈpi ˌi.djoˈtsi noˈθe/
    gnome express stupidity illegitimate

Checked vowels are either in a final closed syllable or separated from the next vowel in the word by at least two consonant graphemes.

    commun ambasctour sincer
    /kɔˈmɪn ˌam.baxˈtur sɪnˈtsɛr/
    ordinary emissary genuine

Now consider the letters ‹ a e i o u y › when they occur alone (not part of a digraph). When they are free, ‹ a e i o u y › when they occur alone (not part of a digraph). When they are free, ‹ a e i o u y › are pronounced /a e i o i i/.

    cla vige bro cru try
    /kla viˈʒe bro kri tri/
    key wealthy dude raw turn

When they are checked, ‹ a e i o u y › are pronounced /a ɛ ɪ ɔ ɪ ɪ/.

    vindron vampyr effus
    /vɪnˈdrɔn vamˈpɪr ɛˈfɪz/
    vintner vampire extensive

Between a consonant and one of the vowels ‹ a e o u ›, the graphemes ‹ i u › denote the semivowel ‹ j ›. The grapheme ‹ u › denotes the semivowel /w/ specifically after ‹ q ›.

    diac suet quelt
    /djak sjɛt kwɛlt/
    mic familiar dinner

Vowel digraphs

The digraphs ‹ au eu ou › are pronounced /o au u/ respectively. The rarer ‹ ao eo › share their pronunciation with ‹ eu ›.

    taur teun tout | paon theory
    /tor taun tut | paun thauˈri/
    bull scant everything | peacock science

The digraphs ‹ ai ei oi ui › and ‹ ay ey oy uy › are pronounced /e i ɔj aj/ respectively. Intervocalically, ‹ y › does double duty, simultaneously affecting the previous vowel as stated and acting as an onset ‹ j ›.

    deit joivr | rayon huyaç
    /dit ˈʒɔjv.r̩ | reˈjɔn haˈjats/
    finger frost | sunbeam corruption

The vast majority of coda ‹ g › and some other ‹ g › before consonants form vowel digraphs. Here, the digraphs ‹ ag eg ig og ug aug oug › may be pronounced /ɛj ɪj aj ɔj aj oj uj/ respectively.

    bag deg rig pog tug faug voug
    /bɛj dɪj raj pɔj taj foj vuj/
    berry ten queue few passion sickle wrong

However, there are cases where a ‹ g › in one of the above environments is read consonantally.

173.2: entrquïscoir "break room"

entrquïscoir /ˌɛntr̩ˌkwajiˈxɔir/ [ˌɛn.tɐˌkwajˈxɔ.jɐ]
- break room, a space in a workspace set aside for staff to spend short periods away from work to e.g. eat or talk;
- (metaphorically) respite, a brief interval of rest or relief between times of some unpleasant experience

Etymology: mid-twentieth century, place derivation (using the suffix -oir < -ōrium in Medieval Latin) from the verb entrquïr "pause, stop work". This is a late medieval borrowing from Latin interquiēscō "I rest briefly", adapted to native prefix entr- "between" and verb quïr "to put out, turn off".

173.3: contrdontaçon "downfall"

contrdontaçon /ˌkɔntr̩ˌdɔn.taˈtsɔn/ [ˌkɔn.tɐˈdɔn.tɐˈtsɔn]
- downfall, fall, doom, demise, defeat, a loss that is particularly noteworthy or spectacular;
- disgrace, humiliation, a sudden nosedive in public opinion of someone or something

Etymology: noun derivation from the verb contrdontar "foil, stymie, thwart". This is a pleonastic extension of now-obsolete dontar "thwart, defeat", which descends from Latin domitō "I tame, I vanquish".

173.4: mesaventoresq "shambolic"

mesaventoresq /ˌme.zaˌvɛn.toˈrɛsk/ [ˌme.zɐˌvɛn.tʊˈʀɛsk]
- farcical, clownish, slapstick, comprising a series of ridiculous goings-on;
- shambolic, pell-mell, haphazard, with a complete lack of sensible organisation;

Etymology: nineteenth century, a blend of two preexisting words. The first is mesaventur "mishap, accident", which comprises the prefix mes- "badly" (from Germanic) and the obsolete noun aventur "event, chance"; the second is aventoresq "swashbuckling, gleefully adventurous", a borrowing via Parisian from synonymous avventoresco in Tuscan.

173.5: American Toponymy

    excerpts from the Veriloquace Glossary o'Mendevan Placenames, a reference quire in the Merch language compiled by Rotcham [Rochdale] University Primers.

Ax /aks/ [~SW Alaska] a peninsular polity in northwestern Mendeva [North America], along with the surrounding mainland region and an extended chain of islands leading west into the northern Lovaqua [Pacific]. 1780 < French l'Axe < poss. Vascon or Portingale l'Axa, a Axa < early 18C Arabic الأَقْصَى • al-Aqśá "the Furthest" < folk etymology from Oranger [Aleut] alaxsxaq "mainland", influenced by its northerly location and sheer distance from Mashick [Mexico]. Originally referring specifically to the peninsula, the term was extended to the island chain itself by the Morrack [Moroccan] surveyors who first recorded the term in a Vetmundine [Afroeurasian] language.

Bahassassin /ˌba.hɐˈsa.sɪn/ [Mississippi River] the longest and most voluminous river in Mendeva at over twenty hundred leagues, flowing south into the Gulf of the Arcabil [Gulf of Mexico] through Hasiny. 1704 < Mid 17C Welsh Bahassassin < Carovacian [Caddo] báhassássin "mother of rivers".

Cocain /kʊˈkəin/ [Cuba] the largest of the islands of the Arcabil [Caribbean], or the polity that occupies this region and part of mainland Mendeva. 1530, repurposing of the word's previous meaning of "an imaginary land of folklore with an abundance of food, drink and other pleasures". This dates back to the late 14C < French Cocagne, Lombard Cuccagna, of uncertain further origin. The term has been connected to Willem Dutch cúkye "small cake" < Classical German cōcoō "cake" and to Old Irish cucann "food ration" < Latin coquīna "kitchen", but both have issues of provenance.

174.2: de sanc ðus "horny"

de sanc ðus /de sank ðɪz/ [de saŋk ðɪz]
- hot-blooded, hot-tempered, heated, easily provoked to anger or excitement;
- passionate, ardent, zealous, fervent, given to strong expression of emotions;
- horny, lustful, torrid, beset by sexual feelings

Etymology: idiom attested from the seventeenth century, coined approximately at the same time as de sanc freit "cold-blooded, emotionless", literally meaning "of burning blood". The noun sanc "blood" descends directly from Latin sanguis "blood" (albeit from a Vulgar oblique form like sanguem rather than Classical sanguinem). The adjective ðus "on fire" is the past participle of now-archaic verb ðurr "burn (tr.), set on fire", which reflects Latin adūrō "I kindle, set fire to". In the last senses the phrase is attested from the nineteenth century.

I stima vos fosseð un hom troç e de sanc ðus.
/i stiˈma vɔz fɔˈsɛθ ɪn ɔm trɔts e de sank ðɪz/

174.3: bland "interesting"

bland /bland/ [bland]
- suave, debonair, urbane, affable, charming, of smooth and sociable demeanour;
- well-liked, popular, widely admired by people;
- interesting, entertaining, compelling, engaging people's attention;
- complicated, detailed, having a multitude of facets or features;
- sophisticated, worldly, cosmopolitan, having had plenty of varied experiences and lacking naïveté

Etymology: Middle Borlish, a borrowing from Latin blandus "pleasant, agreeable; fawning, flattering". In the first senses the word originally had a somewhat negative or insincere connotation; by the eighteenth century the word is mostly seen in uncomplicatedly positive use.

Racont mey dy domn bland voscon encontrað.
/raˈkɔnt mi di ˈdɔmn̩ bland voˈxɔn ˌɛn.kɔnˈtraθ/

174.4: plentivous "brimming"

plentivous /ˌplɛn.tiˈvuz/ [ˌplɛn.tɪˈvuz]
- brimming, awash, flush, overflowing, in such an abundance as to be almost too much;
- (in physics) charged, having an electrical charge;
- suspenseful, tense, thrilling, expectant, filled with the tension of awaiting an uncertain outcome or event

Etymology: late Middle Borlish, borrowed from French plentiveus "flush, rich". This is a derivation from plentif "abundant" and plenté "abundance", via Latin plēnitās "fullness" from plēnus "full". The emotional senses, attested from the seventeenth century, appear to evoke the danger of an overfull vessel. In scientific use the word is modelled on prior plentað "fullness; (physic) electric charge" (compare the analogous plentiful "charged" in Merch).

excerpt in translation from 1967 trevold Un Aœd des Uisq ("A Bard out of Owisk", fourth book in the Xiphary "Sellswords" series), written by a Borlish writing duo who collectively went by the name Pincerno (possibly based on Latin pincerna "cupbearer").

175.2: nuivr "hilt"

nuivr /naivr̩/ [ˈnai.vɐ]
- hilt, haft, grip, the part of a sword or similar weapon that one holds in the hand;
- handle, the analogous part of any handheld tool;
- root, bitter end, quick, core, the furthest or most extreme portion or some thing or process

Etymology: aphaeretic form of earlier manuivre "hilt" attested from the fifteenth century, a direct descendant of synonymous manubrium in Latin. In metaphorical use it is most often seen in idioms like vars y nuivr "to the bitter end, unreservedly".

Frastr intermane y nuivr dy hax.

175.3: ollom "relic"

ollom /ɔˈlɔm/ [ʊˈlɔm]
- relic, an ancient object (originally as kept for religious veneration);
- heirloom, a valued possession passed down over generations;
- artefact, antique, a very old item;
- keepsake, souvenir, token, memento, an item with sentimental value often as a reminder of something or someone

Etymology: a descendant of Old Borlish onlom "vessel; (religion) relic", borrowed from Borland Old English ondlōma "utensil, vessel". By the thirteenth century the word had become restricted to religious usage (viewing a relic as a vessel for holy power), from which the other senses have sprung.

Val l'oc ollom se figr n'un reliquat.

175.4: yemal "cool"

yemal /jeˈmal/ [ʝɪˈmal]
- wintry, chilly, cold, pertaining to or reminiscent of winter;
- standoffish, cool, making no overtures of politeness or friendliness;
- stern, severe, strict, acting without flexibility or mercy

Etymology: Middle Borlish (h)iemal "wintry", borrowed from Latin hiemālis "pertaining to winter", from hiems "winter". The term lost its initial h- (unlike most contemporaneous Latin borrowings) due to contamination from native yarn "winter" < Latin hībernum "winter". Emotional extension of the term is seen shortly thereafter, in parallel to stival "summery, friendly".

My patron me lançau un scoul yemal.

175.5: Stillian

collected notes on the subject of King Stillian, a medieval Borlish ruler.

Stillian of Borland (r. ca. 790–823 N, Borlish Stiglan /stajˈlan/) was king of Roman Borland in the late eighth and early ninth centuries. This so-called First Kingdom of Borland had grown out of the sub-Roman Diocese of Boral in the early medieval period, having become a monarchy in tandem with (and possibly influenced by) the new petty kingdoms settled by Germanic peoples in the west and south of the island of Borland.

Like all kings of Roman Borland, Stillian claimed to be descended from Victor Rossetus, the semi-mythic figure who united much of the land once external Roman authority receded in the fifth century. The name Stillian descends from Latin Hostīliānus, attested also as the name of a Roman emperor who ruled briefly in 251 N.

Stillian is primarily remembered for actions which put an end to the perennial Tripartite Wars and unifed the island under one polity for the first time since the Roman Empire. This term refers to a centuries-long series of conflicts over territory and fealty, principally between Roman Borland and the kingdoms of Southbar and Angland; by the eighth century these three powers controlled the vast majority of the island. Kings of Borland had made temporary alliances before with either of Southbar and Angland.

In 803, Stillian's son Marc was married to Alfegh of Angland's only child (variously recorded as Raunilt or Raunvig, likely from Old English hræfn "raven" and a name element like hild or wig "war, battle"). The two royal dynasties had been connected by marriage before, and this wedding allowed both kingdoms to claim continuity with the new unified polity. Approximately seven years later, Southbar was forced to pledge fealty to the new kingdom after the Battle of Fendal.

The cities of the Mesh are popularly associated with wheeling-and-dealing policy, as well as aggressive and global use of espionage. However, the extent to which the Mesh was (for example) able to steer politics in the East to their trade benefit is likely overestimated.

In the late nineteenth century, London led the Mesh to unite politically with the Drengot Collusion, which at the time was a nascent alliance of the French polities of Norman Kent, Paris and Burgundy. Whether it is more correct to say that the Mesh was subsumed into the Collusion, or that the Mesh took control of the Collusion, has long been a topic of heated debate.

176.2: n'impisantour "carefree"

n'impisantour /nɪmˌpi.zanˈtur/ [nɪmˌpi.zɐnˈtʊː]
- weightless, in freefall, accelerating due to gravitional forces alone;
- unencumbered, unburdened, not carrying any load;
- carefree, untroubled, unconcerned, not feeling any worry;
- insouciant, blithe, nonchalant, ignoring any potential concerns (perhaps recklessly or impolitely);

Etymology: 1812, coined along with the noun impisantour "weightlessness" during the voidtale craze of popular fiction set out among the stars. The noun is from the much older pisantour "weightiness", itself from adjective pisant "weighty, burdensome". These all derive originally from pis "weight", the descendant of synonymous pēnsum in Latin. In extended use the word is attested from the late nineteenth century, with the slightly disparaging connotation established shortly thereafter.

176.3: jom "cobalt"

jom /ʒɔm/ [ʝɔm]
- cobalt, the corporal [element] with twenty-seven mora [protons] and which is a hard and lustrous silver-grey metal;
- deep blue, a colour produced from the ash [oxide] or chalk [carbonate] of this corporal (or a similar hue of any origin)

Etymology: sixteenth century from Scholastic Latin iomus or Tuscan jomo, originally referring to a sort of blue pigment containing cobalt often used to dye glass. These are trade-words borrowed from the east, via (Bagliemman) Arabic from Turk or Persian جام • jām "glass". The term was repurposed for the metal once it was isolated in the late seventeenth century.

176.4: gevrment "circuitry"

gevrment /ˌgɛvr̩ˈmɛnt/ [ˌgɛ.vɐˈmɛnt]

- nitty-gritty, nuts and bolts, the (possibly figurative) inner workings of any object or concept;
- minutiae, intricacies, the (often trivial) tiny or precise details of a situation

Etymology: derivation with the gestalt suffix -ment < Latin -mentum from the noun gevr "electrical wire". This is a borrowing via synomous guèvre in Parisian from Welsh guivr "wire". In turn this appears to have been borrowed from Old English wīr "metal thread", likely influenced in form by guevr "amber" due to the latter's electrical properties. In metaphorical use the term is seen from the mid-twentieth century.

176.5: The Light that Casts a Thousand Shadows

The Light that Casts a Thousand Shadows (originally published in Borlish as Un Flam, Mil Ombr "1 Flame, 1000 Shadows") was a 2017 N work of pop history, economics and philosophy written by Ollamec Vamncoury and published by a subsidiary of the Peujon Rous (Red Dove) media guild.

Her book chronicles the duelling ideologies of Ubiquity and Vicinity, whose rivalry defined many of the greatest conflicts of the twentieth century and which together form the basis for most modern schools of political though. In broad strokes, Ubiquity stands for equality, universalism and homogeneity, while Vicinity valourises liberty, localism and diversity.

Despite various administrations' propaganda, neither ideology holds the undisputed moral high ground. Vicinity has been linked to the flourishing of regional languages and to the freedom to pursue nontraditional familial structures; it has also been used to justify the formation of ghettos and even ethnostates. Ubiquity has led to the toppling of truly oppressive hierarchies in the name of egalitarian redistribution of wealth and power; it has also marginalised and attempted to extirpate elements of society that do not fit into one of the many visions for society that leaders have propounded.

However, the point of Ollamec's work is in fact to complicate the idea that these two frameworks are naturally opposed and completely contradictory. She achieves this in part by noting the many times that similar policies have been justified by appeals to both Ubiquity and Vicinity in different times or places. For example, the modern Runeplate Body headquartered in Lengrod [Lviv] determines the global standard for glyphs in almost all known writing systems. This centralisation is undoubtedly Ubiquitous in nature, yet the inclusion of such a diversity of scripts is a far cry from post-Millstone Mashick [Mexico] and their ambitions of "one world language".

177.2: ubicqfeyar "promote"

ubicqfeyar /ˌi.bɪk.fiˈjar/ [ˌi.bɪkˈfjɐː]
- market, publicise, promote, to make everyone aware of;
- popularise, to cause to be mainstream or fashionable;
- (reflexive) go viral, trend, to suddenly become popular or well-known;

Etymology: twentieth century, a derivation from adjective ubicq "ubiquitous, omnipresent" < Latin ubīque "everywhere" with the causative suffix -feyar < Latin -ficō "I make _". This was originally a somewhat derogatory term for annoying advertisement. The word has not entirely shaken off this connotation, partially due to its shared root with the totalising ideology of Ubiquity to which many of Borland's geopolitical rivals subscribed during this period.

177.3: soucorsour "lifeguard"

soucorsour /ˌsu.kɔrˈsur/ [ˌsu.kʊːˈsʊː]
- (historical) bodyguard, attendant, someone who protects a dignitary (often a monarch) from direct harm;
- lifeguard, lifesaver, an expert swimmer employed to rescue people at risk of drowning;
- (by extension) saviour, hero, someone who has just saved the speaker from a dangerous or embarrassing situation

Etymology: Middle Borlish, an agentive derivation from verb soucorrir "rescue, go and help, come to the aid of". This descends from Latin succurrō "I help, aid, succour", adapted synchronically to the etymological sou- "under" prefix and corrir "run" root. The historical sense had been out of use for approximately two centuries before the modern senses appear, and so the latter are presumably an independent rederivation.

Etymology: early modern Borlish derivation from the root tourm "troop; barracks", which conflates contemporary French tourme "platoon" and Dutch torem "fort". The word has been used metaphorically of products since the mid-twentieth century, and is seen in jocular use from around the same time.

177.5: C is for Chronology

collected notes on features of the Boralverse alternate history that begin with the letter C.

Coscatl bint Inám (fl. 1869) was a Mashick [Mexican] astronomer. She was born in the then-young city of Moshtar [~San Francisco]; she received her further education at the University of Anawack [~Mexico City] and the nearby observatory at Chapel Hill [Chapoltepec]. As an astronomer, bint Inám is remembered for discovering and helping to name several astronomical objects. These include the moons of Mars, Dimus [Phobos] and Phobus [Deimos], and most famously the eighth-most distant planet of Janus [Neptune]. Furthermore, her calculations of the perceived timing of the jovial phares [Galiliean moons] in their transits of Jupiter helped to pin down the speed of light.

Crain (Bavarn /krɑːn/, Borlish Carniol /karˈnjɔl/) is a region of Central Europe, east of Furlain [Friuli] and north of Crovatia [Croatia]. During the Second Tetrarchy of the eleventh and twelfth centuries it was a march in the southeasternmost part of the German Empire, initially automonous but later subordinate to the Kingdom of Bavarn. It was prosperous at this time mostly due to trade into its coastal city of Trieste. During the German Secession of the thirteenth century, when many polities broke ties with the Roman Pope in favour of the (hastily established) Augsburg See, the then-duchy of Crain supported the Roman Papacy. This was likely more from pragmatism than religious fervour, as its western and southern neighbours were both partisan of Rome. Nonetheless, the region become an important Roman stronghold, and the base from which it undertook the Baptism of the North.

Cuonrat Aihuosc (fl. c8?, name often Latinised to Corradus Aevoscus) was the dubiously historical founder of the noble house of Avosche and namesake of the region of Avosche in Willemy [~Lotharingia]. His surname is of obscure origin; the first element presumably reflects Classical German ehu- "horse", while the second may be from suffix -iscas "-ish" (though the vowel is problematic).

The Romantic Wars were a loosely-circumscribed collection of wars, uprisings and other conflicts across Europe which took place through the middle of the seventeenth century.

178.2: locomoçon "travel"

locomoçon /ˌlo.ko.moˈtson/ [ˌlo.kʊ.mʊˈtsɔn]
- locomotion, motion, movement, the act or capability of changing position by going from one place to another;
- travel, the activity of going from place to place (usually when in a vehicle like a car or train);
- (physics) displacement, the vector quantity measuring the difference between two points in space

Etymology: sixteenth century, borrowed from Scholastic Latin locomōtiō "movement from place to place", from Classical Latin noun locus "place" and verb moveō "I move". The word is sometimes in technical contexts contrasted with moçon "motion of parts of a body relative to other parts". Its mathematical sense is attested from the eighteenth century as the vector counterpart of scalar lonctumn "length, distance".

178.3: malestr "discomfort"

malestr /maˈlɛstr̩/ [mɐˈlɛ.stɐ]
- unease, disquiet, concern, worry, a dissatisfaction with how things are unfolding;
- discomfort, soreness, irritation, issues with how one is physically feeling;
- bad mood, gloom, pessimism, a tendency to see things in the worst possible light;
- snit, moodiness, sulk, a propensity to displays of bad temper and impatience

Etymology: descendant of Old Borlish malestre "discomfort". This was a compound of mal "bad", which descends from synonymous malus in latin, and estre "being, state" (a former infinitive of "be" since replaced by star), which descends from Latin essere "to be". The word has extended to cover various bad or unpleasant emotions, competing for space with hougr "fear, annoyance, discontent" < Latin augurium "omen, warning, foreboding".

No sceye l'hour por commorar ne malestr.

178.4: y voç se hoccovar "clear one's throat"

y voç se hoccovar /i vɔts se ˌhɔ.koˈvar/ [i vɔts se ˌhɔ.kʊˈvɐː]
- clear one's threat, harrumph, to cough in order to make it easier to speak or to attract people's attention to you

Etymology: idiom attested from the eighteenth century, literally "to cough the voice". The noun voç "voice" descends directly from synonymous vox, vocis in Latin. The verb hoccovar "cough" is a derivation from noun hocco "cough, ahem, hem-hem", thought to be of onomatopoeic origin.

Tu te hoccovau y voç e cou ouç.

178.5: Campottonì and Gorram

some notes on a pair of cities in New Provence, situated across a bay from each other.

Campottonì (Doccian /kãˌpɔ.tuˈni/; Merch /kɐmˈpɔ.tʊ.ni/) is a coastal city on the southern bank of the Guittoc [Delaware] river, in the Nappejoquin[1] region of New Provence. Founded in the late seventeenth century as a Provincial staddomain, it was intended to be a major trading port and to control the flow of goods along the Guittoc.

The second half of the placename reflects the Nappe term [Unami] utaney "city"; the first half is of obscure origin (clearly adapted to Doccian camp "field") but may be related to Nappe necama "first". In this case the toponym likely means "mother-city, home city"; compare the similar formation of μητρόπολῐς "metropolis" in Ancient Greek. 

The settlement languished through the eighteenth century due to unfavourable marshy terrain and the better harbours across the river and further inland. Fortunes changed in the nineteenth with an influx of funds: a major shipping canal across the peninsula (connecting the Guittoc to the wealthy Esquanna [Susquehanna] river system) was dug, and the marshlands surrounding Campottonì were drastically canalised and drained. Further widening of the canal took place into the twentieth century.

Briefly known as the "Venice of Mendeva [North America]", Campottonì gained a fashionable reputation during the Good Game Period [late 19C] and by the modern day had risen to become a cultural and economic powerhouse.

Gorram (Doccian /guˈram/; Merch /ˈgɔ.ɾəm/) is a coastal city on the northern bank of the Guittoc [Delaware] river, in the Nappejoquin region of New Provence. It had extremely humble beginnings as a single Provincial farmhouse or possibly a collection of pastures.

There are Provincial dialect terms gorra "goat" and gorram "herd of goats" cognate with cavra and cavram in standard Doccian—the suffix -am forming collective nouns descends from -(ā)men in Latin—and this is generally agreed to be the origin of the placename; compare the similar formation of Gotham (Merch /ˈgɔ.təm/), a village in Markland.

For a time in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Gorram became by far the most important city on the river, having a better natural harbour. It also participated in the convoy [train, rail] craze of the mid-nineteenth century, being the terminus of an arterial line to the northeast.

Even into the twentieth century Gorram was a major hub of industry on a par with Campottonì. However, by the modern day a lack of infrastructural investment in its own drained land and an inability to deindustrialise gracefully had led the city to become much poorer than its counterpart across the bay.

179.1: The Duke of Dark Corners

excerpt in translation from The Duke of Dark Corners (originally published in Welsh as Dug y Gilfah Dowł, meaning the same thing), an 1884 work of historical parachthony [speculative fiction] by author Taguen ah Owain. Her alternate version of the Medieval Imperia (a period of European and circum-Mediterranean centralisation in the eleventh and twefth centuries) features an entirely fictitious set of empires ruled not from Paris, Bardwick, Stamboul and Cairo [1], as in reality, but instead from Damvath [capital of Borland], Florence, Tanger and Kiew.

Y nievr mattin se penen sur y pil n'ollem dy havan cant Fraðr Aldric folla un camin tras y rout bassem ny citað caver.

179.2: martelment "thud"

martelment /ˌmar.tɛlˈmɛnt/ [ˌmɐː.tɪlˈmɛnt]
- hammering, pounding, the act of hitting something with a blunt implement;
- thud, thump, whack, knock, the sound made by a blunt collision;
- emphasis, accent, stress, focus, drawing attention to something particular

Etymology: noun derivation from martellar "hammer, pound; emphasise, accentuate", which itself comes from noun martel "hammer". This descends from Late Latin martellus "hammer", a variant diminutive of synoymous marculus in Classical Latin. This term developed its metaphorical senses in tandem with the verb, during the late Middle Borlish period.

179.3: çosc "stubby"

çosc /tsɔx/ [tsɔx]
- stubby, notably short and thick;
- shortened, docked, cut short, stunted, made shorter or prevented from growing longer;
- squat, stocky, (of a person) short and solidly built;
- thick, broad, relatively great in extent across its shortest solid dimension

Etymology: adjectival use of Old Borlish noun çosc "stump of a tree", which was a variant (likely borrowed from çoche in Old French) of native cognate çoc "stump". These descend from Vulgar Latin tsucca "stump, trunk", though to come via Gaulish from Classical German stuccas "stick, beam; stump". The word was replaced in its noun use by taisc "stump", possibly from Latin taxeus "made of yew wood".

179.4: indagour "sleuth"

indagour /ˌɪn.daˈgur/ [ˌɪn.dɐˈgʊː]
- investigator, detective, sleuth, a person employed to discover things that are unknown or hidden;
- tracker, tracer, a person or tool that keeps an eye on where someone or something is;
- analyser, scanner, any tool that extracts information from a source

Etymology: agentive derivation from verb indagar "track, investigate, scan, analyse", which is a sixteenth-century borrowing from Latin indāgō "I track, trace; I investigate". The word was used only for people until the late nineteenth century, when the word was extended to various devices able to autonomously track or analyse things.

180.2: ensign "suit"

ensign /ɛnˈsain/ [ɪnˈsain]
- emblem, logo, symbol, insignia, a distinguishing mark or design;
- token, badge, a physical object decorated with such a mark;
- designation, role, rank, honour, position, office, entitlement to privileges and responsibility for duties in some sort of hierarchy;
- (cards) suit, each of the sets of playing cards distinguished by a particular small symbol

Etymology: Middle Borlish, a semilearned borrowing from Latin insignia "emblem, badge", a noun formation from adjective insignis "marked, distinguished". The word has been used metonymically to refer to the position conferred or represented by an insignia since the fifteenth century, and it has been used in card games from approximately the same time.

180.3: vanaglous "jargony"

vanaglous /ˌva.nɛiˈluz/ [ˌva.nɪiˈluz]
- vernacular, vulgar, colloquial, slangy, basilectal, demotic, coming from informal speech as used in lower-class contexts;
- jargony, technical, filled with specialised or technical vocabulary;
- obscurantist, obfuscating, sesquipedalian, grandiloquent, difficult to comprehend due to overuse of complicated or rare verbiage

Etymology: nineteenth century, adjectival derivation from vanagl "cant, jargon, slang". This reflects Old Borlish vanagle "the Borlish language (as opposed to Latin)", which is thought to reflect Latin vernāculus "native, domestic". This comes from the root verna, which refers to a homeborn slave.

- higher, further, additional, advanced, (education) more difficult or complex and requiring some prerequisite;
- (colloquial) tricky, 4-D, clever, (with sarcastic force) requiring great intelligence and strategy especially applied to contexts that fully don't need cleverness

Etymology: eighteenth century, originally in universities to refer to subjects like Rhetoric Alçor "Higher Rhetoric"; a direct borrowing from Latin altior "higher". Eventually the word was applied to institutions as a whole, like the Schol Alçor de Nadacou "Nadacow Higher School". Its vernacular extension originates in student slang during the Good Game period.

180.5: 19th Century Novels

summaries of a few works of fiction set in the nineteenth century.

The Red Man (originally in Bulgar as Мaжaт вЧервено "The Man in Red") is a fright tale written by Petcov in 1830s Sreddies [Sofia] and set a decade earlier. This is the aftermath of the Second German War and the concomitant disintegration of the Kingdom of the Danaw [Danube]. The book features newly-independent Boxa [Novi Sad], the recovering shell of Stamboul [Istanbul], and many of the cities of the region which would eventually band together to form the so-called "Riverine Cities". The Red Man has heroes trying to decipher the mysterious figure known as Zechariah, a vampire; this work codified many of the tropes of the vampire, such as fire, blood and butterflies.

Rasgatto (originally in Zahid Russian as Разгадто "Unknotting") is a mystery romance of the 1870s written by Olexi Harchenko in Boxa. The work was sufficiently popular that its title was borrowed into Venise Italian to mean "resolution of a mystery" and later simply "dénouement"; subsequently the term made it into many European languages.

Flaxen Hearts (originally in Mostara as Querdos Llineros "Flaxen Hearts") is a 1919 sensation trevold [novel] in the nascent genre of social comedy popularised by the lovetales of Clarissa Bellamy and the adolescences of Dorotha Quistack, among others. The author Judeta Barracin wrote the work after returning from living for many years in the Arcabil [Caribbean]. It is set in the early nineteenth century and follows the petty dramas of a group of siblings in Cordova [Cordoba].

Earthly Scene (originally in Vascon as Vista Terrena "Landscape") is a trevold first published in 1809 by Antòin Herrel in the Vascon city of Santander. It was almost immediately banned on charges of obscenity, and only survived due to Herrel's flight to Portsmouth, where he published the word in Kentish under his new appellation Tony Smith (presumably aided in the translation by his companion Hal Brennan). The original manuscript was eventually published in 1870, some years after his death.

181.2: alligar "relate"

alligar /ˌa.liˈgar/ [ˌa.lɪˈgɐː]
- associate, relate, link, connect, to note resemblances or relevance of one thing to other things;
- compare, set against, juxtapose, to examine the similarities and differences between;
- match, correlate, to make the parts of two things or collections correspond

Etymology: Middle Borlish, borrowed from Latin alligō "I bind to, tie, fetter". Thus, this word is a doublet of inherited alleyar "ally, collaborate, partner". Formerly used for physical ties and links (as related ligar "bind, bandage" still is), but now restricted to abstract usage.

Ma comoscon l'oc alligar con melodram?

181.3: harneisar "exploit"

harneisar /ˌhar.niˈsar/ [ˌhɐː.nɪˈzɐː]
- equip, wield, take up, wear, to pick up and affix to one's grip or person somehow;
- exploit, use, make use of, utilise, to put to some employment to one's or another's advantage

Etymology: Middle Borlish verbal derivation from harneis "equipment, gear, tackle". This descends via Drengot French from Old Norrish hernest, a compound of herr "army" and nest "provisions". As such, the word was restricted to military contexts until the sixteenth century.

Nos harneisaum graivet e gant.

sgranfeyar /ˌsgran.fiˈjar/ [ˌzgʀaɱˈfjɐː]
- crunch, crush, to put pressure on and thus cause to make a diffuse noise of breaking;
- grind, pulverise, to reduce to small pieces with noise and often violence;
- munch, chew, chomp, to eat noisily

Etymology: seventeenth century, derived from the root gran "grain, seed" with the somewhat-pejorative prefix s- < Latin ex- "out" and the factitive suffix -feyar < Latin -ficō "I make". The word was first used to refer to eating a century after its first attestation.

181.5: Chronicles of Kilshaw

The Kilshaw writers' collective were a group of Merch authors who all lived in or around Kilshaw [Culcheth], a village in the northwestern part of Markland. The group was active through the middle decades of the twentieth century, and is remembered mainly for several long-running series of children's books. These, including the Joke Tawyer adventures, the Emma and Matt mysteries and the Samborn Sisters fancies, helped to redefine the landscape of children's publishing in Markland and beyond. The Kilshaw series have been translated into dozens of languages, and many have been adapted to formats such as sobot [radio] or phasm [television].

A brother and sister pair, Kenna and Holcroft Strong, began collaborating on stories in the early 1930s. They, along with author friends picked up in university and later from literary circles in Safford, would go on to form the Kilshaw collective.

Stories from Kilshaw made an industry of aping, parodying or homaging trends and fads in adult literature, telling tales in genres like masquira, social comedy or voidtale that happen to feature child protagonists. Originally played mostly for comic effect or as entertainment for parents, later works tended to take their premises more seriously and (especially in books aimed at older children) explored more realistic consequences of their events.

Kilshaw is one of the smaller settlements in the intercity borough of Makerfell [Makerfield], west of Safford [Salford]. Its variable pre-reform spellings (including Kilchath and Culshet) point to its etymology in British Celt terms cul "narrow" or cil "corner" and coed "woodland". This makes the placename a likely cognate of other toponyms like Colquiet in Devon and Culgod in Hasiny. The village has become a minor tourist destination for families or for the literary-minded, with a museum and regular fetes themed around Kilshaw characters (costumes, reenactments, etc).

182.2: broðoquin "gibberish"

broðoquin /ˌbro.ðoˈkwɪn/ [ˌbʀo.ðʊˈkwɪn]
- gibberish, gobbledegook, nonsense, babble, double Dutch, speech without meaning;
- bullshit, tosh, balderdash, poppycock, blatant falsehoods

Etymology: fourteenth century with various spellings, originally meaning "the language of non-Borlish speakers on Borland, especially of the northern Norse speakers". Both Norse and English languages had been spoken for several centuries on the north and west of the island, respectively. The word is presumed to be an adaptation of the Borland Norse phrase broð oc vin "bread and wine" (the alternative broðr oc ven "brother and friend" is considered less plausible).

Jo vay noc a l'ec broðoquin scoutar.

182.3: pat fair "fumble"

pat fair /pat fer/ [pat feː]
- fumble, paw, to handle with clumsy hands;
- bungle, botch, mishandle, to deal with (a situation) poorly;

Etymology: idiomatic phrase attested from the fifteenth century, literally "to do paws" in reference to the unsuitability of many animal's paws for holding things. The noun pat "paw; (colloq.) hand, foot" descends from Vulgar Latin patta "paw", a borrowing from Frankish related to English "pad". In metaphorical use the phrase is seen from the seventeenth century.

L'agathin a pat fait sad ag tourf.
/ˌla.gaˈθɪn a pat fet sad ɛi turf/
[ˌla.gɐˈθɪn a pat fet sad ɛi tʊːf]
df=minister have paw do-p.pst badly to.df riot
The minister mishandled the riot.

##

182.4: mensc "politeness"

mensc /mɛnx/ [mɛŋx]
- (obsolete) honour, dignity, the state of being worthy of esteem;
- (archaic) mercy, kindness, relenting from causing or forbearing to cause harm;
- (dated, poetic or jocular) politeness, etiquette, manners, courtesy, decorum, appropriate social behaviour

Usage note: nowadays principally in the idiom sy mensc eð y mansc tenir "have it both ways".

Etymology: from Old Borlish mensc "praiseworthiness, repute, fame". This was borrowed from Old Norrish mennska "humanity", a descendant of Classical German manniscas "human". The semantic shift via honourable actions to general good behaviour was complete by the seventeenth century. The modern phrase literally means "to keep one's manners and one's food", in reference to being a good host while not actually offering anything to eat. It is first attested in a book of proverbs by an anonymous author of the late eighteenth century.

Orruð i crey poðir sy mensc eð y mansc tenir.
/ɔˈrɪθ i kri poˈðɪr si mɛnx ɛθ i manx teˈnɪr/

182.5: Writing in the 1880s

notes on several works of writing published during the 1880s.

Pasti Mezziterreni is an 1880 mealbook which compiles recipes from around the Middlesea [Mediterranean]. It was authored by Josforo Sant'Angelo (or at least on his behalf), a traveller from Tuscany who had already garnered significant renown due to his travels, including a near-fatal circumnavigation. The book doubles as an itinerary of a continuous sunward journey along the Middlesea coast from Tarifa in Andalus to X̀r l Joas in Morrack [Ksar es-Seghir, Morocco]. Dozens of translations were published over the subsequent years, including a bilingual Kernish–Wessern [minority Welsh and English languages] version by Iscombe Editors in 1892.

Cludor ncar Vantel "A Postman in Wrexham" is an 1882 trevold parachthon trevold [SFF novel]. It chronicles the misadventures of the titular postman who becomes trapped experiencing the same week over and over. It is notable for being the origin of the Welsh phrase speid dolenu "time loop, lit. coiling timespan", which has been calqued into many other language (compare e.g. liesc bouclant in Borlish).

Dug y Gilfah Dowł "The Duke of Dark Corners" is an 1884 word of historical parachthony by Taguen ah Owain. Set in the twelfth century, she depicts a fictious tetrad of empires controlling Europe and the circum-Middlesea, ruled respectively from Damvath [Borland's capital], Florence, Tanger [Tangier] and Kiew [Kyiv].

L'Aragn "The Spider" is an 1887 play written by Borlish playwright Osctra Jeichey, which has had several touring productions and adaptations to film. The play is about a group of people manipulated by a genius mastermind whose plots eventually collapse in dramatic fashion. A notable version of the play is the 1930 New Provincial version La Rogna, a loose retelling which swapped the sex of many of the characters. The protagonist remained a woman, giving the film tovaric [gay] subtext rather unusual for New Provence at this time.

The first installments of Monstres per Mans "Man-Made Monsters" were published in 1888 by Carmel fi Domenc. This was a serial work of parachthon and fright fiction which would continue until 1903. The episodes appeared in the Santrafew [~Boston] periodical Arcans Exumaz "Revealed Mysteries", which Carmel fi Domenc also co-owned with her brother Jered.

Murro Mendeva "The Making of Mendeva" is a historical textbook which narrativises the early exploration and settlements by Vetomundine [Old World] groups in Mendeva [North America]. Written in 1888 by In mac Harlach, an Irish Welshman, it has been roundly criticised as an inaccurate and blinkered polemic against the concepts of alliance and integration with the original Mendevan peoples and nations. It reveals the influence of a resentful bloc in Britain which saw the rise of Hasiny as a threat.

183.2: teun "scant"

teun /taun/ [taun]
- scant, scanty, meagre, not in any great quantity;
- insufficient, paltry, not at all enough;
- rare, scarce, very uncommon;
- rarefied, thin, (of a gas) of low density

Etymology: via Old Borlish tiun, tieun "thin" from Latin tenuis "slight, weak". Thus, this word is one of the only pieces of evidence as to the development of post-stress /-w-/ (following a non-velar consonant) from Latin into Borlish. The semantic shift to senses relating to insufficiency is evidenced from the early Middle Borlish period.

L'oc aer es teun neðan nos respireu.
/lɔk ar ɛz taun neˈðan nɔz ˌrɛ.spiˈrau/
[lʊˈgɐː‿ʀɪz taun nɪˈðan nɔz ˌʀɛ.spɪˈʀau]

##

183.3: gaviscenç "festivities"

gaviscenç /ˌga.viˈxɛnts/ [ˌga.vɪˈçɛnts]
- festivities, celebration, gala, party, a social gathering for entertainment and fun;
- revelry, merrymaking, mafficking, frolic, the act of having fun at such an event

Etymology: sixteenth century, a noun formation from the verb gavir "rejoice, have fun". This descends from Latin gaudeō "I make merry". Originally the word often referred specifically to the celebration of religious holidays or feast days.

Vos vouð uncos special accommettr por y gaviscenç ou?
/vɔz vuθ ɪnˈkɔz speˈtsjal ˌa.kɔˈmɛtr̩ pɔr i ˌga.viˈxɛnts u/

183.4: nis tenir "be at fault"

nis tenir /nɪz teˈnɪr/ [nɪz tɪˈnɪː]
- be responsible, take responsibility, to be the ultimate cause of something;
- be at fault, be liable, take the blame, to have something bad attributed to one;
- more generally, to be the origin or driving force behind something

Etymology: idiom from the seventeenth century, originally seen in legal contexts, literally "to hold effort". The noun nis "effort, vigour; force; obligation; attention" comes from Old Boral nis, neȝs, niȝs et al. "effort, vigour", which descends uncomplicatedly from Latin nīxus, nīsus "strain, forward momentum". This is the participle of deponent verb nītor "I lean on, advance, strive, contend".

Cu tendra nis ac?
/ki tɛnˈdra nɪz ak/
[ki tɪnˈdʀa nɪz ak]
who hold-fut effort here
Whose fault is it?

183.5: Defining the Dime

excerpt from the work Pa's Hyd Raf? "How Long is a Piece of String?", written in 2026 as a series of freely available posts on the mesh by Łew ab Ennis, which delves into the history of the development of systems of weights and measures.

…originally defined the "second" simply as the eight-and-sixty-four hundredth part of the mean solar day, but by the end of the nineteenth century it had been observed that this period would vary by as much as a few hundred scant (10⁻⁸). In search of a stabler value, the Secular Second Undertaking set several astronomical groups worldwide to record the precise length of the tropical year from the summer solstice of 1900 until that of 1901, and defined the "(secular) second" to be the 3155,6926th part of this timespan.

While time has always had a single fundamental base in the dime measure system, other quantities are less simple. The dime principle that all quantities should be related by factors of ten did not prevent a proliferation of standards. Length has four basic units in common usage: a league is a hundred chains, a chain a hundred feet, a foot ten inches. Units of area and volume are defined by squares and cubes of the base lengths. For example, the farthing (formerly defined as one quarter of an acre) is equal to a square chain.

In the first decades of the twentieth century, the foot was still officially defined as the length of a particular rod of iron-baxon [nickel] alloy kept in Tammombay [Mumbai]. In 1946 the foot was redefined in terms of the second, so that the normal speed œ [lightspeed] would be precisely 10,0000,0000 feet per second. This locked the precision of the foot to that of the second. Subsequent refinements have primarily come in the form of particular sources of light, whose spans [wavelengths] or equivalently cadences [frequencies] can be pinpointed extremely accurately.

The basic units of heft [mass] in the dime measures—the scruple, ounce, tabre and ton—were originally defined in terms of the density of water. To wit, the ounce was set as the mass of a cube of distilled water of side length one (dime) inch; this was later refined to specify that the water should be at its threshold point [triple point]. In practice, due to the difficulty of operationalising the water-based definition to more than a hundred-scant precision, by the 1920s the tabre (100 ounces) was fixed to a particular joracker [platinum] alloy puck weighing a tabre (one hundred ounces)…

===

Real-life comparisons:
1 dime second ~= 1 second - 0.84 nanoseconds

1 dime foot ~= 29.98 centimetres, 0.9836 feet

1 farthing ~= 0.08988 hectares, 0.2221 acres

1 dime ounce ~= 26.94 grams, 0.9502 ounces

1 tabre ~= 2.694 kilograms, 5.939 pounds

In part this can be attributed to the newness of an autochthonous élite west of the Atlantic, but mostly this is simply due to faster ships and greatly-reduced travel times.

##

184.2: veðrdon "prize"

veðrdon /ˌvɛð.r̩ˈdɔn/ [ˌvɛ.ðɐˈdɔn]
- prize, award, honour, a reward striven for in a competition or which may be won by chance;
- trophy, cup, an object (often a statuette or vessel) commemorating one's victory in a competition;

Etymology: the descendant of Old Borlish veðerdon "payment, reward", which comes from synonymous widerdōnum in Medieval Latin. This is a borrowing from Germanic (cf. Old English wiþerlēan "recompense", literally "counter-reward"), which the second part calqued as Latin dōnum "gift". Compare the Old French cognate guerredon "payment; spoils, booty, loot", whose first element was also adjusted to guerre "war". Conflation with unrelated Borlish veðr < Latin vitrum "glass" may have influenced the traditional concept of a trophy as made of glass or crystal.

I tenoy sy veðrdon n'oc ort e soureyeu.
/i teˈnɔj si ˌvɛð.r̩ˈdɔn nɔk ɔrt e ˌsu.riˈjau/

184.3: adolescenç "bildungsroman"

adolescenç /ˌa.do.leˈxɛnts/ [ˌa.dʊ.lɪˈçɛns]
- adolescence, teenagerhood, the period of life between childhood and adulthood;
- coming of age, maturation, the process or event of becoming an adult;
- sweet sixteen, quinceañera, bat/bar mitzvah (etc.), any of several customary ceremonies performed in various cultures to mark a person coming of age;
- bildungsroman, coming-of-age story, a genre of tales about the growth (in several senses) of characters from children to adults

Etymology: Middle Borlish, a borrowing from Scholastic Latin adolēscentia "maturation, growing up", nominal derivative of Classical verb adolēscō "I grow up, become an adult". In the meaning of a type of tradition, the word is a clipping of former phrase rit d'adolescenç "coming-of-age rite". The term was first used for the literary genre in the early 20C to describe the works of London author Dorotha Quistack.

Cay un adolescenç a them d'alumn ne Tecamau.

184.4: dom "dome"

dom /dɔm/ [dɔm]
- dome, cupola, the architectural feature of a hollow upper half-sphere on the roof of a building;
- (mathematics) hemisphere, the surface of half a sphere;
- pate, crown, the top of the head (especially when hairless)

Etymology: originally in the first sense, from Middle Borlish dom "dome; stately building, edifice" (now obsolete in the latter senses). This comes from the conflation of Italian duomo "cathedral", from Latin domus ecclēsiae​ "meeting-house, church", with French dosme "dome", which comes via Late Latin dōma "roof" from Greek δῶμᾰ "house, housetop". The merger, which had likely already occurred in Middle French before the term entered Borlish, was aided by the prominence of domes on Italian cathedrals.

Com s'augrim y stent a starn d'un dom lonc sy ray?
/kɔm soˈgrɪm i stɛnt a starn d'ɪn dɔm lɔnk si re/

184.5: A Worldwide Web

various features of the Boralverse beginning with W.

War without Walls is a textbook of military history by Ajamarn [~Rajasthani] scholar Indvar Vijarrania, written in the early twentieth century during his tenure at the University of Udjén [Ujjain]. He chronicles the development of military strategy in the wake of the advent of cannon and other explosives, and in particular how these technologies obsoleted the formerly dominant strategy of defence via walled fortifications.

Wessern (Merch /ˈwɛ.sɐn/, Wessern Wesseron /wəsˈsɛɾən/, Welsh Sasneg /sɐˈznɛg/, Borlish Wessaxon /ˌvɛ.sakˈsɔn/) is the language of the English minority living in Britain [~Wales, etc], primarily in eastern Devon and the downstream Severn. It is the third-most spoken English language on Albion [Great Britain], after Merch and Kentish, although it also has significant populations of speakers abroad in British Mendeva [NA] and elsewhere. Wessern features geminate consonants and the simplification of coda clusters (compare Merch dark /daːk/ to Wessern darick /ˈda.ɾək/ "dark"), as well as fricative voicing between vowels and at the start of words.

Winchester Scholastic Primers are a publishing company which have operated in Kent since the early twentieth century. They have produced works principally of academic or educational interest, with several works used regularly in schools. Books from this publishing house include:
- The Alphabetical Albion (1920), by a consortium including Lucas Osborne
- A Comprehensive Cyclopædia of Pre-Fracture Europe (1937), written by Martin and Elisabeth Forman and illustrated by Goffrey Jordan
- In Sickness and in Health: Medicine in pre-Arnoutszen Europe (2nd ed. 1961), by Andrew Knowles with foreword by Dr Laura Norris

Wolfston the Younger (fl. ca. 930 N) was the last English king of Northumber before the rump state was folded into the Dane territory ruled from Yorwick [York]. Northumber had controlled lands as far south as Yorwick until the ninth century, when that city became the first major settlement in England conquered during the Dane Supremacy. According to the Carlile chronicle, Wolfston's short reign ended ignominiously and without issue at the fortifications in Edinbrough, when those too were captured by Dane forces.

185.2: pestriçon "formation"

pestriçon /ˌpɛ.striˈtsɔn/ [ˌpɛ.stʀɪˈtsɔn]
- formation, development, emergence, creation, genesis, the process during which something comes into being;
- assembly, arrangement, shape, form, configuration, structure, layout, the manner in which something is physically composed in space

Etymology: early Modern Borlish, a noun derivation from verb pestrir "knead; mould, form, shape". This is a direct descendant from Vulgar Latin pistriō "I knead", from Classical Latin pistor "baker, miller". Initially referring to the act of kneading dough or moulding clay, the word took on more general senses almost at once.

185.3: a cascun "respectively"

a cascun /a kaˈxɪn/ [a kɐˈçɪn]
- each, apiece, (e.g. of a price) for an individual item from a set;
- per head, per capita, (of a statistic) divided by the population of the region in question;
- respectively, corresponding in the order given when comparing two lists of things;
- pointwise, (in mathematics) occuring or true independently for each point in a set

Etymology: literally "to each one", in idiomatic use attested from the twelfth century. The pronoun cascun "each one" descends directly from Vulgar Latin cascūnum "each one", a conflation of Classical quisque ūnum and Late Latin cata ūnum "each one". The phrase's use extended beyond financial and census-taking contexts through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

185.4: bastegl "bulwark"

bastegl /baˈstɪjl/ [baˈstɪjl]
- fortress, fortification, a strongly built and defended military structure or enclosure used in warfare;
- bastion, stronghold, a secure position or place of power and influence;
- bulwark, defence, something that serves as a shield or protection against danger or attack;
- safeguard, protection, precaution, any means of preventing harm or ensuring safety

Etymology: a borrowing from Middle French bastille "fortress", itself from early Doccian [Occitan] bastida "fortress, edifice" adapted to the -ille suffix < Latin īle "enclosure". This comes from Late Latin bastiō "I build; I sew", a borrowing from Frankish. In metaphorical usage the word is in evidence from the eighteenth century.

185.5: England

notes on the geographical region of England.

England (Merch /ˈɛn.glənd/, Norman Engleterre /ˈɛ̃ng.tɛʀ/, Welsh Łoegr /ˈɬoː.gə/, Borlish Larry /laˈʀi/) is the name of a loosely demarcated region of Albion [Great Britain]. In the modern day England may be defined politically to be the territory of Northumber, Markland, London and (Albic) Kent; it may also be defined linguistically to be the part of Albion inhabited by communities of speakers of English languages. The latter definition is more expansive, due to the many Wessern speakers in eastern Devon and Merch speakers in eastern Wales.

The majority of languages not listed above refer to this region by some borrowing or adaptation of Medieval Latin Anglōnia "England". This was formed by analogy to e.g. Saxōnia "Saxony" from the root Anglī "Angles", one of the German peoples who populated the region in the sub-Roman and early medieval period. The exceptional Welsh and Borlish toponyms are presumably cognate (see Old Borlish variant form Laȝr "Englishman"), reflecting a hypothesised Classical Kelt word laecor "warriors".

There are (according to mainstream analysis) four English languages spoken on Albion; in order of number of speakers these are Northumber, Wessern, Kentish and Merch. The polity of Northumber extends from the Humber to Edinbrough along the eastern side of Albion, but its local tongue, which has more Norse influence than other Englishes, competes for use there with the more prestigious Merch. Wessern is predominantly spoken in Britain [Wales, Devon, etc], where it enjoys co-official status in some tallaths [~provinces] but a decidedly subordinate role. Wessern features geminate consonants and the simplification of coda clusters (compare Merch dark /daːk/ to Wessern darick /ˈda.ɾək/ "dark"), as well as fricative voicing between vowels and at the start of words.

Kentish is one of the two languages of Kent along with Norman. Kent is a polity divided by the Kentish Channel [English Channel], both geographically and linguistically. Nonetheless, Kentish has had much more French influence over the past millennium than other Englishes, which continues to this day. For example, Kentish is the only English language within the so-called "roral ambit", having a uvular rhotic.

Merch is by some way the most-spoken English language, official both in Markland and London. The London standard of the language, while fully mutually intelligible with the Markland form (to a much greater degree than between different English languages), has several differences, notably in spelling—London did not particpate in the 1870 reforms which somewhat rationalised Merch orthography.

186.1: Global Workshop

notes in translation on the subject of the Global Workshop period.

L'epoc dell'Atelier, ben l'Atelier Mondial, interman y dezein entrpos dy siecr novoç.
The Workshop period, or the Global Workshop, refers to the middle decades of the nineteenth century.

L'oc se descrey par y spanjon e defasment veloç de laboriostur atras dy mont.
It is characterised by the rapid expansion and development of industry across the world.

The impact of the Workshop period can be seen in artistic trends, with the shift away from voidtales and towards (on the one hand) realistic portrayals of the industrial working class and (on the other) optimistic speculation on future material advancements.

186.2: excellent "conspicuous"

excellent /ˌɛk.tsɛˈlɛnt/ [ˌɛk.sɪˈlɛnt]
- preeminent, superior, leading, distinguished, held in particularly high regard;
- noteworthy, famous, renowned, widely known or celebrated for something or somebody's qualities or deeds;
- noticeable, conspicuous, standing out, blatant, remarkable or evident to the senses or the mind

Etymology: Middle Borlish borrowing from Latin excellēns "surpassing, eminent", the present participle of verb excellō "I rise, project, excel". The extension of the word both to general noteworthiness and to obviousness had occurred by the eighteenth century.

I porta un min de derijon excellent.
/i pɔrˈta ɪn mɪn de ˌde.riˈʒɔn ˌɛk.tsɛˈlɛnt/

186.3: progentar "beget"

progentar /ˌpro.ʒɛnˈtar/ [ˌpʀo.ʝɪnˈtɐː]
- (archaic) beget, sire, father, mother, to be the parent of;
- originate, give rise to, create, invent, devise, to cause to come into existence;
- inspire, provoke, engender, to cause to occur or to be felt;

Etymology: the verb is an early modern backformation of older progentour "creator", a borrowing from Latin prōgenitor "ancestor". This is an agent noun derivation from verb prōgignō "I beget, produce". In metaphorical use for causing actions or feelings the word is seen from the early nineteenth century.

Hasiny progentau magn orðenjanç sobottal.

186.4: y sona hurstar "take one's place"

y sona hurstar /i soˈna hɪrˈstar/ [i sʊˈna hɪːˈstɐː]
- take one's place, make it, to attain a position that one is supposed or destined to reach;
- step up, rise to the occasion, to assume some responsibility;
- come into one's own, flourish, thrive, to begin to do well in a newly cquired role

Etymology: idiom from the nineteenth century, literally "to equip the role". The noun sona "role" derives from thespian slang in the early modern period, a clipping of Latin persōna "mask; character, part, role". The verb descends from Old Borlish hurstar "decorate, adorn", a borrowing from synonymous hyrstan in Old English (compare Merch hirstend "superfluous").

Y joun a y sona fort hurstað cos nuverrem.
/i ʒun a i soˈna fɔrt hɪrˈstaθ kɔz niˈvɛ.rɛm/

186.5: False Friends (cont. 2)

some more completely arbitrary dictionary entries from the Concise Onomatory o'Merch (fifth edition), a reference work published in 1961 and compiled by the Utcheter Lexical Association.

Awry [/ˈəu.ɾi/ "Hungary"] n.pr. a polity of Europe inhabited principally by the Majoric people, located east of Crain and Crovatia and west of Halich and Vallack. 10C Old English, allied with contemporary French Avrie, Saxon Aweri, Bavarn Awaren < Medieval Latin Avaria "the Avar Empire". This early medieval empire was erroneously conflated in Latin sources with (or perhaps merely repurposed as a geographical term for) the subsequent Majoric principality after their conquest of the region in the ninth century.

boss [/bɔs/ "gun"] n. a handheld weapon which fires a bullet using some explosive substance. 16C < Willem Dutch bósz, armbósz "boss" < early Dutch armbaust "crossbow" < Old French arbaleste < later Latin arcuballista "crossbow".

guy-coney [/ˈgəiˌkʊ.ni/ "guinea pig"] n. (also guy) a small, tail-less glire of Cappatia [South America] raised for meat or as a hearth animal. 17C, a borrowing in sense from Vascon conill guy (the second element altered in pronunciation to match the name) < 16C Morrove Arabic قنية قُوِي • (qnia qui) < Run'allo [Quechua] qowi "(female) guy-coney". For the coney element: 12C early Merch < reformed singular of Norman plural conis "coneys" of conil < Latin cunīculus "coney; burrow, warren; mine".

sicker [/ˈsɪ.kə/ "certain"] adj. free of any doubt or possibility of being incorrect; confident of one's correctness. Direct descendant of Old English sicor "safe, certain" < western Classical German sicur < Latin sēcūrus "unconcerned; fearless; safe".

187.1: Stopping Scurvy

By the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, with the much longer geoscopic voyages following the Novomundine Landfall of 1471, efforts to prevent scurvy became more active.

For example, King Ambrose III of Vascony (the "Ascendant") instituted the Sandrine Design in 1485 by which ships would be required to stock dried fruits and syrups.

However, such schemes did not have lasting effects.

Cos parçal l'oc se deye a careç ma magn moulosessem, ag defait de comprenjon cas y method comoscon fruit poðen scurvog coïr.
This was partly due to expense but much more significantly, due to the lack of understanding of the mechanism by which fruit prevented scurvy.

Thus, fruit would be preserved in ways which removed their sandrine content (for example, boiling or use of copper vessels) and sailors would suffer scurvy anyway, leading guilds to abandon stocking fruits altogether.

187.2: feurðon "decare"

feurðon /faurˈðɔn/ [ˌfa.wɐˈðɔn]
- rood, vergée, a traditional unit of land area equal to one quarter of an acre;
- decare, a modern metric unit of land area defined as ten thousand square feet

Etymology: originally in the first sense, part of the traditional system of area measures used on Borland along with the acr "acre" (also called the jur in the east). The word reflects Old Borlish feorðon, forðin "rood", from Old English féorðing or Old Norrish [Norse] fiórðungr "quarter, fourth part". The word was redefined in the nineteenth century with the adoption of dime [metric] units, being the numerically closest measure available (compare the Turk دونوم • dönüm or the Nivoner [Japanese] たんぶ • tambu, units which were similarly adjusted to this new dime measure).

Y majon terraun set nell'oc feurðon.

187.3: yauvnar "pat"

yauvnar /jovˈnar/ [ʝʊvˈnɐː/
- pat, to gently tap the flat of one's hand against;
- tamp down, flatten, to hit or push against from above to make smooth or flat;
- unruffle, smooth out, to remove the bumpiness from by e.g. stretching out;

Etymology: originally in the latter senses, descendant of Old Borlish iawnar "to smooth, even, flatten". This is a borrowing from Old Norrish [Norse] jafna "to make even", a verbal derivative of jafn "even; equal, same". Specialisation to the act of tapping the flat of one's hand against something is seen from the fifteenth century.

I s'yauvnau y cavel sborreyað cos van.

187.4: skillet "chip"

skillet /skɪˈlɛt/ [skɪˈlɛt]
- chip, fragment, shard, piece, a small part broken off a larger whole;
- splinter, sliver, a long and sharp fragment of a material such as wood;
- chip, fry, a fried strip of potato or similar food

Etymology: early modern Borlish, apparently from Kernish askleut or Devoner skylot "chips, shavings, splinters". These both descend from Classical British asclod "splinter", a borrowing from Late Latin ascla which itself is a variant of Classical assula "splinter". The word was first applied to foods in the seventeenth century and had specialised to starches like potatoes by the nineteenth.

Y pescot e skillet n'Ausçagm son ragostant.
/i peˈxɔt e skɪˈlɛt noˈsɛjm sɔn ˌra.gɔˈstant/

187.5: The Void

notes on three things which are somehow related to outer space.

The Superdraconic Apocalypse (Borlish Apocalyps Surdraconic /aˌpo.kaˈlɪps sɪrˌdra.koˈnɪk/) refers to the fall of a cisjovial sax [asteroid from the asteroid belt] approximately sixty-six hundred myriad years ago, probably during the northern spring. It was followed by the eradication of roughly three-quarters of all animal species, including all dragons [dinosaurs] bar the ancestors of modern birds. The name of this event, coined in the nineteenth century as a hypothetical (several decades before evidence of the impact was actually discovered) to explain the extinction in the fossil record, refers to its location—temporally at the end of, and therefore geologically on top of, the Draconic Age (2.5–0.66 great myriad years ago).

The waveform display [Fourier transform] (Borlish despley ondatim /dɛˈspli ˌɔn.daˈtɪm/) is the presentation of a mathematical function as the sum of vatre and arrhumb [sine and cosine] functions. This technique was developed in the eighteenth century as a way to help compute celestial orbits, in part by Barcelon mathematician Raymond al Mustafa.

The Auroric Anomaly of 1859 (Borlish Anomaly Auroric /aˌno.maˈli ˌo.roˈrɪk/) was a collection of phenomena associated with an intense sunstorm, including auroras and—most famously—malfunctioning barrick steeplepost [electric telegraph] equipment. Various operators reported sparks, fires, and even being able to sporadically use wires to transmit when they weren't powered. The first tachygraph [typewriter] capable of sending messages on the steeplemesh was tested by Tomas Vilmanas on Michael's Day, less than a month after the Anomaly. However, despite later dramatisation, there is little evidence that the two events are connected.

188.2: bechettar "dig in"

bechettar /ˌbe.kɛˈtar/ [ˌbe.kɪˈtɐː]
- dig in, chow down, tuck in, to begin eating;
- munch, nosh, to eat vigorously or noisily;
- get stuck in, engage, to become enthusiastically involved in an activity

Etymology: nineteenth century verbal derivative of the noun bec "beak, snout, muzzle; (colloquial, of people) mouth". This descends directly from Latin beccus "beak, bill", a borrowing from Gaulish. In metaphorical usage the word is seen from the early twentieth century.

Nos bechettaum jug posc l'elocquy.

188.3: mormonnar "mumble"

mormonnar /ˌmɔr.mɔˈnar/ [ˌmɔː.mʊˈnɐː]
- mumble, mutter, murmur, to say quietly and indistinctly;
- burble, babble, gurgle, to make the speech-like sounds of an infant;
- glug, flow, trickle, bubble, to make the sound of noisily flowing water

Etymology: late Middle Borlish, an onomatopoetic formation (along with contemporaneous mormonment "(a) mumble") allied with Latin murmurō "I murmur" and Parisian marmotter "to mutter". The word had extended to similar non-speech sounds by the end of the eighteenth century.

Y çarf bondisceu tras un reu mormonnant.

188.4: sborreyar "dishevel"

sborreyar /ˌsbɔ.riˈjar/ [ˌzbɔ.ʀɪˈʝɐː]
- dishevel, tousle, ruffle, to render (hair, clothes, etc.) untidy or disordered;
- disarray, disorganise, to throw into chaos more generally;
- tangle, entangle, knot, snarl, mat, to mix up (e.g. strands) so that they cannot be easily separated (also metaphorically);
- shuffle, to change the arrangement of (in the manner of cards or other game pieces)

Etymology: early modern Borlish, borrowed from northern dialect. The word is a verbal derivative of rural term borr "tuft, burr, clump", which descends from Latin burra "ragged garment, coarse fragment". The prefix s- < Latin ex- is somewhat pejorative; the verbal ending comes from -idiō in Vulgar Latin.

188.5: The Second Millennium

notes on various names ordered chronologically.

Damian VI "the Wise" (r. 1199–1208; Damianus Sagāx) was a Pope in Rome during the tail end of the period known as the Medieval Imperia or the Second Tetrarchy. He was the first Roman Pope elected from the membership of the Brethin religious order, a Kelt monastic organisation dedicated among other things to record-keeping. Like others of his papal name, he honoured the twin saints Cosmas and Damian, third-century martyrs. Damain VI is remembered well, mostly in comparison to his successor Pope Just's numerous catastrophes.

The San Tomé (Portingale /sãw tuˈmɛ/ "Saint Thomas") was a myton [a type of merchant ship] of the Vascon trade fleet; as with many such ships, it was nominally the personal property of one of the powerful Vask noble families enirched by Atlantic fishing. Logs of its voyages have by happenstance been well-preserved. During one of its regular routes, from Cale [Oporto] to Damvath in September of 1492, the log records being unable to make port at Bournemouth due to battle in the city and harbour (part of the Wars of Fealty).

Gudmund and Rebecca Scradder (fl. 1677) were a married couple of Dane astronomers. In the 1670s they undertook a voyage to Seldiva [Sri Lanka] as part of a global scientific effort to observe a predicted transit of Mercury. Their observations helped to compute the mean distance from the Earth to the Sun.

Cadogan Torrior (fl. 1890) was an author from Nadacow [a city on the banks of the lower Mississippi] in Hasiny. Of relatively minor account during his life, his works of masquira like the 1890 trevold Men of Jet and Diamond have attained greater popularity through the mid-twentieth century. This was thanks to successful film adaptations, such as the New Provincial 1950 production Blanc Sabaje "Jet White".

189.1: Disappearance of the Redstone Chair

notes in translation on the subject of the Redstone Chair, containing the (alleged) block upon which the Elved Marriage between a princess of Markland and the ruler of Dane Northumber was solemnised.

189.2: greim "lap"

greim /grim/ [gʀim]
- lap, the upper legs of a seated person;
- skirt, apron, the part of a garment that covers this part of the body;
- bosom, embrace, affection, care, the figurative position of being nurtured or protected by someone

Etymology: direct descendant via Old Borlish from Latin gremium "lap; bosom; embrace". The term has been used in tailoring from the thirteenth century. The metaphorical sense may continue the similar usage in Latin, but is more likely to be an independent innovation of the early modern period.

Y cociner le tirau des un cromn de greim.

189.3: lasdr "pathetic"

lasdr /ˈlaz.dr̩/ [ˈla.zdɐ]
- (archaic) leprous, infected with one of the diseases known as leprosy;
- pitiable, pitiful, pathetic, wretched, arousing feelings of sympathy or pathos;
- contemptible, despicable, deplorable, arousing feelings of scorn or disdain;
- ineffectual, impotent, occurring to little useful effect

Etymology: Middle Borlish borrowing from contemporary French lasdre "n. leper, wretch; adj. leprous, wretched". This descends from Late Latin Lazarus, in reference to a beggar in the New Testamement who was traditionally understood to have been a leper.

Caye gimmolt lasdr a y smoutour ðescar.

189.4: movaç "pout"

movaç /moˈvats/ [mʊˈvats]
- pout, moue, an expression of displeasure via protruding lips;
- pet, brood, sulk, huff, mood, a fit of sullenness as characterised by pouting

Etymology: eighteenth century, pejorative noun formation from movar "pout, sulk". This reflects earlier moar, a borrowing from Old French verb moer and noun moe "grimace", each from a Frankish form reflecting Classical German mauvō "sleeve; protruding lip".

Sy figl reloy sur y hayennaç con un movaç.

189.5: The Three Rs

notes on three features of this alternate history setting which begin with the letter R.

Radulf "the Kite" (Borlish Radolf y Buttr /raˈdɔlf i ˈbɪt.r̩/, r. 951–) was the last English king of the rump Northumber, ruling from the castle at Edinbrough. He was wed to a woman referred to in the chronicles as one Atre of Cheswic, who may have been a daughter of King Roderick of Dunclothe [Strathclyde, Cumbria]. His reign ended with the expansion of Dane lands up and across from Yorwick [York]; by the turn of the millennium the entirety of the Neck was under Dane authority.

Ricardo Ivarrachezurí (fl. 1824) was a farm theorist from Vascony [SW France, N Spain], who fought as a mozardisto during the Second German War. Ivarrachezurí was the first theorist to record the ability of copper to kill sperm, noting in 1824 that “the seed of the bull, the ram and the stallion alike are made impotent in storing them for some hours in a syringe of copper”. He recognised that this was the same mechanism by which copper prevented infections. Although this sterilising property of copper would later be productively used in contraceptives, Ivarrachezurí treated it as a problem for farmers attempting to artificially breed livestock.

The Runeplate Body (Borlish Corp a Runment /kɔrp a rɪnˈmɛnt/) is a charitable organisation with multinational funding, headquartered in the Kiewan city of Lengrod [Lviv, Ukraine]. Its stated purpose is to compile information on all the writing systems of the world and to recommend standard encodings of glyphs for use on e.g. grimmers [computers]. The organisation, formally established in 1942, grew out of several small groups interested in writing systems, either on an amateurish basis or affiliated with various higher education establishments. The word "runeplate" originally referred to a sheet of metal into which the shapes of writing have been etched.

190.2: barrougl "wheelbarrow"

barrougl /baˈrujl/ [bɐˈʀʊjl]
- wheelbarrow, handcart, a small one-wheeled cart with handles used for transporting small loads;
- trolley, cart, a conveyance for carrying groceries or other items around a shop;
- buggy, pram, stroller, a small carriage in which an infant or toddler sits or lies and is pushed around

Etymology: via Old Borlish beroȝl "handcart, trolley" from synonymous birocla in Vulgar Latin. This reflects birotula, a diminutive from late Latin birota "two-wheeled cart" which comes from bi- "double" and rota "wheel". Compare Tuscan baroccio and Old French beroue, brouette, both meaning "cart". The term was likely influenced by the unrelated Old English bearwe "basket, handcart". In more general use the term is comparatively recent, only seen from the late ninteenth century.

I sta quemant com babe ne barrougl.

190.3: ðejar "tuck"

ðejar /ðeˈʒar/ [ðɪˈʝɐː]
- tuck, insert, fit, wedge, stick, lodge, to push into a confined or secure position;
- to place underneath something else;
- ram, shove, to drive with some force;
- compact, compress, to cause to be in a more convenient shape or configuration;
- (reflexive) fold up, curl up, to bend onself and hold onto one's legs; 
- (reflexive) fit, be neat, to be suited to taking up some particular space

Etymology: disputed. The word is often presumed to be a metathetic reflex of Old Borlish (a)ieðar [(a)dʒiˈðar] "ram, drive, push forward". This descends from Latin arietō "strike, batter", a verbal derivative from ariēs "ram; battering ram". However, this verb is last attested over two centuries before the first evidence of ðejar in the Middle Borlish period.

The alternative with the most backing is that the word reflects Latin adiciō "I throw at; I attach, augment", which has semantic and phonetic plausibility, although no intermediate forms are in evidence. Other suggestions, like a first-conjugation variant of Latin adigō "I drive, hurl, compel" or a Norrish [Norse] verb like þjá "force" or þeisa "thrust, rush", have rarely been credited.

Jo ðejau y pie neðan y port closisceus.

190.4: lan "wool"

lan /lan/ [lan]
- wool, the hair of sheep or other animals which is shorn to make clothing;
- curls, human hair which is notably curly;
- stuff, paraphernalia, junk, gear, undifferentiated possessions or objects in general;
- waffle, blather, meaningless or indecipherable speech or writing

Etymology: uncomplicated descendant of Latin lāna "wool". For human hair the word is attested sporadically from early Middle Borlish, with a resurgence in the twentieth century. The generic senses appear to descend from an obsolete slang use of the word to mean "cash, coins", which was briefly current in the early modern period.

Y barvier portan lan des lorrell'ovegl meðes.
/i barˈvjɛr pɔrˈtan lan dɛz lɔˌrɛ.loˈvijl meˈðɛz/

191.1: The Vanilla Manoeuvre

excerpt in translation from the 1992 trevold The Vanilla Manoeuvre (originally published in Merch under the title Tashban Tacks), written by Vendetta Boon, the granddaughter of Lord Runcibal Sawyer Boon, one-time Minster for Consequences in the Drengot Collusion. Of middling success, this spycraft work owes more to the film adaptations of the classics of the genre than to those classics themselves.

Y contris alandau n'un descovannet mejoncr, fait impacent sdruçollar tras y tabr.

191.2: gentagl "riffraff"

gentagl /ʒɛnˈtɛjl/ [ʝɪnˈtɛjl]
- populace, population, inhabitants, demos, the people of a region (especially of a nation or polity);
- masses, rabble, riffraff, hoi polloi, the common people as opposed to the elite (often with pejorative affect)

Etymology: Middle Borlish derivative of gent "people, nation" and -agl, an unproductive instrumental or collective suffix. The noun descends straightforwardly from Latin gēns "clan, tribe, people"; the affix from Latin thematic vowel -ā- and suffix -cula "tool, instrument". Attestatations of gentācula (with a first-declension variant of the suffix) "common people" in Scholastic Latin are likely modelled after the vernacular Romance forms.

191.3: entrlaçour "hustler"

entrlaçour /ˌɛnt.r̩.laˈtsur/ [ˌɛn.tɐ.lɐˈtsʊː]
- wheeler-dealer, hustler, schemer, a shrewd or unscrupulous operator in politics or commerce;
- swindler, sharpster, grifter, con artist, racketeer, someone running scams;
- pedlar, huckster, a small-time or itinerant merchant of (usually poor-quality) goods

Etymology: nineteenth century, borrowed (probably via intermedaries) from Sicilia ntrlazzaturi "swindler, racketeer". This is an agentive derivation from the noun ntrlazzu "scam, racket", which reflects Latin inter- "between" and laqueus "noose". Specialisation to politics probably occurred before the word entered Borlish, although there was no shortage of corruption in contempory governance on Borland to inspire the shift.

Jo broiðau l'entrlaçour coll'outrley.
/ʒo brɔjˈðo ˌlɛnt.r̩.laˈtsur i ˌlut.r̩ˈli/

191.4: hoðic "reeve"

hoðic /hoˈðɪk/ [hʊˈðɪk]
- reeve, headman, official, village leader, a person with authority in a small community;
- chief, chieftain, the leader of a clan or tribe;
- councillor, alderman, a member of a local governmental body

Etymology: descendant of Old Borlish houðic, hoðinc "village leader; esp. leader of a Norse settlement in the north of Borland". This is a borrowing from Old Norse hǫfðingi "chief, lord", which is a derivation of hǫfuð "head". The term was first used for elected positions in town or city councils in the fifteenth century.

Y bourg deleu l'oc hoðic ne souc d'un courstray.

191.5: Blue Trans-Willem War

The Blue Trans-Willem War (Willem: Blaw Trans-Willemsk Órlog, Borlish: Var Tras-Willem Blau) was one of a series of wars in the early modern period which principally involved French and Dutch [German] polities (that is, those powers located on either side of the territory of Willemy [~Benelux, Lorraine]) and which were de facto waged over control of said territory.

Though the sporadic flare-ups of hostilies are difficult to divide into discrete wars without some arbitrariness, modern historiography usually works with the chromatic periodisation of nineteenth-century writer Andrysk de Santer. Her system, based either (depending on the account) on the colours of the victors' standards or on alchemical symbolism, has the Blue war as the penultimate conflict, ending in the late seventeenth century. Some historians, though not de Santer, have classified the Blue war as part of the broader collection of Romantic Wars of the mid-seventeenth century.

As a coup de grâce following a series of smaller humiliations in earlier decades, the kingdom of Burgundy was formally dissolved after the Blue Trans-Willem War, with its territory partitioned between Provence and the kingdoms of France and Bavarn. For example, the duchy of Far Suebia was created as a vassal of Bavarn as a gift from King Frederick to the margrave Thorsten Villingen; the former Burgund capital of Geneva became a subordinate city in this new realm.

The duchy of Avosche and its seat at Axton [Aachen], which after a stable sixteenth century as a French vassal had changed hands five times in recent decades, was returned to French control as part of French Guillenne in the aftermath of the Blue Trans-Willem War.

192.2: oðig "especially"

oðig /oˈðaj/ [ʊˈðaj]
- (literary) especially, particularly, to a greater extent than is usual;
- to wit, i.e., viz., namely, that is, expressed in other words;
- or even, if not, moreover, but also, introducing an additional property or fact;
- (interjection) sure, just so, right, I see, expressing that something is (now) clear or a more general agreement

Etymology: descendant of Old Borlish oðiȝ "truly, certainly", which reflects Latin adverb utique "in any case, at least, in particular". The term in its adverbial use is now restricted to very formal writing, and the clarifying sense is also more of the written than spoken register.

The final two sets of senses are sometimes held to be an unrelated compound, comprising Old Borlish o, oð, ou, ouð "whether" and iȝ "there". These come from Latin aut "or" and ibi "there" respectively.

L'oc defey sera dur oðig inacavabr.

192.3: egnam "lumber"

egnam /ijˈnam/ [ɪjˈnam]
- timber, lumber, wood from trees used for construction;
- plank, a long and thick piece of timber;
- beam, post, rafter, a heavy piece of wood used to provide support for some part of a building;
- (colloquial, dated) idiot, dumbass, pillock, simpleton, somebody stupid;
- (vulgar, usually jocular) dick, cock, a penis

Etymology: Middle Borlish, rebracketing of earlier legnam "timber" reinterpreting the initial <l-> as the definite article. This is a borrowing from some Romance language's cognate of Medieval Latin lignāmen "timber"; it cannot be a direct descendant because native words reflect -āmen as -amn, cf. eramn "bronze", scamn "swarm". The word is no longer current as a personal insult except in one-off comparisons of somebody to a literal plank; in vulgar use the term is attested from the 1970s but may be much older.

192.4: pentis "bivouac"

pentis /pɛnˈtɪz/ [pɪnˈtɪz]
- hut, shed, outbuilding, a small structure built as storage or shelter;
- annex, extension, a further interior section added to a building;
- lean-to, an attachment onto the outside of a building;
- bivouac, an improvised overnight shelter

Etymology: Middle Borlish, borrowed from contemporary French apentis "appendage, attached building". This reflects appendicium, a Medieval Latin variant of Classical appendix "supplement, addition". In the last sense it was originally restricted to military encampments.

Y gardinner apportau un pal des y pentis.
/i ˌgar.dɪˈnɛr ˌa.pɔrˈto ɪn pal dɛz i pɛnˈtɪz/

192.5: Borlish Adjectives

Borlish adjectives have two forms: a base form and a comparative form. The comparative is formed by adding a suffix, which shifts stress to the penultimate syllable.
Regular Comparative in -essem

The regular comparative suffix is -essem, which replaces or follows the final segment of the adjective and attracts penultimate stress.

    ‹leger legeressem›
    /leˈʒɛr ˌle.ʒeˈrɛ.sɛm/
    'light lighter'

Several orthographic adjustments may occur when the suffix is added. Before the vowel-initial suffix, ‹ç› becomes ‹c›, while ‹c› becomes ‹ch› to preserve the /k/ pronunciation.

    ‹lavaç lavacessem | starc starchessem›
    /laˈvats ˌla.vaˈtsɛ.sɛm | stark starˈkɛ.sɛm/
    'wasteful {more wasteful} | strong stronger'

After a final orthographic ‹-q›, a linking ‹-u-› is inserted.

    ‹picq picquessem›
    /pɪk pɪˈkwɛ.sɛm/
    'small smaller'

The final consonant may be doubled in the comparative form to maintain the checked quality of the preceding vowel. This occurs most commonly with final ‹-l›.

    ‹boncop boncoppessem›
    /bɔnˈkɔp ˌbɔn.kɔˈpɛ.sɛm/
    'cheap cheaper'

The final consonant may be voiced in the comparative form. This is seen most commonly in present participles ending in ‹-nt› (which form comparatives in ‹-ndessem›) and in adjectives ending in fricatives, though only final ‹-f› reflects this orthographically as ‹-vessem›.

    ‹tart tardessem | braf bravessem›
    /tart tarˈdɛ.sɛm | braf braˈvɛ.sɛm/
    'late later | brave braver'

Adjectives ending in a written ‹-Vu› diphthong form the comparative in ‹-Vvessem›.

    ‹blau blavessem›
    /blo blaˈvɛ.sɛm/
    'blue bluer'

Certain historically long vowels in the final syllable of an adjective may shorten in the comparative form. This occurs most commonly with adjectives ending in ‹-ous›.

    ‹fatuous fatuosessem›
    /faˈtjuz ˌfa.tjoˈzɛ.sɛm/
    'clumsy clumsier'

Adjectives ending in ‹-e› form the comparative in ‹-eyessem›.

    ‹idone idoneyessem›
    /ˌi.doˈne ˌi.doˈnjɛ.sɛm/
    'convenient {more convenient}'

Adjectives in Syllabic -r

Adjectives ending in syllabic ‹-r› show several patterns. Occasionally they form regular comparatives in ‹-ressem›.

    ‹jundr jundressem›
    /ˈʒɪn.dr̩ ʒɪnˈdrɛ.sɛm/
    'junior {more junior}'

Some adjectives, most notably those ending in the suffix ‹-abr› "-able", form comparatives in ‹-lessem› rather than ‹-ressem›.

    ‹stabr stablessem | sengr senglessem›
    /ˈstab.r̩ staˈblɛ.sɛm | ˈsɛn.gr̩ sɛnˈglɛ.sɛm/
    'steady steadier | simple simpler'

The majority of adjectives ending in syllabic ‹-r› form the comparative with the suffix ‹-errem›, which replaces the final syllabic consonant and is stressed penultimately. The same adjustments that affect ‹-essem› may also affect ‹-errem›.

    ‹nuvr nuverrem | diçr dicerrem›
    /ˈnɪv.r̩ niˈvɛ.rɛm | ˈdɪts.r̩ diˈtsɛ.rɛm/
    'fresh fresher | great greater'

    ‹allagr allagherrem | leur leverrem›
    /aˈlɛj.r̩ ˌa.lɛˈjɛ.rɛm | ˈlau.r̩ leˈvɛ.rɛm/
    'happy happier | free freer'

Irregular Comparatives

A few adjectives show irregular stem changes in the comparative.

    ‹brey bressem›
    /bri ˈbrɛ.sɛm/
    'short shorter'

Several common adjectives have fully suppletive comparative forms.

    ‹bon ottem | mal pessem | gran maissem›
    /bɔn ˈɔ.tɛm | mal ˈpɛ.sɛm | gran ˈme.sɛm/
    'good better | bad worse | big bigger'

193.2: mejoncr "mid"

mejoncr /meˈʒɔnk.r̩/ [mɪˈjɔŋ.kɐ]
- mid, mediocre, middling, average, OK, decent, of only moderate quality (usually disappointingly so);
- indifferent, lukewarm, unenthusiastic, not showing much excitement or optimism;
- unremarkable, forgettable, failing to make a strong impression;
- safe, cautious, risk-averse, avoiding extremes or deviation (of choices or behaviour);
- ambivalent, mixed, neither clearly good nor bad

Etymology: alteration of Middle Borlish mejocr "middling" under the influence of unrelated words like coroncr "impostor" and pujoncr "dagger" (whose endings descend from the diminutive suffix -(un)culus in Latin). This was borrowed directly from Latin mediocris "mediocre", a possible compound of medius "middle" and ocris "rugged mountain" (as to suggest "halfway up").

I da empley a xiphar mejoncr naðusc.

193.3: desjovar "uncouple"

desjovar /ˌdɛz.ʒoˈvar/ [ˌdɛz.ʝʊˈvɐː]
- unyoke, uncouple, unlink, to remove from a yoke or harness;
- detach, disengage, unfasten, separate, to cause to be apart;
- liberate, free, to deliver from oppression or imprisonment;
- (colloquial, reflexive) divorce, to end a marriage;
- unplug, disconnect, to sever the link between an electrical appliance and the mains

Etymology: Middle Borlish, derivative of jovar "yoke, tie together, match; (later) plug in". This is either a direct descendant of Latin iugō "I join, yoke" or more likely a re-verbing via jou < Latin iugum "yoke". The term was used metaphorically almost at once, especially in religious contexts. In both the colloquial and electrical senses the word is first attested in the nineteenth century.

Skig sdroyet desjovar cant moustr se migrn.
/skai sdrɔˈjɛt ˌdɛz.ʒoˈvar kant mus.tr̩ se ˈmɪg.rn̩/

193.4: outrvalir "overestimate"

outrvalir /ˌut.r̩.vaˈlɪr/ [ˌu.tɐ.vɐˈlɪː]
- overrate, inflate, to imagine to be better or greater in some respect than in truth;
- highball, overestimate, to make a guess at a value that is too high;
- (reflexive) overween, boast, swagger, brag, vaunt, to act in an arrogant or conceited manner

Etymology: early Modern Borlish, derivation of valir "be worth" < Latin valeō "I am strong" with the prefix outr- < Latin ultrā "beyond" (compare independent Borlish words outr "complete, utter" and doutr "beyond"). In reflexive use the word is attested from the Long Peace period at the turn of the nineteenth century.

L'oç bougr s'outrval cos outr.

193.5: Aqueous Axton

Axton (Parisian French Grand-Aix /gʀãˈdɛiks/, Willem Dutch Aughen /ˈɔ.xn̩/) [Aachen] is a major city in the polity of Willemy and the municipal centre of the region of Avosche. It is located on the Worm river, which flows via the Rudder [Rur] into the Maze [Meuse].

The name of the city derives from post-Classical German *Ākā "Axton", attested in late Old English as Aces tūn "*Ākā's town". This in turn was borrowed from Latin aqua "water", in reference to the local thermal springs. The placename was pluralised in most Dutch languages, while in French languages the placename acquired the descriptor grand- "great" to distinguish it from other towns named Aix for their bathing waters. Compare the Borlish city of Axbane, from the Latin Aquis Balnei "to the bathing waters".

The city was of mostly ceremonial importance through the second millennium, as the seat of the county (then the march, then the duchy) of Avosche within Willemy. Roger Nassow, first duke of Avosche in the early sixteenth century, oversaw the construction and expansion of the Nassow palace complex in the foothills of the Eiffel range which overlooked the city. During this time, the city was in the territory of French Guillenne.

Axton grew dramatically into an industry town around the turn of the nineteenth century and through the Global Workshop period. This was made possible by the advent of transport of freight by convoy [train] instead of by water, since the Rudder and Worm rivers are not navigable by large ships. The city also became a hub for learning, with the Axton Benet School rising in prominence under the stewardship of professors such as mathematician Nicolas Defechet/Niclás de Feght.

continued translation from the beginning of [real-life] book The Henchmen of Zenda by KJ Charles, a 2018 pastiche of the 1894 romp The Prisoner of Zenda.

There is a long railway journey ahead of me, a glass of brandy to my hand, and a heavily and obscenely annotated copy of the Rassendyll manuscript by my side.

194.2: ou "whether"

ou /u/ [u]
- a particle forming polar questions placed directly after the constituent being interrogated;
- whether, if, whether or not, introducing clauses that are in doubt;
- either, introducing the first of two or more options

Etymology: Old Borlish o ou, "or; question particle", a direct descendant of Latin aut "or". In the last sense, the term was originally used for all the options in a list, but in the modern language the latter options are introduced by ben "or" < Latin bene "well". In the second sense it alternates with ig "that" < Latin ibi "there", which introduced realis clauses; the prototype examples are jo saif ig X "I know that X", jo saif noc ou X "I don't know whether X".

This word is unrelated to homographic ou "egg" < ōvum in Latin.

Se poð ou scadom ben ugnlac accatar.
/se pɔθ u xaˈdɔm bɛn ainˈlak ˌa.kaˈtar/

##

194.3: farau "never mind"

farau /faˈro/ [fɐˈʀo]
- oh well, never mind, no big deal, no sweat, it's OK, an injunction not to worry about something;
- hang in there, c'est la vie, so it goes, a reassurance that things will turn out well despite a setback

Etymology: early Modern Borlish, a clipping of the phrase (still occasionally seen in full) tal farau nos "such is life", literally "so we fare". The verb farar "fare; exist (in a given state)" was borrowed in the Old Borlish period from Old English faran "go, travel; fare". The expression originally represented commiseration (a sense which it partially retains as a self-directed expletive); in its modern senses it is seen from the nineteenth century.

J'ignoy hayennaç assignar, ma farau.

194.4: skighar "refrain from"

skighar /skaˈjar/ [skɐˈʝɐː]
- avoid, abstain from, to not interact with in some way (as of food, vice, etc);
- eschew, shun, ostracise, exclude, to refuse to associate with (a person or idea) due to fear or moral rectitude;
- refrain from, not do, to stop oneself from performing some action (especially in the infinitive)

Etymology: Old Borlish iskiȝar "to flee, escape"; compare synonymous eschiver in Old French and sċīen "fear, recoil, startle" in Old English, all descending from Classical German sciuhas "frightened, timid, shy". The last senses are now by far the most common, originally a colloquial alternative for prohibitive constructions but now ubiquitous.

some more completely arbitrary dictionary entries from the Concise Onomatory o'Merch (fifth edition), a reference work published in 1961 and compiled by the Utcheter Lexical Association.

coke [/kuːk/ "carbon"] n. the corporal [elements] whose atoms have six mora [protons], found in innumerable substances vital for life, as well as multiple inanimate forms like pencil-coke and diamond; any of several black substances which remain after the burning of wood, principally comprising coke. 17C, singular of cokes, colks < northern dialect term colk "apple core; heartwood; lump of coal". Further origin uncertain. Possibly allied with Frise colk "hole, socket", though the semantic connection is tenuous.

iliad [/ˈəi.ʒad/ "glance"] n. the act of directing the gaze towards someone in an attempt to communicate something without words; such an act intended as a flirtation or amorous advance; any act of non-verbal communication esp. with flirtatious intent. 16C in various forms < Roun French uilliad "ogle" < uil "eye" < Latin oculus "æq."; formerly often eyliad or similar by analogy to ey [eye].

oakcorn [/ˈoːkˌkoːn/ "acorn"] n. the fruit of the oak tree; a suit in the Danaw [Danube] deck of cards; vulgarly, the head of the penis or burris [clitoris]. Folk formation from early Merch akern < Old æcern "oakcorn, tree-mast"; in sexual use from the 15C.

urchin [/ˈoː.tʃɪn/ "hedgehog"] n. a small mammal characterised by its spiny back and habit of rolling up into a ball; in military use, an arrangment of spikes scattered across the ground as an obstacle. Alteration of early Merch irchon [/irˈtʃun/] < Drengot French irechon < Vulgar Latin ērīciō < Classical Latin ērīcius "urchin". Displaced contemporaneous iel < Old English iġil "urchin".

notes in translation on Borland in the Iron Age.

The last significant such wave was of early Brythonic speakers on Albion settling Borland from the west in the fourth century aN, the ancestors of the small hill-fort kingdoms which covered the island at the time of the Roman invasion in the first century N.

195.2: sdroyet "drive"

sdroyet /sdrɔˈjɛt/ [zdʀʊˈʝɛt]
- (archaic, historical) étui, toolbox, a miniature (often ornamental) case for holding small items like needles or other utilitarian things;
- drive, card, a device for storing digital data;

Etymology: diminutive of noun sdroy "depot, warehouse, stockpile", first attested in Middle Borlish isdroȝ "freight, goods transported by water". This was borrowed via synoymous zdruog in contemporary Saxon, likely from Polish zdroi "spring, small stream; origin, source". The historical and modern senses are presumed to be independent derivations; the latter first appears over a century after the former became practically obsolete.

195.3: oistr "wedlock"

oistr /ˈɔjs.tr̩/ [ˈɔi.stɐ]
- (poetic) marriage, wedlock, matrimony, the state of being married;
- unity, agreement, consonance, harmony, compatibility, the condition of fitting well together

Etymology: borrowed in the early modern period from old northern dialect term oistre "wife", which descends directly from synonymous uxor in Latin (compare Old French uissor "wife"). The shift in meaning appears to be due to the poet Bautrmeu, who introduced the term to standard Borlish in her work Mornç a Morn "A Piece of the Action". It is presumed that she misinterpreted the (even then archaic) northern idiom prendr n'oistr "to wed, lit. to take as wife" as "to take in wedlock".

Noc saif no's oistr eld ogtoç.
/nɔk sef nɔz ˈɔjs.tr̩ ɛld ɔjˈtɔts/

195.4: foncçondry "agency"

foncçondry /ˌfɔn.ksɔnˈdri/ [fɔŋ.ksʊnˈdʀi]
- agency, business, establishment, an entity engaged in commerce (usually in the service industry) or the building in which it is located;
- department, office, an administrative unit of a government or its headquarters;
- (in particular, euphemistically) intelligence agency, an organisation for gathering information relevant to national security and defence

Etymology: eighteenth century, derivation via the gestalt-forming suffix -ry from noun foncçon "purpose, use". In turn this was borrowed from Latin fūnctiō "performance, execution (of a task)". The governmental sense is original; in commercial use compare similarly-formed words like vessondry "clothier" and govondry "canteen". In espionage the word is seen from the twentieth century, originally as in-house slang.

195.5: Borland in the FIrst Millennium

questions and commentary from the August 2025 edition of an Insular History scitation [exam] taken by many Borlish school students at the age of fifteen.

…rulers of the First Roman Empire personally stepped foot on Borland, and what were the contexts of their visits?

Most students correctly named Claudius and Hadrian; almost all cited the former's role in orchestrating the conquests of Britain and Borland and incorporating them into the Roman Empire, and the latter's tour leading to the creation of a Borlish province (Īnsula Borālum or occasionally Borālia) separate from Britain. Common mistakes included later emperors like Septimius Severus and Constantius Chlorus, who fought in Britain; by the third-century the territory of Borland was much more secure than Britain, having been conquered in its entirely and thus requiring fewer fortifications against incursions. Another mistaken inclusion seen repeatedly was Diocletian, likely due to the curriculum mentioning the creation of the Diocese of Borland (from the former Borlish province) during the administrative reforms of his reign.

4. Describe the process by which the post-Imperial Diocese of Borland became a hereditary monarchy (the First Kingdom of Borland) by the turn of the seventh century.

Answers tended either to parrot the pat narrative of a century ago or, more promisingly, to mirror the state of current scholarship. There are relatively certain historical facts regarding Victor Rossetus (r. ca. 420–?) that most could recall, being the first ruler of a re-cobbled-together Diocese of Borland after the island was abandoned by the state apparatus of the First Roman Empire around the year 400 N and while the west and south of the island were being settled by German peoples. At the other end, the genealogy of the so-called Rosseð dynasty, first royal house of the First Kingdom of Borland (who claimed descend from Victor Rossetus), only becomes more plausible than semi-mythical around 620 N. The two intermediate centuries are frustratingly ill-documented, but the best student responses managed to…

The name of this event, coined in the nineteenth century as a hypothetical (several decades before evidence of the impact was actually discovered) to explain the extinction in the fossil record, refers to its location—temporally at the end of, and therefore geologically on top of, the Draconic Age (2.5–0.66 great myriad years ago).

196.2: entrjair "interpose"

entrjair /ˌɛn.tr̩ˈʒer/ [ˌɛn.tɐˈʝeː]
- interpose, insert, wedge, jam, tuck, to place between two things or in the midst of something;
- (reflexive) intervene, mediate, to involve oneself in a situation;
- (reflexive) interrupt, interject, pipe up, to say something as an interruption

Etymology: Middle Borlish, from now-archaic jair "throw" and prefix entr- "between" or directly from Latin intericiō "I throw between" (with remodelling after the Borlish words). Nowadays the word is mostly seen in its reflexive senses.

Dou alumn pagl ny preu rig s'entrjeirn.

196.3: irruniscabiltað "contradiction"

irruniscabiltað /ɪˌri.niˌxa.bɪlˈtaθ/ [ɪˌʀi.nɪˌxa.bɪlˈtaθ]
- contradiction, paradox, incongruity, inconsistency, unresolvable conflict between two or more parts of something;
- abnormality, oddity, something unusual;
- irregularity, a violation of bureaucratic rules or procedure especially as evidence of a crime

Etymology: noun from irruniscabr "contradictory", itself formed from runir "reunite; reconcile" with the potential suffix -abr and negative suffix ir-, from -ābilis and ir- in Latin. The verb runir comes from Medieval Latin reūniō "I reunite", from ūnus "one". In concrete use describing a particular contradictory thing, the word is attested from the early twentieth century.

Y lat de dou ascreir quocent produg irruniscabiltað.

- intervention, interference, participation, the action of getting involved to affect something;
- contribution, input, something given or offered that adds to a larger whole;
- gesture, act, something done (especially when intended to help)

Etymology: Middle Borlish, noun from droughar "join in, help out, contribute, interfere". This was borrowed from Old English drēogan "to do (a duty)", initially used principally in religious contexts, as of providing Christian charity.

Nos deyeu vos benaular por vossy droughanç.

197.2: aðm "treasure"

aðm /ˈað.m̩/ [ˈa.ðɐm]
- treasure, jewel, gem, something extremely valuable;
- darling, dear, sweetheart, a term of endearment for someone one loves;
- lover, mistress, cicisbeo, paramour, beau, an (illicit, unofficial or at least sub-marital) sexual or romantic partner;
- (media) MacGuffin, an object the pursuit of which drives the plot but whose precise identity and qualities are unspecified or irrelevant

Etymology: from Old Borlish aðm "concubine, paramour; (poss.) treasure" (the object sense is contemporaneously unattested, but later use suggests a retention), alteration of presumed *maðm via rebracketing with Old Borlish m(e) "my". It was borrowed from Old English māþm "precious object, jewel". Until the advent of the last sense in the twentieth century, the word had usually been restricted to possessive constructions.

Y duc nos dau l'acconnosc de sell'aðm.

197.3: plouçastr "theatre"

plouçastr /pluˈtsas.tr̩/ [plʊˈtsa.stɐ]
- pretence, charade, deception, a faked appearance or series of events;
- pantomime, harlequinade, a clowning and fantastical theatrical performance;
- farce, sham, a ridiculous or inane show;
- theatre, lip service, tokenism, window dressing, pointless actions taken entirely for the look of the thing

Etymology: nineteenth century, pejorative derivation from plouç "screen, disguise; façade, persona". This is a descendant of Latin pluteus "railing; screen", possibly via Old French. The term was originally used in the playhouse senses to describe a style of theatre imported from Saxony. In the last senses it dates to the 1940s in political criticism.

197.5: Landmarks and Legends

notes on various aspects of the Boralverse alternate history setting which begin with the letter L.

Laurent Burnows (Merch /laːn ˈboː.nəz/, fl. 2002–) is an author from Markland. He rose to fame in the first decade of the 21st century with Back to Front, a series of children's books about a partsicular school class going on time-travel adventures with their teachers. His first foray into a more mature style was the 2015 trevold [novel] The First Thing That Went Wrong, debuting the series An Incovenient Armageddon; the series proved a great success with the audience—now teens and adults—who had grown up with his children's stories.

The Library of Sobjan (Majoric [Hungarian] Sobiani Cønvtár) has a claim to the title of Europe's oldest continuously-operating library, having been commissioned by King Jambor of Awry [Hungary] and built during his reign in the twelfth century. The city of Sobjan [Pécs], close to the Crovatian border, was an early Majoric capital and remains to this day a centre for arts and culture. Notably old items found in the Library include a copy of a 1261N liber numerorum (translated to Latin from Arabic works written in the Single Caliphate) incorporating a computed table of arrhumb [cosine] values, as well as a copy of the first folio of the mysterious Mysarnos Codex (whose rediscovery in 1939 proved that the Codex was written in a form of Greek).

Lux Æterna: The First Century of Threshold Force (Willem Dutch Onslackbar Vlay: Drampelstøweth tÿdes har Rést Ew) is a 2002 work of documentary history by Cawen ba Dirxen, a scholar at the Varonøw [~Vitória, ES] Higher Edifice. It chronicles the theoretical developments necessary for threshold force [nuclear power], as well as the technology's political, economic and social effects over time. The book was commissioned to mark the centenary of the discovery of the atomic nux [nucleus] in 1902 at the city's Nÿstad Atellier.

198.1: Lexember 2025 - 1: offiçar "set"

offiçar /ˌɔ.fiˈtsar/ [ˌɔ.fɪˈtsɐː]
- appoint, nominate, select, elect, to formally name to a particular rank or position of responsibility;
- designate, assign, allocate, to bestow a role or duty upon;
- post, set, emplace, station, deploy, to place at a particular location to perform a particular task

Etymology: late Middle Borlish, a derivation either vernacularly or within Scholastic Latin from noun offiç "office, position; duty, responsibility, task", from synonymous officium in Classical Latin. The term was originally most common in military and ceremonial contexts, and has broadened significantly to many technical settings.

198.2: Lexember 2025 - 2: entisar "set"

entisar /ˌɛn.tiˈzar/ [ˌɛn.tɪˈzɐː]
- tighten, tauten, to cause to be under tension;
- strain, stress, to apply force to;
- stiffen, starch, to make rigid via some artificial means;
- lay, set, set up, prepare, arm, (of a trap) to make ready to function via some mechanism;
- cock, ready, prime, to bring a spring (etc.) under tension in advance of firing;
- (esp. reflexive) brace, poise, marshal, steel, to steady or prepare (a person, equipment) for sudden or violent action;
- engage, to bring (a mechanism or device) into a state of readiness or interlock

Etymology: Old Borlish, verbal derivation from tis, tes "taut, stretched". This descends from synonymous tēnsus in Latin, past participle of tendō "I stretch; I strive". The senses pertaining to traps and weaponry, first attested in the fourteenth century, derive from the action of arming a trap or crossbow by placing a string under tension. More general mechanical senses are attested from the seventeenth century, along with the reflexive usage.

198.3: Lexember 2025 - 3: beyollir "set"

beyollir /bjɔˈlɪr/ [bjʊˈlɪː]
- set, insert, fit, embed, to affix into a recess or opening (as of a jewel);
- install, build in, to put into a dedicated position during construction;
- slot into, plug in, to place (an outward facing part) into (an opening which it is designed to fit into)

Etymology: Middle Borlish, derivation via the change-of-state suffix -ir, -isc < Latin -ēscō "I become _" from noun beyol "socket, cavity; dimple, divot". This appears to be an Old Borlish backformation from short-lived abiolar "to form a cavity, ?to awl", via Medieval Latin albiolō from Classical alveolus "small hollow; trough, basin". The word has been used for forming electrical connections since the late nineteenth century.

198.4: Lexember 2025 - 4: scið "set"

scið /xɪθ/ [çɪθ]
- known, understood, familiar, recognised, being within one's understanding;
- ordained, determined, having been decided upon by some authority;
- set, fixed, no longer subject to alteration;
- possible, feasible, permissible, being among the options one can or may choose from

Etymology: from Old Borlish scið "known, determined", a direct descendant from Latin scītus "learnt, known, appointed". This was the perfect participle of both sciō "I know" and scīscō "I learn". The last senses reflect the word's Borlish use as the suppletive past participle of poðir "to be able to", whose past tense, imperfect subjunctive and past participle were replaced with forms from sciō in the Old Borlish period. In early use the "fixed" sense was used principally to refer to certain Christian feast days and canonical hours.

198.5: Lexember 2025 - 5: orisontment "set"

orisontment /ˌo.ri.zɔntˈmɛnt/ [ˌo.ʀɪ.zʊntˈmɛnt]
- (astronomy) set, the passage of a celestial body below the apparent horizon;
- conclusion, wrap-up, dénouement, the process of something coming to a close;
- (poetic) old age, dotage, the latter years of life;
- (mathematics) convergence, the property of a sequence or analogous object approaching a particular value

Etymology: Middle Borlish, originally a term of art for the first sense, noun derivation from orisontar "set, pass below the horizon". This comes from orisont "horizon; range, limit, ambit" (since displaced in the first sense by lovacq "horizon", from Arabic), via Latin from Greek ὁρῐ́ζων • horízōn "horizon". In mathematics the term is seen from the eighteenth century.

The Thirteenth Century

collected notes on various features of the thirteenth century.

Wilhelm Brüz (fl. 1225) was mayor of the city of Augsburg for at least a decade in the first half of thirteenth century. He was a personal friend of Paul von Burchadt, the future first Pope of the Augsburg See, and Brüz's personal ambitions for his city are thought to have influenced some of the religious policy outlines in the Pauline Denuncations of 1225. Brüz was portrayed by Hunter Noteworthy in the 1961 Merch-language film With the North Star to Guide Us, a dramatisation of the events of the German Secession. A magnified statue of Brüz (not based on any extant description or depiction of the man, since none exists) was erected in 1975 outside Augsburg's town hall.

Ivan of Cartaw (fl. ca. 1280) was a lord of Cartaw [Cardiff] who, during his reign, undertook the conquest of the Devon peninsula. Devon had become formally independent from the kingdom of Kernow [Brittany] some decades prior, ruled by a cadet branch of the latter's royal house. Ivan of Cartau's conquest appears to have initially been without the assent or support of his liege King David; nonetheless, the king treated the campaign much like Wales's other territorial gains of the thirteenth century, creating the Tallath of Devon and awarding its rule to Ivan's son Marduth (Ivan having died of an illness shortly after the conquest's completion).

On Unknown Areas Scribed by Arcs (written ca. 1211)  is a work by Tal of Murcia. Containing little original work by the author, it is primarily a translation and compilation of earlier advancements in geometry from Cairene mathemticians. It contains the first attestation of the term mozate "two-dimensional, planar" in its Latinate form muzātus, borrowed from Arabic مُسَطَّح • (musaṭṭaḥ) "flat, even, level".

198.6: Lexember 2025 - 6: despondr "set"

despondr /dɛˈspɔn.dr̩/ [dɪˈspɔn.dɐ]
- arrange, organise, set up, to put in useful positions;
- prepare, lay, set, to make ready for use by placing things on or around it in a particular arrangement;
- incline, mind, dispose, prime, to make (someone) more likely to act in a particular fashion;
- have access to, have available, avail oneself, have on hand, to be able to conveniently use;
- employ, have employed, make use of, to have access to the labour or benefits of

Etymology: descending from Old Borlish desponre "distribute, set out" or reborrowed during the Middle Borlish period from its source in Latin dispōnō "I arrange". The latter senses, likely influenced by cognates in other Romance languages, are intransitive and used with preposition de "of, from".

Me storra i vin y tabr despondr pre nos pascau.
/me stɔˈra i vɪn i ˈtab.r̩ dɛˈspɔn.dr̩ pre nɔz paˈxo/

198.7: Lexember 2025 - 7: ereðmfeyar "set"

ereðmfeyar /eˌrɛð.m̩ˈfjar/ [ɪˌʀɛ.ðɐmˈfjɐː]
- synchronise, sync, to cause to occur at the same time;
- set, wind, regulate, to adjust (a timepiece) so that it displays the correct time;
- align, line up, right, coordinate, harmonise, to position in a symmetric arrangement or (more generally) to cause to take a convenient or aesthetically pleasing form;
- regularise, normalise, standardise, to make more consistent or unexceptional; 
- superimpose, overlap, to place one atop another so that particular parts are in alignment

Etymology: Middle Borlish derivative of ereðm "symmetry; coincidence; happenstance" with the factitive suffix -feyar < Latin -ficō "I make _". The noun descends from Old Borlish eredme "alignment, order, regularity", of uncertain origin. The word has traditionally been connected to Latin rhythmus "rhythm, cadence", ignoring the phonetic problems and the lack of cognates in other Romance languages, mostly due to a dearth of other options. Neither a hypothetical Old English *ġerǣdedōm "readiness" nor Old Norse *ǫrrǫðsemi "straight-line-ness" have been much credited.

199.1: Lexember 2025 - 8: hoxar "set"

hoxar /hɔˈksar/ [hʊˈksɐː]
- set, sic, to cause (e.g. an animal) to make an attack or pursuit;
- rile up, aggravate, rabble-rouse, agitate, to cause to become excited or angry especially at some perceived villain or scapegoat

Etymology: early Modern Borlish, allied (along with interjection hox "attack!") with Saxon hoxen, Bavarn huchsen and Carnish huschken, all meaning roughly the same thing. Possibly just a onomatopoetic formation, but the formal similarity of Crovatian huškati "provoke" is also suggestive.

Jasper Detchard's Military Career

continued translation from the beginning of [real-life] book The Henchmen of Zenda by KJ Charles, a 2018 pastiche of the 1894 romp The Prisoner of Zenda.

I left the Army with numerous prizes for swordplay, a dishonourable discharge, a reputation for cheating at cards (fairly earned), another for indulgence in the fuck that dare not speak its name (ditto), and a request from my family that I no longer claim kinship with them, since they wanted none with me.

199.2: Lexember 2025 - 9: phthongar "set"

phthongar /fθɔnˈgar/ [fθʊŋˈgɐː]
- set, to compose a piece of sung music for (a given text);
- arrange, orchestrate, cover, to create a new version of (a piece of music) with different e.g. instrumentation;
- adapt, translate, to create a work based on (a piece of art, writing, etc) for a different medium;
- reformat, repackage, rebrand, to comprehensively change the structure and/or nature of

Etymology: originally in the first sense and specifically in religious contexts, as of writing choral music whose lyrics were taken from a particular hymn or homily. The term is a borrowing from Scholastic Latin phthongō "I set (to music)", itself from synonymous φθογγῶ • (phthongṓ) in Malchassian Greek. Broadening of the word's senses to other forms of art and writing is seen from the eighteenth century.

Alcun hom nole l'oç od phthongar a caum.

- band, ensemble, orchestra, group, musicians who perform together;
- set, kit, equipment, apparatus, a collection of instruments of tools collectively employed for some purpose;
- outfit, kit, a set of articles of clothing worn together

Etymology: early modern borrowing in all senses from French ensemble "together; outfit, kit, music group". This descends directly from the Latin adverb īnsimul "together, simultaneously". The term is particularly used for informal or temporary groupings, as well as games and other entertainment.

algebrar /ˌal.ʒɛˈbrar/ [ˌal.ʝɪˈbʀɐː]
- set, reduce, to put (a broken or dislocated bone) back into an optimal position for healing;
- restitute, restore, repatriate, to return to a rightful owner;
- resolve, settle, to restore balance or proper standing in (a debt or conflict);
- take back, recover, reconquer, reunify, to reincorporate territory into a state

Etymology: Middle Borlish, borrowed from Scholastic Latin algebrō "I set (a bone)" along with noun algebr < algebra "bone-setting; restitution". This occurs in medical texts from as early as the twelfth century translated from Arabic, a borrowing from الْجَبْر • al-jabr "restoration, compulsion". Financial use is attested from the seventeenth century; political from the late nineteenth (in the run-up to the Millstone War).

- stint, spell, stretch, any delimited amount of time dedicated to a particular activity;
- (games) set, a group of rounds of a game (esp. racket sports) which counts as a unit for the team that wins more than half of them

Etymology: eighteenth century, allied with Norman valque, Kentish or Willem walk, Saxon walke, and many others all meaning "bout; (racket sports) set". Use for less unpleasant periods of time is a Borlish innovation dating to the early twentieth century, originally with sarcastic force. The ultimate origin is almost certainly Boham [Czech] wálca "war", but influence from Kentish verb walken "to move, travel; to occur, take place" is not unlikely.

Unresolved Linguistic History

excerpt in translation from 2004 article A New History of Rust (originally in Borlish as Un Histoir Novel de Rougl), an academic overview of the linguistic history of sub-Roman Borland (approximately, the time after Latin ceased to be regularly written on Borland outside monasteries and before the first surviving longform vernacular texts).

…summary, the chronology of the following changes from Vulgar Latin to Old Borlish: (1) /au/ to /o/, as in Latin causa and Old Borlish cos "matter, thing"; (2) /alC/ to /auC/, as in Latin alter and Old Borlish autre "other"; (3) /al[ə]C/ > /alC/, as in Latin calidus and Old Borlish calt "hot", is irreducibly blurry on the margins. Even if in general these are supposed to have taken place in this order, re-classicisations like taur "bull" (earlier tor) from Latin taurus and mere exceptions like unproductive adjectival suffix -autr from Latin -aliter must be accounted for.

We turn to the question on the early Old Borlish lexicon about which perhaps the most scholarship has been written. Since the Merch linguist Buthick Morstan first suggested the existence of an Insular Latin word *urum "man" in 1909, data supporting her theory has continued to trickle in, while never becoming overwhelmingly convincing. Moreover, even if the majority of experts accept the existence of this word, the field is split on whether it is simply a phonetic variant of Classical Latin virum "man", or else a borrowing from Borland Kelt vurum, urum "man" (compare Brythonic guur, whence Welsh gwr "man").

Morstan was aware of potential surviving traces of this term, such as dialect terms like orrel "penis" and orjan "scarecrow", as well as personal names like Orrin, but she was writing before the discovery of Roman-era…

199.6: Lexember 2025 - 13: tannir "set"

tannir /taˈnɪr/ [tɐˈnɪː]
- tan, to change animal hide into leather through soaking in tannic acid;
- fire, bake, kiln, to treat (e.g. pottery) with heat;
- cure, pickle, preserve, to alter (e.g. meat) by chemical treat for preservation or use;
- set, fix, mordant, to make (e.g. dye) fast or permanent;
- vulcanise, to treat (rubber) with sulfur to make it harder and more durable

Etymology: Middle Borlish, verbal derviation from the noun tan "oak bark" (from which tannic acid is obtained). This is a borrowing from synonymous tan in Old French, ultimately from Gaulish tannos "green oak". Extension to various other procedure for making materials harder or more durable is seen through the early modern period and into the twentieth century.

199.7: Lexember 2025 - 14: hieratic "set"

hieratic /ˌhje.raˈtɪk/ [ˌhje.ʀɐˈtɪk]
- priestly, sacerdotal, pertaining to priests or analogous religious figures;
- (specifically) hieratic, pertaining to pharaonic priests in Ancient Egypt or to their cursive system of writing;
- impassive, phlegmatic, unemotional, not having or revealing any sentiment;
- stern, set, severe, unyielding, (of expression or countenance) fixed or rigid without any leniency

Etymology: borrowed directly via Scholastic Latin from Greek ἱερατικός • hieratikós "priestly", from the root ῐ̔ερός • hĭerós "sacred". In extended use from the seventeenth century, in parallel with other languages like Vascon, presumably in reference to the stereotypical manner and bearing of priests.

200.1: Lexember 2025 - 15: scenoir "set"

scenoir /xeˈnɔjr/ [çɪˈnɔ.ʝɐ]
- set, film set, the location where e.g. a movie's scenes are arranged to be filmed;
- studio, a place more generally where things such as TV segments are filmed;
- backdrop, framing, the way in which a situation is given context;
- setup, circumstances, the configuration or arrangement of elements or actors in an (e.g. social, political, military) context

Etymology: twentieth century, derivative of scenar "stage (a play), film (a movie)" with the place-forming suffix -oir < -ōrium in Latin. The verb scenar itself comes from scen "stage, theatre", a borrowing from Latin scaena "stage, scene". In metaphorical use the term is seen (first in media criticism) from the 1960s.

200.2: Lexember 2025 - 16: steðig "set"

steðig /steˈðaj/ [stɪˈðaj]
- obstinate, stubborn, resolute, convinced of one's rightness and resistant to correction;
- determined, bent, stuck, steadfast, firmly intending to stick to a particular course of action or point of view;
- set, (of a feeling or belief) fixed and not liable to change

Etymology: descendant of late Old Borlish steðiȝ "stable, constant", borrowed from an early Middle English or Middle Dutch derivative of a cognate of stead "place, position". Initially describing strong convictions, the word has been extended to describe people with such convictions since the seventeenth century.

Sy morrig es steðig sad cas theu.

200.3: Lexember 2025 - 17: govey "set"

govey /goˈvi/ [gʊˈvi]
- brood, covey, a group of game birds such as pheasants or grouse;
- clutch, a group of eggs in a nest;
- litter, a group of newborn animals or (loosely or jocularly) children;
- set, society, circle, acquaintance, a group of persons associated by status or interest (often with mildly deprecatory force)

Etymology: Middle Borlish, borrowed from contemporary Kentish or Norman covey, govee "brood". This is a substantivisation of the past participle of cover "to brood (an egg)", the regular descendant of Latin cubō "I lie down; I incubate" (from whose present tense Borlish cair "to fall" takes its suppletive past tense forms). Extension from venery to other groups of animals is seen from the seventeenth century, and to groups of people from the nineteenth.

hundy /hɪnˈdi/ [hɪnˈdi]
- hotel room, suite, a room or collection of connected rooms in a lodginghouse;
- chambers, apartment, a distinguished group of private rooms in a larger building used as an office or a residence;
- (university) set, lodgings, a student or faculty residence with a separate bedroom (as opposed to cubicr "bedsit, studio")

Etymology: nineteenth century, borrowed from Welsh hundy "bedchamber; (by extension) hotel room". This is a compound of hun "sleep" and ty "house". Initially confined to upmarket use, the word was extended to the university setting around the turn of the twentieth century. Compare roughly contemporaneous randy "apartment" < Welsh rhandy "wing (of a building); apartment".

quaglar /kwɛjˈlar/ [kwɪjˈlɐː]
- curdle, turn, (of e.g. milk) to form curds and no longer flow smoothly;
- clot, coagulate, to change from a liquid to a solid mass;
- set, solidify, stiffen, to become firm or solid in consistency;
- (slang, dated) freeze, be very cold, to be experiencing notably and inconveniently low temperatures

Etymology: direct descendant of Latin coāgulō "I curdle, coagulate", reinforced in the Middle Borlish period by contemporary Portingale or Leon quallo "curds, cottage cheese". The last sense is attested only from the mid-twentieth century and is already rather old-fashioned.

Attenað y zachet vel quaglar oç noit.

Ruritania

collected notes on the small Central European polity of Ruritania.

Ruritania (Borlish Rurtagn, Bavarn Rürzen, Boham Ruravsko) is a minor polity and one of the easternmost European states which primarily speak some variety of German. It is located to the east of Bavarn [Bavaria], to the south of Bohamy [Bohemia] and to the north of Crain [~Slovenia, southern Austria]. Its capital city is Strelsau, located on the banks of the Danaw [Danube].

Toponymy

The traditional account of the origin of the name Ruritania, as a placename derivative of Latin rūs, rūris "countryside", runs into chronological difficulties. Roman control of the region as the province of Noricum shows no evidence of this toponym, and the earliest attestations of the name in the eleventh century do not appear to be Classically inspired (although the modern form <Ruritania> is almost certainly a folk-etymological classicisation based on this account).

In general, linguists expect that there is a Germanic or Slavic origin for the Rur- root. The Rugii, a Germanic tribe who settled the area in the sub-Roman period, are a tempting proposition, although their short-lived Rugiland cannot explain the second -r- in the name. It is also possible that one of the Danaw's tributaries in the region once had a name like Rur (compare the Rure and the Rudder to the northwest), which lent its name to a valley and eventually a state. Multiple Slavic etyma such as rogozi "reeds, rushes" have also been proposed.

The capital is more tractable, being almost certainly a compound of a Slavic root strēla "arrow" and the Germanic placename suffix -au "meadow, floodplain" (the -s- likely representing a Germanic genitive), thought to be in reference to the straightness of the Danaw in the vicinity of Strelsau.

200.6: Lexember 2025 - 20: tas "set"

tas /taz/ [taz]
- bag, satchel, waterskin, a smallish cloth or leather container carried on one's person;
- pouch, pocket, a small and soft compartment for carrying things (also the natural pouch of a marsupial);
- vessel, container, any means of carrying anything (in full generality);
- saucer, bowl, a small and shallow piece of crockery;
- divot, hollow, a recess in a surface for holding small items;
- (mathematics) set, the abstract notion of a structure of which things may or may not be elements

Etymology: the conflation in early Modern Borlish of two words with unrelated etyma. Partially a borrowing from Dutch tas, tasch "bag, pouch", which descends straightforwardly from Classical German tascon "purse, pocket". Partially via French from Mostara tasa "bowl, vessel", a borrowing from Arabic طَاس • ṭās "cup". In the mathematical sense from 1831, in translation from Dümmeyer's 1827 work Sammel und Sendungen "Sets and Functions".

Apar cogleu nos y tas de v ne V yon v.m=x.

- (law) summon, subpoena, to require to appear in court;
- (slang) hook up with, tryst, to meet and have (often illicit) sex with

Etymology: Middle Borlish, borrowed from Latin assignō "I assign, distribute". The legal sense appears to be a clipping of legal Latin brevem assignō "I give out a writ". In the last sense the word is a backformation from earlier assignaçon "tryst", borrowed in the early modern period from French.

Stou dou trevold assignar all'ec alumn.

niveu /niˈvaw/ [nɪˈvaw]
- set, track, stream, a subdivision of students formed into a subject class on the basis of aptitude;
- (by extension) tier, echelon, rank, position in an administrative or military hierarchy

Etymology: late 19th century, borrowed from Roun French nivew "level, tier" during educational reforms in the Drengot Collusion (of which Borland was a part). This was itself borrowed from Parisian, descending after dissimilation and a gender change from Latin lībella "level (builder's tool)". Extension out of the school setting is seen from the mid-20th century.

Ivarrachezurí was the first theorist to record the ability of copper to kill sperm, noting in 1824 that “the seed of the bull, the ram and the stallion alike are made impotent in storing them for some hours in a syringe of copper”.

201.2: Lexember 2025 - 23: jahesment "set"

jahesment /ˌʒa.hɛˈzmɛnt/ [ˌʝa.hɪˈzmɛnt]
- device, contraption, gadget, gizmo, a clever or complicated otherwise-unspecified machine;
- set, receiver, transmitter, a piece of electronic equipment which participates in signalling (as of telegraphy, telephony or television);

Etymology: borrowed from Vascon jahesment "contraption", a derivative of jahès "harness, rig". This in turn was borrowed from Arabic جَهَاز • jahāz "gear, utensil", from a root meaning "to prepare". Specialisation to devices such as telephone or radio sets was first applied to steeplepost equipment around the turn of the 19th century.

- set, to place the action of (a fictional or imaginative work) in a particular setting;
- situate, contextualise, to provide surrounding details for;
- (intransitive) worldbuild, to develop a fictional setting

Etymology: early 20th century, verbal derivation from jagat "setting, world, continuity". This comes via Vascon from Gurjat જગત • jagat "world, universe", used as a term of art for "setting" in literary criticism. In the last sense the word enters general use only around the turn of the millennium.

201.4: Lexember 2025 - 25: Suthocq "Set"

Suthocq /siˈθɔk/ [sɪˈθɔk]
- Set, Seth, Sutekh, an Egyptian deity with dominion over the desert and foreigners;
- Puck, Robin Goodfellow, a recurring trickster figure in various folk/fairy tales;
- an avatar of Christmas jollity in various parts of northern Europe and Mendeva, representing defiance, glittering frost and brightness in the dark

In the last sense, compare Har Suthock /haː ˈsʊ.ðʊk/ "(lit.) frost Set" in Merch, and Nacho Suthoc "(lit.) little-brother Set" in Ambrosian Vask [Basque].

Etymology: 18th century, originally in translation from Arabic سُتُخ • Sutuch "Set". This in turn comes from the very new (and still somewhat inaccurate) decipherment of hieroglyphs, leading to a surge in interest in Egyptian mythology, reflecting the name now usually transcribed as /suː.tiç/ (whence Coptic ⲥⲏⲧ /seːt/).

The transfer of the name from Egyptian mythology to general folktales is the fault of Dutch writer Ton Cráyenschot, who in the early 19th century repurposed the names of deities of various traditions for the supernatural characters in his short stories. The puckish figure of Har Suttock spread into the culture at large far more successfully than most of his inventions, and had become associated with winter festivals in general and Christmas in particular by the turn of the 20th century.

bot /bɔt/ [bɔt]
- sheaf, bundle, bunch, a group of thin objects held together by wrapping or tying;
- bale, a quantity of hay (straw, etc) compressed and tied up for transport;
- (attributive) set, package, (of e.g. a menu or something else bought) comprising several items bundled into a single purchase

Etymology: Middle Borlish, borrowed from contemporary Dutch bote "bundle of flax; tuft". This is likely a derivation from the verb bóten "beat", a descendant of Classical German bautō "I beat, knock, push". In attributive use the word is seen from the late nineteenth century, originally in hotels as a calque from Welsh scub seggo "set menu, (lit.) bundle of dishes".

Y desc bot teyen boncoppessem sur ig l'aus hougr.

False Friends (cont. 4)

some more completely arbitrary dictionary entries from the Concise Onomatory o'Merch (fifth edition), a reference work published in 1961 and compiled by the Utcheter Lexical Association.

glade [/glɛːd/ "sunbeam"] n. a ray, a columnar shaft of sunlight as cast through clouds or canopy; further, a moment of optimism during bleakness or of insight during confusion; a phenomenon of light in the sky near the poles due to the interaction of solar dust with air (also aurorick glade). 15C, early Merch glade, glode "ray of sunlight; sunny place", poss. < unknown Old English glǣd~glād "brightness" related to known glæd "shining, bright". Emotional uses are seen 17C; celestial use from 18C.

jackareigh [/ˈdʒa.kə.ɾɛʃ/ "alligator"] n. either of two large swimming reptiles related to the cockadrills [crocodiles] and native to the Novomund and the Chinas. 17C, from Kentish [-/ri/], via Welsh or Willem Dutch from Yengatow [Tupi] yacaré "jack-a-reigh". Final element adapted to reigh "skate [ray]", partly from Old English reohhe "skate" and partly from Old French raie "skate" (the two are probably related).

toward [/ˈtuː.əd/ "future"] adj. still to come, not yet existing or taking place; of a period of time, next or impending; n. times yet to come, as opposed to now or to times which have already passed. Direct descendant of Old English tōweard adj. "still to come", stressed initially in opposition to homographic tōweard prp. "in the direction of" (modern Merch toward [/twaːd/] "facing").

yuckle [/ˈjʊ.kəl/ "mend"] v. to restore to a state of correct or normal operation; to make whole as by the process of healing; to reattach separated pieces of something broken. 14C early Merch yokelen "reattach", frequentative or diminutive of yoken "yoke, harness", from Old English gegeocian "yoke". Probably unrelated to Old English gēocian "preserve, rescue, save".

201.6: Lexember 2025 - 27: ormal "set"

ormal /ɔrˈmal/ [ʊːˈmal]
- quiver, quiverful, a container for arrows (bolts, darts, etc) or the contents of such a container;
- (obsolete, vulgar) vagina, the sex organ connecting the vulva and the cervix;
- salvo, volley, an instance of concentrated fire from artillery;
- programme, set, the scheduled list of pieces of music that are to be played at a concert (or a similar timeline of discrete events)

Etymology: an Old Borlish borrowing from Old Norse ǫrmalr "quiver". This is a compound of ǫr "arrow" and malr "case"; the former is from Classical German arhuō "arrow", while the latter is likely allied with malhō "leather bag" (although the change of declension is unexplained). The vulgar sense was current in the Middle Borlish period and enjoyed a brief resurgence in the 19th century due to conscious use in historical novels. The musical senses are attested from the 1920s, originally in reference to recorded music played over the radio.

- direct, guide, to explain how to get to a particular location;
- point, face, orient, to cause to be turned in given direction;
- (computing) set, assign, to give a particular value

Etymology: early modern Borlish, a backformation from earlier uscer "doorman, porter". This is a borrowinng of Kentish usher "doorman", via synonymous ussier in Old French and ultimately ōstiārius in Latin. This etymon is an agentive formation from ōstium "door". The word was first used for changing the orientation of inanimate objects in the 19th century, and in the computing sense in theoretical work during the 1910s.

- portion, amount, quantity, measure, any quota of a substance administered for some purpose;
- exercise, drill, an activity done as practice or training;
- set, a fixed number of repetitions of a particular exercise performed as a unit

Etymology: originally in the first sense, a semi-learned borrowing from Late Latin dosis "dose", itself from Greek δόσις • dósis "gift, portion; dose". The word's extension to other measured quantities is seen in the Middle Borlish period. The latter senses originate in the military slang of the late nineteeth century, spreading into civilian use amid body-building fads during the twentieth.

202.2: Lexember 2025 - 30: rancheyar "set"

rancheyar /ranˈkjar/ [ʀɐŋˈkjɐː]
- array, lay out, to put into an orderly arrangement (especially to form into rows);
- deploy, marshal, to cause (e.g. troops) to be in some particular formation;
- serialise, order, sequence, to cause to be in the form of an ordered list spread out over time or space;
- set, arrange, to organise (type) for printing a page

Etymology: Middle Borlish, verbal derivative of ranc "row, ordered line; rank, caste". This was borrowed from Old French rang, ranc "position", itself from a descendant either of Classical German rhingas "ring, circle" or of rancas "straight, upright". Extension from the verb to senses involving arrangements other than into literal rows is seen in the early modern period; in the printing sense it appears in the sixteenth century.

202.3: Lexmber 2025 - 31: se corruð "set"

se corruð /se kɔˈrɪθ/ [se kʊˈʀɪθ]
- sitting pretty, made in the shade, set for life, living on easy street, having a comfortable or certain supply of money or resources;
- made, set, happy, having removed any obstacles and anticipating smooth sailing from here on in;
- in the clear, home free, out of the woods, past the hard slog and properly equipped for future challenges;
- bulletproof, watertight, on solid ground, having made oneself completely secure;
- ready, prepared, good to go, locked and loaded, shipshape, having sorted out any issues and fully able to proceed

Etymology: past participle of se corrir "make it, survive, get through, succeed", the reflexive of corrir "run". This descends directly from Latin currō "I run". Idiomatic use of this phrase is seen from the fifteenth century poetry of Manuel Kigman. The phrase appears to have originally referred to simply being well-off or comfortable; semantic association with the verb has more recently given the idiom connotations of past struggle and present battle-readiness.

Posc resoum nos y fastig, nos arreu se corruð contrell'yarn.

- piece of the action, foot in the door, an opportunity to take part in some activity;
- percentage, cut, commission, share, a portion of the monetary (or otherwise) gains produced by some venture

Etymology: idiom from the early modern period, literally meaning "bite at a carrot". The phrase was coined by the poet Bautrmeu as the title of her 1654 compendium of works. The word mornç "bite" is a noun from verb mordr "bite", which descends from Latin mordeō "I bite"; the word morn "carrot" was borrowed in the Old Borlish period from Old English moran, plural of more "carrot, parsnip".

Casc toun ajos son un mornç a morn flagitant.

…variously also named golden beet, gilt beet, manegold, sweetbeet, is a variety of beet (plant ✾2.1.17.1) which is characterised by the golden flesh and high sugar content of its root. Cultivation of braxoch beet is responsible for a significant fraction of sugar production in many temperate polities: as of 2025 it originated over four parts in five of sugar consumed everywhere on Albion. 

The name braxoch first enters the Merch language in the 1740s, via Borlish and Polish from Cassuvian braxoch "fine beet", an augmentative of brac "beet", which reflects Medieval Latin borāgō "borage" (further origin disputed).

History

The Willem [~NE France, NW Germany, Benelux] botanist Tewis Camigner, who was active during the Revitalist period in the sixteenth century, offers the first surviving written sources noting the high sugar content of beet, describing the billrod [cochineal red] hue and sweetness of a syrup he extracted from natural beets. However, the low concentration of sugar (perhaps one part in eighty) and the presence of other untasteful substances in the syrup made it no substitute for the sugarcane increasingly cultivated in the Novomund [Americas] over the following two centuries.

This changed with the Pentrose survey of the 1730s. Borland having recently been severely limited in its access to Novomundine trade, the state coordinated with the University of Pentrose to locate productive or otherwise useful cultivars of many plants. The survey's crowning glory was the development of the braxoch, which seems to have been a hybrid of Silesian and Cassuvian stock. 

Alchemy

The golden colour and high sugar content of the braxoch beet are intimately connected. The clause [gene] which instructs beet to produce its red pigments is located in the same heredian volume [chromosome] (volume II), very near a clause regarding the production of a sugar tinderbox [enzyme]. It is believed that beet breeding led to miscopying of this volume which simultaneously broke the red pathway (causing yellow pigments to predominate) and triggered a much higher rate of sugar production in the root.

Altering volume II also led to a thinner, more brittle skin, which would usually leave such beet more vulnerable to fungal infection during growth (partially explaining, in an Iscovalian sense, why this presentation is absent in the wild). However, braxoch beet exhibits another, independent alteration; it produces a non-functional iron marker [sensor]. This causes it to remain stuck in a low-iron regime, producing a much higher concentration of oromarynx [riboflavin; vitamin B₂], a yellow-orange substance and aqueous essence [water-soluble vitamin]. Oromarynx, which gleams under surblavic [UV] light, also has counterzoic [anti-microbial] properties which are activated by exposure to such light.

Hence, alterations which are individually costly become…

203.2: cug "fall"

cug /kaj/ [kaj]
- fall, drop, descent, motion downward;
- decrease, decline, reduction, the lessening of a value;
- downfall, defeat, loss, doom, an (especially precipitous) erosion of status;
- slide, flume, chute, slope, a structure along which things are made to travel from a higher to a lower position;
- (poetic) passing, death, the end of a person's life;
- (legal) nullification, repeal, the act of invalidating something (especially an act of law);
- (specifically) annulment, the dissolution of a marriage on the grounds that it was never formally valid

Etymology: descendant of Old Borlish cauȝ, cuȝ /kaˈyɣ ~ kyɣ/ "fall, descent", which reflects Latin adjective cadūcus "falling; doomed; futile; (law) lapsed". The word is seen in metaphorical use almost at once; for physical downward slopes it may have been influenced by Norman cute "fall; chute". Poetic and legal usages are both attested from the late Middle Borlish period.

203.3: lat "root"

lat /lat/ [lat]
- side, edge, a one-dimesional segment of the surface of a shape;
- root, a number which when raised to a given power yields a particular quantity (especially the square root);
- cusp, precipice, an abrupt boundary between two relatively smooth planes;
- verge, brink, threshold, an edge or margin before a sudden or dramatic change

Etymology: Middle Borlish, a borrowing from Latin latus "side, flank". Originally used in geometry, and extended to the arithmetic usage by analogy to the example of a square's area and side-length. Senses referring to metaphorical sudden boundaries are attested from the eighteenth century.

Y lat vorpal de cinq cent e doç val ogt.
/i lat vɔrˈpal de tsɪnk tsɛnt e dɔts val ɔjt/

203.4: vry "prestige"

vry /vri/ [vʀi]
- prestige, status, cachet, fame, esteem, the state of being well-thought-of by people;
- power, influence, the ability to effect one's will or to have people consider one an authority;
- kudos, acclaim, accolades, praise, credit for one's achievements

Etymology: nineteenth-century borrowing from a lenited form of Welsh bri "prestige, honour". This descends from pre-Classical Kelt brīgos "importance, weight", though to be cognate with Latin gravis "heavy". Originally a somewhat déclassé slang term, the word had passed into the ordinary register by the mid-twentieth century. A brief period of use as a approbatory interjection was over outside ironic mimicry by the 1980s.

203.5: Through the Ages 2

more collected notes on a variety of background figures in Boralverse history, listed in chronological order.

Nadàlla fi Carol was an influential figure in the early years of the city of Santrafew [~Boston, MA], one of the first trading posts in Mendeva [NA] established by Provence. She was raised as the eldest daughter of town reverend Carol Zancoud, and as an adult she helped to author the 1621 Becouin Treaty which defined the amicable relationship of the traders with the local Mastòiset [Massachusett] people for several decades. She is rumoured to have carried on an affair with the runaway heir to the Avosche duchy in her youth, although she makes no mention of such a relationship in her surviving diaries.

Dorothe Shock was the original proprietress of the De Marnoshring emporium in the early nineteenth century, which over the following two hundred years would become a quasipolitic guild [multinational corporation] controlling much of the market for children's toys and various material hobbies. She ran a store in the Saxon city of Miszen [Meissen], originally alone but from 1813 alongside her younger brother.

Agathe Bisset (d. 2025) was a French politician and author. Born in Blois during the latter years of the Drengot Collusion, she held various background positions in parliaments of France in the decades following its dissolution, only attaining wider recognition via her works of popular fiction from the 1990s onward. Her most successful work, 2003's Hommes en Noir (Men in Black), chronicles stories of spycraft and espionage from ancient times to the modern day; her mother's alleged position as a mid-century spy at the Ministry for Information may have been the source for some of Bisset's more recent accounts.

204.2: quil çaveyour "feather bed"

quil çaveyour /kwɪl tsaˈvjur/ [kwɪl tsɐˈvjʊː]
- feather bed, a soft mattress filled with down;
- (metonymically) easy street, comfort, well-being, security, the concept of a comfortable life;
- mod con, amenity, some device or feature that makes one's life more convenient

Etymology: phrase attested from the early modern period, literally "cushioner bed". This is an early example of a compound-forming construction, much more prevalent in the modern language, which uses agent nouns as modifiers. The noun quil "bed" descends directly via Old Borlish quil, coil "bed, cot" from Latin cubīle "bed, couch; lair, kennel"; the verb çaveyar "cushion, soften; sugarcoat, sanitise" is a derivative of çaveyal "pillow", descending from synonymous cervīcal in Latin. Use as a mascot for easy living is seen from the nineteenth century, and has persisted likely due to its use in some evergreen folk songs.

Jo dout ouð y quil çaveyour vel lou incombir.
/ʒo dut uθ i kwɪl tsaˈvjur vɛl lu ˌɪn.kɔmˈbɪr/

204.3: alant a haun "homecoming"

alant a haun /aˈlant a hon/ [ɐˈlant a hon]
- landfall, the end of a sea voyage;
- homecoming, the act of returning to one's home;
- (by extension) safe habour, deliverance, sanctuary, respite, the attaining of a position of safety after an extended period of danger or uncertainty

Etymology: collocation originating in Kigman's fifteenth-century poetry, literally meaning "docking at a haven". The noun alant "landfall" is a deverbal from alandar "arrive, turn up, dock"; this was borrowed in the Old Borlish period from Old English ġelendan "approach, arrive". The noun haun "haven, port" was borrowed from Old Norse hǫfn "harbour".

The phrase was used by Kigman already to mean a return to a metaphorical homeland; it had become synonymous with safe places more generally by the end of the following century.

Nos coum alant a haun posc tan semman.
/nɔz kum aˈlant a hon pɔx tan sɛˈman/

204.4: ne traiscn "late"

ne traiscn /ne trex.n̩/ [ne ˈtʀe.xɐn]
- slow, behind, (of a timepiece) showing a time earlier than the true time;
- late, delayed, occurring after the scheduled time due to unforeseen events or inefficiencies;
- laggy, buffering, responding slowly due to high latency

Etymology: originally horological jargon used by clockmakers, attested from the seventeenth century, literally "in lag". The noun traiscn "lag, delay" is a deverbal from traiscnar "trail, drag behind, lag", which reflects a Vulgar Latin verb traxinō "I drag, pull, tug" which extends the verb trahō in Classical Latin. The word has been extended from clocks to public transportation and then to computing in the modern era.

205.2: harvougl "earwig"

harvougl /harˈvujl/ [hɐːˈvwɪl]
- earwig, any of various winged insects with elongated bodies and rear-pointing pincers;
- earbud, a small speaker placed into the ear canal;
- (intelligence) handler, someone at a base who remotely directs an intelligence asset in the field

Etymology: originally in the first sense, from Old Borlish horvoȝl, erveȝl "earwig". Thought to be partially from Vulgar Latin forficula "small scissors", diminutive of forfex "scissors", and partially from Old English ēarwicgel "earwig". The development of the initial consonant is unexplained, but compare Vascon horveix "earwig". Folklore connecting the insect to ear-burrowing influenced the modern senses, first attested in the twentieth century.

- entertainer, performer, one who puts on a show for an audience;
- crowdpleaser, someone or something that is (reliably) entertaining for an audience

Etymology: nineteenth century, agentive derivation from verb vrollir "please, entertain, cheer, gladden". This itself is a backformation from noun vrollisc "entertainment, fun", borrowed in the early modern period from a Willem or Saxon Dutch adjective like vrolic, frolich "merry, cheerful". In the modern period, when referring to a person, the word often denotes someone who has an online audience.

- electrify, charge, to power by means of electricity;
- galvanise, energise, thrill, excite, to render delighted or eagerly anticipatory;
- shock, zap, to cause electricity to pass through (as to cause pain or death)

Etymology: nineteenth century, verbal derivative with the causative suffix -eyar < Latin -idiō, -izō "I make _" from adjective barric "electric" (formerly also a noun, now displaced by astraphor "electricity", from Greek). This in turn entered Borlish during the previous century, originating in Arabic رْق • barq "lightning". In metaphorical or emotional use the word is attested almost at once.

205.5: The Alphabet

excerpt from near the end of the Concise Onomatory o'Merch (sixth edition), a reference work published in 2001 and compiled by the Utcheter Lexical Association.

…a clouded wine fermented from rice, brewed across Asia from northeastern Hind [India] to Nivon [Japan]. Around 1700 as zito < Napolitan zito, zuto "rice wine" < Tenivian [Angami] ʐúthó. Respelt in the nineteenth century in line with the possible cognate in Greek ζῦθος • (zûthos) "an Egyptian barley beer".

Afterwords

1. Th'Alphabet

a ba ce dy e ef ge,
hake i jot, kea el em;
en o pa qua ro es te
u va win, ex wy zed.

The letter names in Merch are a mixture, some descending from Old English futhork runes and others from Old Northern French names for the Latin letters.

The vowels a e i o u [/ɛː iː əi uː jəw/] reflect Latin; four from early Merch long vowels [/aː eː iː oː/] and the last from the adaptation of ONFr [/y/] to [/juː/]. The name of the half-vowel y [/wəi/] is of unclear origin, but usually supposed to be a combination of the names of u and i (compare ONFr ui and modern Borlish oy "Y").

The inverted names ef el em en es [/ɛf ɛl ɛm ɛn ɛs/] come via ONFr from Latin, unusual for ending with their associated sound instead of starting with it. The names of kea ex zed [/kɛː ɛks zɛd/] also come from Latin for lack of any corresponding rune (although some scholars suggests that the ill-attested elhs "elks" rune may have contributed to "X").

Other borrowings via ONFr from Latin are ce ge hake te [/siː dʒiː hɛːk tiː/]; alternatively, the name for "T" may stem from a rebracketing of tue < OE tiw as te + u due to the following u in the alphabet.

Descendants of OE futhorc include dy ro win [/dəi roː wɪn/] < OE dæg rād wynn. The "R" name showcases final-consonant deletion, which also happened to ba pa qua [/baː paː kwaː/] < OE berc perþ cƿerþ in the early modern period as a form of regularisation.

The final two letters are jot and va [/dʒɔt vaː/]; the first is an early Merch borrowing via Latin iōta from Greek ιῶτα • (iôta) "iota" used to distinguish the consonant j from the vowel i, and the second is an alteration of earlier vaw (likely by rebracketing with the following win) borrowed in the early modern period via Latin vau from (presumed) Greek ϝαῦ • (waû) "waw".

206.2: aðaun "as one"

aðaun /aˈðon/ [ɐˈðon]
- (archaic, poetic or dialect) as one, together, at the same time or place or doing the same thing;
- (legal) in agreement, united, unanimous, without any dissent;
- in unison, in chorus, tutti, acting together in e.g. playing music or singing;
- (interjection) let's go, now, an exhortation to simultaneous action

Etymology: descendant of Old Borlish aðaun, extended variant of synonymous aun "together, at the same time". This comes either from a Late Latin phrase ad ūnum "at one" or from a deverbal of adūnō "I unite". Current in the language until the early modern period, it has fossilised in legal and musical uses; the interjection appears to have been reborrowed in the twentieth century from rural dialects that retained the term.

206.3: çondr "pendant"

çondr /ˈtsɔn.dr̩/ [ˈtsɔn.dɐ]
- pendant, a piece of jewellery which hangs down as an ornament (as attached to a necklace or earring);
- locket, such an ornament which can be opened to store some item of sentimental value;
- charm, amulet, bead, medallion, trinket, a small item attached to e.g. a bracelet especially as having notional protective properties

Etymology: Middle Borlish, via contemporary French from Tuscan ciondolo "pendant, charm". This is a deverbal from ciondolare "dangle, swing", which is thought to reflect a Vulgar Latin exundulō "I sway", from unda "wave". The Borlish term has broadened to cheaper and less precious ornaments than its cognates in other languages.

- retrieval, recovery, restoration, return, salvage, the act of getting something back that was lost;
- rescue, salvation, liberation, relief, delivery, the saving of something or someone from danger;
- redemption, reformation, changing of one's character for the better

Etymology: Middle Borlish, deverbal from errevir "rescue". This reflects Old Borlish erever, erevre "save, redeem", from Latin ēripiō "I set free; I remove", related to rapiō "I grab, seize". In early use the term often had religious connotations, referring to the redemption of the world by Jesus Christ.

206.5: The Scathe of Saint Sophia

excerpted from 2014 popular history textbook The Fourth Burning of London, and other Screwups: the Eventful History of Things Going Wrong, written in collaboration with the Faculty of Domain History at the University of Huzatre [~Bayonne] by writer (formerly and more famously of historical lovetales) Galarça fi Molhomé, who undertook her studies there.

…by Nicolà sAvignon, who in the fourteenth century led the renovation and expansion of Saint Sophia's Cathedral [the Hagia Sophia] in Stamboul [Istanbul], which had stood mostly unchanged since its construction in the sixth century during Justinian I's reign. It has been suggested that the expansion was commissioned in order to cement the cathedral as the largest one in all Christendom; challengers in Valencia and Augsburg were in the process of being built at that time that would have surpassed it if not for sAvignon's redesign.

There is a popular theory that sAvignon is responsible for the Scathe of Saint Sophia—despite the fact that this calamitous building collapse (which killed Emperor Theosthenes, much of his family, and dozens of dignitaries) occurred in 1651 N, over three hundred years after his reconstruction project was completed. The theory appears to have originated in 1890 via Jordan hixPasqual's popular history work The Last Years of the Last Roman Empire, in which he contends with little evidence that sAvignon employed experimental and faulty techniques in reinforcing the great central dome of the cathedral, weakening the structure over the centuries until the eventual disaster.

Of course, it is difficult to know which precise modifications were made to the cathedral in the 1340s, but most historians agree that the bulk of the changes were in extending the complex, not rebuilding supports. Nonetheless, the dramatic quality of the Scathe of Saint Sophia, along with the narrative that it led directly to the Empire's final collapse less than a decade later, have led this theory to become…

The Blue Trans-Willem War was one of a series of wars in the early modern period which principally involved French and Dutch [German] polities (that is, those powers located on either side of the territory of Willemy [~Benelux, Lorraine]) and which were de facto waged over control of said territory.

Though the sporadic flare-ups of hostilies are difficult to divide into discrete wars without some arbitrariness, modern historiography usually works with the chromatic periodisation of nineteenth-century writer Andrysk de Santer.

Her system, based either (depending on the account) on the colours of the victors' standards or on alchemical symbolism, has the Blue war as the penultimate conflict, ending in the late seventeenth century.

Some historians, though not de Santer, have classified the Blue war as part of the broader collection of Romantic Wars of the mid-seventeenth century.

207.2: gouth "pushup"

gouth /guθ/ [guθ]
- pushup, press-up, a bodyweight exercise resting on hands and toes and pushing away from the floor;
- bounce back, comeback, rally, a return to form after some sort of setback;
- rebound, a romantic partner one dates in order to get over the end of a relationship

Etymology: late nineteenth century, during an early instance of the many physical exercise fads of the modern period. The term was borrowed from Welsh gwth "push, thrust, shove". The metaphorical uses (principally in gouth dar "to make a comeback, to attempt to get over someone by dating; lit. to give pushups") are seen from the 1970s.

T'orruð ou le day gouth cosogr mey?

207.3: nougl "distaff"

nougl /nujl/ [nwɪl]
- distaff, a device storing natural fibres to be spun;
- spinneret, the organ with which a spider spins its web;
- spinning, fibrecraft, the art of making things like textiles or rope;
- (regional, poetic) cattail, teasel, mullein, foxtail, or various other herbs and reeds with distaff-shaped flower spikes or seedheads

Etymology: from late Old Borlish noȝl "distaff". This is though to conflate two earlier forms: (1) conoȝl "distaff" < synonymous conucula in Late Latin, dissimilatory derivative of Classical colus "distaff"; (2) rocle "distaff" < synonymous rokkill in Old Norse. Dialects differ greatly on which particular plants may be referred to by this term; its meaning is not clarified by its indiscriminate use in poetry.

L'oç mersc verdeya de nougl spinous.

207.4: yedic "vinegar"

yedic /jeˈdɪk/ [ʝɪˈdɪk]
- vinegar, a sour liquid formed from the fermentation of alcohol;
- acetic acid, the principal acidic component of vinegar;
- (attributive) irritable, narky, testy, responding nastily to any interaction

Etymology: descendant of Old Borlish iedic, edic "vinegar", borrowed from synonymous edic in Old Dutch. This is apparently a metathetic variant coming from late Classical German aceda, acita "vinegar", a borrowing from Latin acētum "vinegar" possibly influenced by related acidus "sour". The Borlish word is attested as an adjective in the modern sense from as early as the twelfth century.

208.2: a to-rutto "single file"

a to-rutto /a ˌto.rɪˈto/ [ɐˌto.ʀɪˈto]
- single file, in a line or queue one person wide;
- in a row, sequentially, one after another, successively, located in a linear span across space or time;
- one at a time, individually, occurring in discrete instances

Etymology: attested in various forms since the late Middle Borlish period, an ideophonic idiom used to refer to single-file sorts of arrangement or motion. The phrase is hypothesised to originate in farmers' livestock-counting numerals, which may be reflected by the modern appearance of to-rutto in counting-style nursery rhymes. These rural tally-like systems (e.g. an, to, ry, bo, bum, ...), which are present across Borland, derive from Germanic or Celtic numbers.

Veleð aular a to-rutto lonc y forcul.

208.3: lon theu "accidentally"

lon theu /lɔn θau/ [lɔn θau]
- idly, carelessly, thoughtlessly, mindlessly, unintentionally, without much or any conscious drive;
- accidentally, by accident, by mistake, happening due to some misapprehension or lack of knowledge;
- by chance, unexpectedly, coincidentally, spontaneously, for no apparent reason

Etymology: phrase meaning "without will", attested from the Old Borlish period. The preposition lon "without, lacking" is thought to descend from Latin adverb longē "far away, for a long time". The noun theu "will, habit" was borrowed in the Old Borlish period from Old English þēaw "wont, behaviour". Extension to happenstances and mistakes is seen from the early modern period.

Y stuðant er y scaumel maneyant lon theu.

208.4: foyer figr "settle down"

foyer figr /fɔˈjɛr ˈfaj.r̩/ [fʊˈʝɛː ˈfa.jɐ]
- put down roots, settle down, to establish a long-lasting home in a particular community (especially via marriage and children);
- take root, take hold, to become established in some form

Etymology: idiom from the early modern period, literally "to set (a) hearth down". The noun foyer "hearth, fireplace; (fig.) homestead" is a direct descendant of Vulgar Latin focārium "hearth", an extension of synonymous focus in Classical Latin. The verb figr "put down, lay, place" reflects Latin fīgō "I fasten, fix".

209.2: cirteyar "peddle"

cirteyar /tsɪrˈtjar/ [tsɪːˈtjɐː]
- peddle, hawk, solicit, flog, to travel around (e.g. from door to door) in order to sell;
- (archaic) sojourn, itinerate, peregrinate, tour, to travel from place to place;
- (reflexive) importune, bother, pester, mither, disturb, to harass with e.g. persistent requests;
- (reflexive) come on to, proposition, to make amorous advances

Etymology: originally in the first sense, an extension from early old Borlish ceȝrtar "peddle, itinerate" with a causative suffix. This in turn descends from Late Latin circitō "I peddle, frequent", from circō "I traverse, wander through". In reflexive use the word is attested from the early modern period.

Mame me dis de plu luy me cirteyar.

209.3: encromnar "scarf"

encromnar /ˌɛn.krɔmˈnar/ [ˌɛŋ.kʀʊmˈnɐː]
- pocket, to put into a pouch or pocket;
- stow, put away, lodge, to place something in a space-saving manner;
- (slang) wolf, scoff, scarf, to eat (especially an impressive amount or with impressive speed)

Etymology: Middle Borlish, verbal derivation from cromn "pocket, purse, small bag". This descends uncomplicatedly from Latin crumena "pouch for carrying money". Metaphorical extension of this word is seen from the fifteenth century; in the slang sense it most recently became popular in recent decades.

Y soldart encromnn mansc com louf famiscent.
/i sɔlˈdart ɛnˈkrɔm.nn̩ manx kɔm luf ˌfa.miˈxɛnt/

209.4: protagoneyar "star in"

protagoneyar /proˌta.goˈnjar/ [pʀʊˌta.gʊˈnjɐː]
- star in, lead, to be or perform as the main character of (a piece of media);
- dominate, predominate, drive, to be the main factor or influence in (some process or condition);
- to be the main topic of conversation during (a period of time), often of people involved in viral events or scandal

Etymology: nineteenth century, verbal derivative based on the noun protagonist "lead actor, dominating factor". This is an early modern borrowing via Scholastic Latin from Greek πρωταγωνιστής • (prōtagōnistḗs) "lead actor". The word is attested in non-dramatic usage from the early twentieth century.

Jo le memour noc cu protagoney l'oç lasc.

210.2: çut "battery"

çut /tsɪt/ [tsɪt]
- cell, battery, a device used to power electronic equipment which maintains a potential difference between two contacts;
- (by extension) any notional store of physical or mental energy;
- reserves, stockpile, assets set aside for contingencies;
- potential, capacity, a person's yet-untapped ability or resources

Etymology: eighteenth century, borrowed from Vascon çut "waterwheel, weir; electric battery"; the latter sense was clipped from earlier çut barric "electric weir", cells being seen as analogous stores of useful work. This in turn is a rebracketed form of original açut "waterwheel, dam", which is allied with Leon açud and Portingale açude; it was borrowed from Arabic السُّدّ • as-sudd "the dam, the dike".

La brouc un çut tal plen cas music.

210.3: time "qualm"

time /tiˈme/ [tɪˈme]
- qualm, misgiving, reservation, scruple, doubt, a feeling of unease or uncertainty regarding a course of action;
- timidity, shyness, diffidence, self-effacement, a lack of courage or confidence; 
- con, disadvantage, drawback, a weakness or undesirable feature of something

Etymology: derived from earlier adjective time "doubtful; shy, timid", a borrowing from Scholastic Latin timeus "frightened, cowrdly". This comes from the root verb timeō "I fear, I am afraid". The word is seen as a noun from the seventeenth century, and as a disadvantageous quality of something (as opposed to something felt by a person) since the mid-nineteenth century.

Me stove y vajot eð y time grindr.

210.4: mogn "low"

mogn /mɔjn/ [mɔjn]
- low, low down, situated close to the ground;
- short, squat, having little vertical extent (esp compared to other dimensions);
- trifling, trivial, petty, of no particular importance;
- silly, unserious, provoking amusement through foolishness

Etymology: direct descendant of Old Borlish mogne /moɲə/ "low down", of disputed further origin. Probably not related to Old French moins "less", despite use of the word in parallel comparative constructions in dialectal modern Borlish. The most secure lead is Kernish [Breton] monn "oaf", connected with Old French moing "someone mutilated" to a proposed Gaulish munniō "blunt", although the semantics are somewhat tenuous.

Jo cogleu l'aujon des y tabr mogn.

211.2: a tug "for fun"

a tug /a taj/ [a taj]
- for fun, for the love of the game, done for one's own enjoyment or other intrinsic desire to do so;
- friendly, penny-ante, (of a game) without serious stakes;
- voluntarily, intentionally, by one's own free will;
- (conjunction) so that, in order to, with a desire to bring about (some result)

Etymology: Middle Borlish idiom, literally "to passion". The noun tug "passion, fervour, enthusiasm" descends from Old Borlish tuȝ "inclination, impulse, drive". This was borrowed from Old English tyge "a pull, a draw", which is related to the verb tēon "pull, drag, lead". As a conjunction (attested from the sixteenth century) the construction requires someone's explicit agency in a way which the near-synonyms por and a fin do not.

Masctig por cors a tug teyen boncop.

211.3: lon mensc "dishonourable"

lon mensc /lɔn ˈmɛnx/ [lɔm ˈmɛŋx]
- (military) dishonourable, due to conduct that is considered reprehensible;
- without a reference, without a character, not being entitled to an employer's testimony when applying to a new job;
- (by extension) cold turkey, abruptly and without consideration for comfort

Etymology: originally in legal expressions such as destourm lon mensc "dishonourable discharge", the phrase literally means "without honour". The preposition lon "without" reflects Latin longē "far away"; the archaic noun mensc "honour; mercy; courtesy; decorum" was borrowed in the Old Borlish period from Old Norse mennska "humanity". Extension to non-miltary and non-employment contexts occurred in the mid-twentieth century.

L'es attenent a caffay salir lon mensc.
/lɛz ˌa.teˈnɛnt a kaˈfe saˈlɪr lɔn mɛnx/

211.4: haval fair "play pretend"

haval fair /haˈval fer/ [hɐˈval feː]
- play pretend, make believe, role-play, to engage in imaginative activity;
- feign, dissemble, put on an act, to perform insincerely;
- go through the motions, to do something perfunctorily or without conviction

Etymology: idiom from the sixteenth century, literally "do dolls". The noun haval "doll, puppet" was originally a southern dialect term out of Pentrose, borrowed in the Middle Borlish period from Welsh haval "likeness, image; doll, effigy". Extension out of the realm of childhood play is seen from the nineteenth century.

Y joun ern haval fayent ny gardin.

212.2: routuron "commoner"

routuron /ˌru.tiˈrɔn/ [ˌʀu.tɪˈʀɔn]
- commoner, plebeian, proletarian, a citizen who holds no noble title or rank;
- (with plural agreement) hoi polloi, masses, rank and file, people considered as opposed to the elite

Etymology: Middle Borlish derivative of routur "vulgarity, working-class quality" (compare late Medieval Latin ruptūrō "freeman"), which originally referred to a small quantity of land as might be granted to or owned by a common farming household. This descends from Latin ruptūra "fracture, rupture, breach; (later) a division of land". Outside of historical texts, the term is usually metaphorical or jocular.

212.3: quoncein "young adulthood"

quoncein /kwɔnˈtsin/ [kwʊnˈtsin]
- (strictly) twenties, the decade when a person is aged between 20 and 29 inclusive;
- young adulthood, a nebulous period of one's life which follows childhood and lasts approximately a decade;
- prime, trial run, Arcadia, a period in the existence of something which has any of various similarities to a person's young adulthood (the precise sense depending heavily on the speaker)

Etymology: twentieth-century calque of Willem quonzerád "young adulthood", an abstract derivation from southern dialect quonze "twenty" (standard twinte); the second element was replaced with the Borlish suffix -ein denoting a number of years (as in dezein "decade", carantein "a period of forty years"), which descends from Latin -ennium "years". Metaphorical extension of the word usually refers either to inexperience and naïveté or to a pinnacle of performance and flourishing.

La passau y quoncein par y Novomond aðendrar.
/la paˈso i kwɔnˈtsin par i ˌno.voˈmɔnd ˌa.ðɛnˈdrar/

212.4: benoyour "medium"

benoyour /ˌbe.nɔˈjur/ [ˌbe.nʊˈʝʊː]
- medium, spiritualist, a person who attempts communication with the dead;
- shaman, witch doctor, a member of a community representing or speaking for the spiritual realm and often also acting as a healer

Etymology: agentive derivation from now-obsolete benoïr "to receive blessings; (specifically) to receive communications from the deceased". This verb was formed in the early Middle Borlish period by analogy with bendigr "to bless" (itself obsolete by parallel beneïr, both from Latin benedīcō "I commend, praise; I bless") from the root oïr "to hear" < Latin audiō "I hear". The word enjoyed some use in lay Christian practice before dropping out of use in the Revitalist period of the early sixteenth century; it was revived in reference to non-Christian roles as well as to rites of the Novomundine "Prodigal Faiths" during the nineteenth century.

dragoman /ˌdra.goˈman/ [ˌdʀa.gʊˈman]
- interpreter, translator, a person who translates speech to enable people without common languages to communicate;
- communicator, PR person, someone whose job is to convey technical information to the public;
- broker, mediator, middleman, intermediary, a person who liaises between two or more parties in order to achieve some outcome (especially the buying and selling of goods)

Etymology: originally in the first senses and in particular with reference to interpreters of Arabic and Turk languages. The word was borrowed in the Middle Borlish period via Latin from Malchassian Greek δραγομάνος (dragomános) "interpreter"; this in turn came via Arabic and Syriac from Acadian 𒅴𒁄 (targumannum) "interpreter". Later semantic development was influenced by the suffix -man "-monger; seller, shop".
