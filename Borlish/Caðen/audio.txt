Boral is a Romance language spoken on an island in the North Sea, west of Denmark, about twice the land area of Wales.

Boral is broadly SVO or V2; the word order of a sentence containing a simple verb is

- subject verb (object) (obliques),

whereas for a compound verb (an auxiliary with a participle or infinitive) it is

- subject auxiliary (object) verb (obliques).

The subject is mandatory, except for certain impersonal verbs. If the object is a pronoun, it always comes immediately before the main verb.

In the noun phrase, demonstratives and numerals precede the noun, while adjectives follow it. The demonstrative particles oc, ig, eç and ci (this, that, these, those) denote number and proximity, although they are used more often than English equivlance.

Verbs have a stem formed from removing the infinitive ending -ar or -r. They have two participles: a present participle in -nt /-nt/, and a past participle usually in -ð /-θ/. The verb forms relevant to the text are found among the following.
- 3p past imperfect: -an, -en /-an, -ɛn/
- sg past preterite: -au, -eu, -oy /-om, -awm, -ɔim/
- 1p past preterite: -aum, -eum, -oim /-om, -awm, -ɔim/
- 1p past subjunctive: -ausseu, -eusseu, -oisseu /-oˈsaw, -awˈsaw, -ɔiˈsaw/

Relative clauses are formed as shown:
the man who loves me = "the man loving me" y segr m'amant
the man who I love = "the man loved by me" y segr meyon amað

The prepositions a, de interact with a following definite article y to give ag, dy. Before a vowel these become all', dell'.
