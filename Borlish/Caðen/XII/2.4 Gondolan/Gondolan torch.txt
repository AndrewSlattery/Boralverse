Gondolan is a largely (mixed) head-marking language with SVO word order, where the more animate noun tends to be the subject.

It’s important to note that when a morpheme is glommed onto a head, certain vowel sandhi processes are undergone. It’s unlikely that a sandhi key will be needed for this, but if needed I can send one.

Also useful to know, Gondolan has no word for “and”. It simply just strings two clauses together.

Gondolan has no dedicated adjectives, but some nouns can pattern like them. “Adjectives” come before their head noun.
