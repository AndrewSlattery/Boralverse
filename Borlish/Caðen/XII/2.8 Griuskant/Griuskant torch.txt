[Trigger mechanics in griuskant]
* All triggers are backwards-facing.
* The stateparameters of the triggers are: active=FORWARD, passive=REVERSE and circumstantial=SINK (aka indirect object or dative).
* All triggers are short-ranged, so they usually have a range of 1 phrase. Also, they do not seek any other (null) markers.
* All triggers are generally unidirectional, but the circumstantial trigger as well as the anti-trigger can be bidirectional.
* All triggers are susceptible to interruptions. The most stablised is the circumstantial trigger, however its forward-redirection function could be interrupted and thus be deactivated by an anti-trigger.
