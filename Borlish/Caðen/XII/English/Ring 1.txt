Ring 1
Jackk:
By the time I manage to slip away from the revolving crowd and step out into the back street, the cloudless sky has lost all trace of pink and is fading directly to a navy blue. The first stars twinkle cold above; it is half an hour until moonrise. 
In that time I have to find the emeralds, pass them on to my sister, rejoin the party carrying everything else I could steal from the baron's vault, scatter his valuables onto the dance floor, and escape into the night.
My sister really ought to pick easier marks.

Salmoneus:
When I accomplished my escape, unrecognised, from the swirling crowd
and turned from my path into an alley
the last red stain had then already departed (never to return) the blue clouds
and directly they had been bleached with black woad
the first of the stars was sparkling coldly up above
and it was only a half hour until the moon's rising
before then, I needed to find those emeralds
in order to set them into my sister's palms
that I might go back into that party
carrying all that was easy to snatch from the jarl's treasure-chamber
in order to strew his precious things onto the floor of the dance area
and to escape in the cloak of night -
truly, my sister ought to give me easier targets

Click:
I made my way out of the swirling mass without being noticed and turned away from the path after the farther-off red spot had moved away from the blue clouds, and the dark blue had become faded. At first, it sparkled up there as cold as a star and for half an hour there was nothing outside but the rising moon.
I needed to find the emeralds to put them in my sister’s palms, so I had to go back to the party. Stealing everything from the nobleman’s treasure chest was easy, but his precious things got strewn all over the dance hall’s floor, and I had to escape under night’s cover—my sister could have really given me an easier task.

brblues:
I left without anybody seeing me sneak out of the swirling mass, then I turned to get away from the footpath after a red speck appeared from further way behind the clouds, turning blue, then darkening and fading. It first sparkled cold-white above like a star; half an hour passed, and nothing but the moon rose outside. I had to put it into my cupped hands and give it to my sister, and thus I needed to go to the party. Stealing everything from the chest of valuables had been easy, but in falling the valuables has been scattered over the dance room floor; thus I had to flee under the cover of darkness. My sister had given me many easier tasks.

cedh:
With nobody seeing me, I sneaked away from the swirling mass. They left, and I disappeared as a red dot in the herd of clouds somewhere far away, turning blue, becoming dark, and when they faded, I left the path.
At first, it was sparkling cold white like a star. With half an hour passing, only the moon outside rose in the sky.
I needed to collect them into my cupped pair of hands, and because I needed to give them to my sister, I needed to go to the party. It was easy to steal a full pile of things from the aristocrat's box, but the pile of things fell to the ground, and got scattered all over the dancefloor. Therefore I had to flee away into the sheltering night.
My sister gave me many easier tasks.

ixals:
Nobody has ever realised it before. I managed to silently leave to the side of the crowd of roaming villagers following the flow. The people continued singing and dancing for the ceremony and walking away from me and approaching the holy megalith. I hid and waited.
The sun descended hiding between the herd of clouds that were red like jewels. The sky become dark blue, cold and clear. The stars glowed like sparks, and for a small amount of time, the bright moon rose up to the sky.
I carefully came out of the shelter of the shadow. I needed to quickly look around to find the talisman for my cousin. I had to be brave and take the chance immediately, while all the people were away participating in celebrating the ritual of the spring equinox. I easily managed to discover the talisman among the magical herbs and other significant items inside the box of the priest. I seized it and covered it with my protecting hands. But as I rushed out I stumbed and the box fell down, opened and all the significant items fell out and scattered on the floor. This occurrence was very loud, therefore I had to quickly jump into the darkness around me to hide.
Since this whole mission that my cousin has given to me, each and every other one was a lot easier than this mission.

loglorn:
No one knows time.
The people walking out of the village managed to leave silently. They continued their singing and dancing ceremony. Slowly leaving, they began approaching the holy megalith, I went undercover and waited.
The sun hurried across the sky like jewels stumbling on the clouds, the sky turned blue, then dark, cold, then sunny, the stars glowed like sparks. It took little time. As the glowing moon moved up in the sky, the protection of the shadows carefully went away.
Quickly looking around, my cousin must keep searching for the helping amulet. At the holy time of the spring equinox ceremony, I must use the brave time. I easily managed to find many important things alongside the magic herbs and the amulet inside the priest's box on the ground. I took the amulet and covered it with my hands for protection but the time traveller tripped.
The box moves. It opens. Everything important left the box, splitting the earth noticeably loudly. Undercover, I looked around inside the darkness. It made me suddenly jump. My cousin's mission left time, so the present mission is noticeably easier.

DesEsseintes:
Who knows time except for me? The people walking out of the village were able to leave silently. They continued the ritual singing and dancing. Walking slowly, they drew near to the holy megalith. I was disguised and I waited. The sun quickly passed across the sky like jewels scattered through the clouds. The sky started turning dark blue in the cold sunlight. The stars appeared, glowing like sparks. It took very little time. The glowing moon rose into the sky as the protection of the shadows slowly disappeared. Looking around quickly, my cousin was eager to continue the search for the useful amulet. I wanted to bravely use the opportunity at the sacred time of the Spring Equinox ceremony. I could easily locate the important items and the herbs of the shaman with the amulet who had entered his shaman box on the ground. I took the amulet and covered it with my hands to be protected but the time traveller stumbled. The box moved. All the important items came out of the box and split open the ground with a noticeably loud sound. Still undercover, I looked at the shadows surrounding me. Suddenly, they made me jump. My cousin’s mission had left us time so this current mission was obviously easy.

anonymous123:
Who understands the passage of time if I am absent from it? The people in the village who were leaving were silent as they walked away. They continued the ceremony, as they sang and danced. As they slowly left, they carried the gods’ altar. I am wearing a mask/disguise and I am waiting. The sun moved across the sky as if it were a gem flying among the clouds. The sky was dark and blue, and the daylight was cold. The stars sparkled like sparks. They died out shortly. The moon shining in the sky rose as the shadows slowly disappeared into their dwellings. My cousin wants us to continue searching for the amulet. I want to bravely use that occasion at the spring equinox ceremony. I could easily find the important objects, and the amulet held the herbs that the shaman had and I placed it in the shaman’s box on the ground. I picked up the amulet and covered it to protect it, but the time-traveller stumbled. The box moved. All the important objects fell out of the box and the ground broke, which made a noticeably loud sound. Still wearing a mask, I saw the shadows lying around me. Suddenly they jumped up. We had time for my cousin’s mission, therefore, this mission became clear and apparent.

Frislander:
“Who does the time know that I am absent from? People in a town were silent as they went. The ceremonies continue as they were singing and dancing. The gods carried their altars as they left quietly. I am wearing a disguise and waiting. the sun moved across the sky as if it were a gem bouncing in a cloud. The skies were dark sea-blue, and the morning was cold. The stars were sparkling like they were sparks. They died shortly. The moon rose shining in the sky, as the shadows vanished in time’s house. My cousin and I wanted to continue to search for the amulet. I bravely want to use the time in the spring equinox ceremony. I am easily able to find the things that were important, and the amulet holds the priestess’ herbs, and I placed a priestess in the box. I picked up the amulet and I covered it in order that it might be protected, that the time-traveller might stumble. The box moved. All of the things that were important were leaving from out of the box and broke the earth, making a noticeably loud noise. I am still wearing a disguise, I see the shadows as they lie down around me. Suddenly they jump out. Time remained my cousin for the big task, therefore, becoming a clear and apparent mission.”

spanick:
Who sees time and am I lacking it? The quiet people leave their houses. Singers and dancers stay at the ceremonies. The gods leave holding their shrines. Covering my face, I stay. Each walk of the sun which spans the sky resembles a bounding gem in the cloud. The black sky looks like the sea on a cold morning. The sparks look like stars and quickly die. The moon joins in the shining and shadows leave time’s house. My cousin wants to look for an amulet. I could search for it with ease at the ceremony which joins daytime to nighttime. I pluck up the plucked one with ease. The medicine woman holds medicinal herbs in the amulet and set it itself. I take the amulet, cover it, I will give it protection and a time-traveler would trip. The amulet began to shake. The picked up and covered amulet leaves and shatters the world and the loud ones avoid it. Sitting, my face is covered and ai see shadows lying down and surround me. They throw themselves. My cousin is performing for the great and obvious purpose of time.

Jackk:
Who can see how little time I have left? 
People quietly leave to go home, and the singers and dancers stay at the ceremony, left with the sacred shrines. I keep my face covered as the sun rises into the sky like a gem thrown through the clouds. The cold morning sky is as dark as the sea; the stars spark and fade quickly. The moon is shining also, keeping the shadows away. 
My brother is searching for enchanted copper, which I might easily find at the Night and Day ceremony. I just pick it up where it lies, with a witch who asks for herbs alone in exchange. Having got the copper I hide it, to protect it in case a timetraveller turns up.
The copper starts vibrating, but somehow people don't notice how hidden, enchanted and earthshatteringly-loud it is! I go to cover my eyes and ears, and I see shadows on the ground all around me.
They are thrown back, by my brother's great and manifest will.
