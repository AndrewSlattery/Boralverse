Boral is a Romance language spoken on an island in the North Sea, west of Denmark, about twice the land area of Wales.


Boral is broadly SVO or V2; the word order of a sentence containing a simple verb is


* subject verb (object) (obliques),


whereas for a compound verb (an auxiliary with a participle or infinitive) it is


* subject auxiliary (object) verb (obliques).


The subject is mandatory, except for certain impersonal verbs. If the object is a pronoun, it always comes immediately before the main verb.


In the noun phrase, demonstratives and numerals precede the noun, while adjectives follow it. The particles oc, ig, eç and ci denote number and proximity, although for example “oc“ (proximal singular) is used more than English uses “this”.


Verbs have two participles: a present participle in -nt, and a past participle usually in -ð. The regular verb forms that appear in the text are:


Present
sg: -∅
3pl: -n


Recent Past
1sg: ay + past participle


Remote Past
1pl: -aum


Imperfect continuous
3pl: ern + present participle


Taken Future
1pl: voum + infinitive


Owed Future
1pl: infinitive + -eu


Relative clauses are formed as shown:
the man who loves me = “the man loving me” y segr m’amant
the man who I love = “the man loved by me” y segr meyon amað


The forms meaning “by X” are called the demoted pronouns.


The following irregular verbs appear in the text:


star
present: jo so, tu es, l’es; nos som, vos soð, il son
remote past: jo foy, tu foy, i foy; nos foim, vos foist, il foirn


revenir
subjunctive: jo revin, tu revin, i revin; nos revinau, vos revinað, il revinn


The verb suffix -br produces an adjective meaning “able to”; for example amar “to love”, amabr “lovable”.


The prepositions a “to”, de “from” and ne “in” interact with a following definite article y to give ag, dy, ny.


The construction “ne + present participle” means “while Xing”.
