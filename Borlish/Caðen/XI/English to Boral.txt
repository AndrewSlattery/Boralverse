Se poð fort parolar ny lengaç de mell’oc gent; portant, a mesur d'eç hour passant, l'oration dað par y locutour es cos stragn abject. Mell'amig fruin atorn, pu jo no so allagr. Mey e mell'amig studin dæmon, e nos trovaum un gast ojous noscon mostrað soulor ag ci thaumatorg eð ag concegl local, un cos broucabr. Jo crey l'eç autr con mey ern en pesant lontemp pos jo foy fis a l'examinar.
The language of my people can be spoken well, but as the sun crosses the sky, the speech that the orator is giving is strangely terrible. My friends are dancing around, but I am not happy. My friends and I study demons, and we found a hateful spirit that we showed to the wizards and to the village council, which was fun. I think the rest of my group were thinking about it long after I had finished looking at it.


Nos voum magn gauïr ne l'eç escapat faint accougl. Nos mancareu ig cas nous, pu nos voum stoir racontar por memorar. Vray, j'ay magn me stordið ; jo desir ig mell'audaç revin. Lonc mey l'oc camin es y camin de my prealdr : me fal my sogn malvaç carr por hugt cavir. L'ig a bel star vray, afont mey es luy desirant remanir cas mey.
We will have lots of fun going together on these adventures. We will miss our home, but we will tell stories about it, to remember. In truth I am very tired; I want my purpose back. I believe that this path is the path of my ancestors – I must search for my nightmare in order to be happy. This is true, and even so part of me wants to stay at home.
