Well, the speech of my tribe can be spoken, however, at the sun across the sky the orator of my village is weirdly bad at speaking; my friends are dancing around, but I am not happy. Me and my friends (women) study demonology, and to the group of shamans and also to the village’s gifted house and also to that hateful soul we shared until we found it, but I had fun. I believe they (women) in my group were thinking about it after I had looked at it. All of these destinations I go to with them to have lots of fun there. We will miss our home, but it will be spoken of. I am very tired. I really want my purpose back. I believe this path is the path of my ancestors. I must search for my nightmare in order to be happy. I do believe this is true, but I still miss my home.


The language of my people can be spoken well, but as the sun crosses the sky, the speech that the orator is giving is strangely terrible. My friends are dancing around, but I am not happy. My friends and I study demons, and we found a hateful spirit that we showed to the wizards and to the village council, which was fun. I think the rest of my group were thinking about it long after I had finished looking at it. 


We will have lots of fun going together on these adventures. We will miss our home, but we will tell stories about it, to remember. In truth I am very tired; I want my purpose back. I believe that this path is the path of my ancestors – I must search for my nightmare in order to be happy. This is true, and even so part of me wants to stay at home.
