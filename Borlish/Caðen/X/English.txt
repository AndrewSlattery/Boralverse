He’d never been to that restaurant, but from the name it looked expensive.
 
As he jogged at night, he saw women in luxurious clothes, men on their arms; they got out of their cars and hurried anxiously inside, their fancy dresses adorned with ribbons. He always used to pass by so he could turn his head to look at them, jogging in the street even by day, but particularly late at night in the city. He would jog on, worried and excited along with them.


Now, though, he sometimes turns away, choosing to go down the darker narrower streets, going boldly forward. Then quiet scattered footsteps and silent wandering silhouettes trouble him. Sometimes he hears a quiet retreating laugh, and trembles like a leaf.
