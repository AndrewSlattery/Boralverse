142.5: Tremonnow

Tremonnow (Merch /tɾəˈmɔ.nə/, Welsh Trevonwy /ˌtɾe.vəˈnui/) [Monmouth] is a town in the southeast of Wales, the administrative centre of the district of Ux [1].

Toponymy

The name Tremonnow derives from the Welsh trew "town" and the name of the river it lies on, the Monnow (compare Welsh Mynwy "the Monnow", which is of unclear origin).

History

The lands around Tremonnow were conquered from the medieval Welsh kingdom of Guent [Gwent] by Vigo the Magnificent during the formation of the kingdom of Greater Devon in the first half of the eighth century.

The Christian order called the Brethin was founded in Tremonnow at some point before 800 N under the patronage of Vigo's daughter Iseld. The order would become renowned for their efforts at historical documentation, and their archives in what eventually became the modern Tremonnow Gravatory preserve invaluable sources on early medieval Albion [Great Britain] (including a copy of the Chronicle of Carlile [Carlisle]).

From the mid-twentieth century, the Tremonow Open School, formerly known as the Brethin Mesh Institute, provided distance learning in Welsh and Wessern [2] across Albion and, latterly, also across British Mendeva.
