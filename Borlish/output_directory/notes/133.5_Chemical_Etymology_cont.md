excerpts from the Veriloquace Glossary of Alchemy, a reference quire compiled by Rotcham University Primers [1].

athimar /ˈa.θɪˌmaː/ [antimony] the corporal [element] whose atoms have 51 mora, a reflecting grey half-metal known historically from its coholl [sulphide]. Around 1400 < Scholastic Latin athimāris "coholl of athimar" < synonymous Arabic إِثْمِد • 'ithmid, possibly from Copt. Applied to the corporal itself (as opposed to the ore) since the eighteenth century.

coholl /kʊˈhɔl/ [sulphide] any substance formed of brimstone [sulphur] and a metal—for example, fool's gold is a coholl of iron. 1610 < Vascon cohol "coholl of athimar [stibnite]" < Arabic كُحْل • kuḥl "eye-black", after the use of this substance as make-up. The term was generalised to all such metal compounds by Zaravcar in the late eighteenth century.

machovine /ˈma.kʊˈvəin/ [strontium] the corporal whose atoms have 38 mora, a yellow-grey metal. 1789 < Scholastic Latin machovīnus "machovine" < Machov, the town in Poland where the corporal was first isolated from the nearby mine's ore. The ash [carbonate] of machovine has seen use as a catalyst for the production of sugar from the braxoch beet.

maschale /məˈskɛːl/ [propionic acid] the acid oil [carboxylic acid] with a spine [carbon chain] of length three, a malodorous clear liquid. 1850 < Scholastic Latin maschāle < Ancient Greek μᾰσχᾰ́λη "armpit", after the substance's presence in human sweat as produced by skin zoia [microorganisms].
