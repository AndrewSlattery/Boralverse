32.5: Monarchs of Borland

summary of the lives of two rulers of Borland in the first millennium.

Victor Rossetus 'the Red-haired' (fl. c6) was the first Prase of the Boral Diocese. He was the first unitary ruler of an independent polity comprising a significant fraction of the island of Borland. He unified the urbanised east of the land while the west and south were settled by Angles to form Angland and Southbar, respectively, and it was under him that so-called 'Roman Borland' first began to succesfully repel the new settlers.

Jothey, King of Borland (fl. 898), known in Borlish as Joðeg /ʒoˈðij/, was the last ruler of the First Kingdom of Borland before it fell to the Danes in 898. The kingdom was conquered when Jothey was only a young man, shortly after his marriage to Brenna of Barrow, cousin of King Roderick of Dunclothe.

However, the life of King Jothey (as recorded in Brethin chronicles) continued as a monarch-in-exile for several more decades. He fled with his wife to Sothbar, where they had several children. They remained at court there for over twenty years, until the skirmishes between Sothbar and Dane Borland finally ended with Sothbar's capitulation and the unification of the island for the first time since being part of the Roman Empire.

Fearful of imprisonment or even execution so as to fully extirpate the former royal line and thus nullify the possibility of future rival claimants, Jothey fled once more with his wife and children to Kent.
