159.5: Cambrick Codices

summaries of two twentieth-century works of writing which were originally written in one or another standard of the Welsh language.

Children of the Battle of Rexam [Wrexham, 1] is a sensation trevold [hit novel] written by Jon Paldreth and published in 1931. It is a fictionalised account of the orphaned children of the Duke of Chester in the decades following his death at the 1483 Battle of Rexam. By Paldreth's account, the children met practically every famous personage in contemporary western Europe, from General daus Sanz to King Andrew of Markland (in fairness, the eldest child was indeed briefly a hostage of the then-prince Andrew). Moreover, Paldreth contrives to have the children present at almost every significant historical event of the time; unlikely as this all is, the book has enjoyed much use in school history lessons as an approachable introduction to the politics of the time.

The Grimmer Hall [2] is a scholastic reference quire about developments in early methodics [programming]. It was published in 1999 and written by New Leudong methodist Cai Sonquo during his tenure at the University of Mehannin [Brisbane]. The work covers the use of algorithms from antiquity (for example Euclid's method for finding coarsest division), through the early modern period (e.g. the waveform display [Fourier transform] and its application to astronomy), and into the titular "grimmer halls" (rooms of many people—usually women—performing calculations longhand) of the early twentieth century. The work ends its account just before the invention of the entirely mechanical general-purpose grimmer [computer].
