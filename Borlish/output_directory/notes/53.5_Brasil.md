53.5: Brasil

Brasil is an island in the North Atlantic off the eastern coast of Mendeva. In the Novomund it was both the first location to be temporarily settled by people from the Vetomund and also the inception of sustained contact following the Landfall of 1471.

Unlike the name Mendeva, it is not known when the name Brasil was first used for this land. What is understood is that it was inspired by the Irish myth of Oil Breasail, a landmass west of Ireland that was said to be shrouded in mist except for one day every seven years. Islands labelled Brasil or similar wordforms appear sporadically on late-medieval maps of the Atlantic coast, usually much smaller and further east than the real place.

The Princess Alexandra of Vascony (sister of Ambrose the Ascendant) was the first Vetomundine royal to set foot in the Novomund, landing in Brasil in 1477.

By the mid-20th century Brasil had been fully incorporated as a region of Ambrosia, retaining only a few vestiges of local political independence. In 1950 the Brasil town of Paratzon formed one end of a new Atlantic link between Ambrosia and Morrack.
