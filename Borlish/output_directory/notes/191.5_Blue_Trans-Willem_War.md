191.5: Blue Trans-Willem War

The Blue Trans-Willem War (Willem: Blaw Trans-Willemsk Órlog, Borlish: Var Tras-Willem Blau) was one of a series of wars in the early modern period which principally involved French and Dutch [German] polities (that is, those powers located on either side of the territory of Willemy [~Benelux, Lorraine]) and which were de facto waged over control of said territory.

Though the sporadic flare-ups of hostilies are difficult to divide into discrete wars without some arbitrariness, modern historiography usually works with the chromatic periodisation of nineteenth-century writer Andrysk de Santer. Her system, based either (depending on the account) on the colours of the victors' standards or on alchemical symbolism, has the Blue war as the penultimate conflict, ending in the late seventeenth century. Some historians, though not de Santer, have classified the Blue war as part of the broader collection of Romantic Wars of the mid-seventeenth century.

As a coup de grâce following a series of smaller humiliations in earlier decades, the kingdom of Burgundy was formally dissolved after the Blue Trans-Willem War, with its territory partitioned between Provence and the kingdoms of France and Bavarn. For example, the duchy of Far Suebia was created as a vassal of Bavarn as a gift from King Frederick to the margrave Thorsten Villingen; the former Burgund capital of Geneva became a subordinate city in this new realm.

The duchy of Avosche and its seat at Axton [Aachen], which after a stable sixteenth century as a French vassal had changed hands five times in recent decades, was returned to French control as part of French Guillenne in the aftermath of the Blue Trans-Willem War.
