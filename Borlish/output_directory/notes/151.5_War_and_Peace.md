151.5: War and Peace

Mystra (in full the Principality of Mystra; Greek: Δεσποτᾶτον τοῦ Μυστρᾶ) was a mordether [crusader] state founded in the eleventh century in the Peloponnese. The holy order of soldiers known as the Convoy Australier was instrumental in conquering the peninsula as a staging post for further attempts at conquest in the Masreck [Levant]. It was named for its then-capital, the city of Mystras. Originally independent, the polity was after some decades reincorporated into the resurgent Roman Empire, and the capital eventually moved to Mysarnos [Pylos]. Mystra was formally dissolved in the mid-seventeenth century as a result of the Romantic Wars.

New Leudong (Welsh: Leudong Newð /ˌlyːˈdɔŋ ˈnawð/) is a polity covering the southeast portion of Chrysia [Australia]. Named for the Cathayan state of Leudong, it has experienced significant Cathayan nation-building alongside British settlement since the late seventeenth century. In the early eighteenth century the trade network of Gurjat [Gujarat] extended as far as New Leudong. Born in New Leudong, mixed-heritage writer Pether Hetsong penned semi-autobiographical work The Land of Golden Lies and Sugared Fire in 1864, often considered the first Chrysian work of literature to enjoy Vetomundine [Eurasian] success. New Leudong was an early adopter of the new social mores of the Household Renovation in the late nineteenth century. A collaboration involving the Branwen Sanatory in New Leudong's capital invented the chemical painkiller cozebdo-diamaschal benjamine [ibuprofen]. In the late twentieth century the New Leudong city of Mehannin [Brisbane] became a technological hub, spurring developments in grimmer [computer] design and methodics [programming].
