59.5: 19th-century Espionage and the Invention of Software

    collected notes on two entirely unrelated works of literature.

Men of Jet and Diamond (originally published in Welsh under the title Dynnon o Vuhuð a Diamont) is an 1890 trevold written by Hasinick Welshman Cadogan Torrior, shortly after he graduated from the University of Nadacow [capital of Hasiny, located not far from the coast on the banks of the *Mississippi] as a scholar of diplomacy.

Published by Blackburn Editions, the work is a rather late member of the first wave of masquira romance. The book was modestly popular in eastern Mendeva [North America], but became much more widely known after being adapted by a New Provence guild into the wildly-succesful 1951 film 'Jet White' (New Provincial Blanc Sabaje).

The Parable of the Mute Bookbinder (originally published in Burgund as Fable dew Reillour Mut) is a philosophical treatise written in 1743 by noblewoman Rachel Desselut in response to Vallakis on the problem of the bounded self-duplication of living things (in brief: how can a finite being contain within itself the ability to create a full copy of itself?).

Desselut's work lays out the separation of Form and of Method, and how they allow for the unsculpted duplication of a bounded being. She argues that in order for living matter to duplicate, the Form must contain within itself an explicit Method describing in some readable language its construction. Thus she inferred the existence of a vital language (in her own writing she called it the Divine Word; we now know it as heredian acid [DNA]) present in the cases of the body.
