Catrin of Kernow (d. 1233) was an influential figure in Tetrarchic Borland.

Family
Catrin of Kernow was the elder sister of King Alan VI of Greater Devon, who orchestrated the Realignment of Devon in 1225. Their uncle was Damian the Wise, the first (Roman) Pope to be elected from among the Brethin religious order.

Legacy
In 1292 the chronicle 'Y Við a Catrin de Cornou' (The Life of Catrin of Kernow) was written, detailing her early life, marriage into Borlish noblility and eventual assassination in 1233. The chronicle is particularly important for being the first longform work written in Borlish (as opposed to Latin) about a lay-person.
