1.5: Children's Curriculum

excerpted from the supplementary notes from the 1981 Report towards a Normal Teaching for Children at Mantelschool, published (originally in Borlish as Contris vars Aðelenç Normal por Ivan a Schol Lajarn) by the contemporary Borland anthracite administration's Ministry for Schools, and intended to serve to standardise the education of children up to the age of twelve. This section is taken from the recommendations with respect to insular history.

…have at least a mozate [high-level] understanding of the development from prehistory until the time of the Second Tetrarchy, although individual schools are encouraged to include more recent material as it relates to vicine [local] matters. This may include the traditions of the local village or quarter, or else notable events (battles, discoveries, etc) which occurred nearby.

Taken in order, pupils should have the opportunity to learn about:
- waves of migration into Borland up to and including the Albic Kelts 
- - early farming and the stoneware found in the Revel mounds (compared to the better-preserved Orkney site at Scarreth [Skara Brae])
- - travel, transport and technology, including the trade necessary for bronze, the later introduction of iron, and the construction of the Çadrosc labyrinth
- - the intertribal system of hill forts in the pre-Classical period and the culture around authority, with reference to extant art, sculpture and jewellery

- classical/imperial Borland and the Romanisation of the island
- - the growth of diplomatic and trade links with Albion and Rome, between Julius Caesar's expeditions to Albion in 55 aN and the beginning of the invasion of the Northern Isles in 42 N
- - remaining Kelt kingdoms and their resistance to Roman rule through the rest of the first century (including a comparison between Buthick of the Iceni and her later imitators on Borland)
- - the ambitions of Emperor Hadrian on the Isles and the establishment of a separate Borlish province (which after the Diocletian reforms became the Boral diocese)
- - Roman culture and language as it spread across the island, including the surviving architecture (e.g. the baths in Axbane), and the urbanisation of the south and east coasts
- - the arrival of Roman Christianity on Borland and the destruction or repurposing of pagan sites, both Kelt and pantheic
- - migration of Romans from Germania Inferior, Belgica and Brittania during the decline of Roman control…
