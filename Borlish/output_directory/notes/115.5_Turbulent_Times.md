115.5: Turbulent Times

collected notes on various events and periods which took place at the time of the Long Peace (ca. 1770–1815).

The Decadence of Belgrade refers to the Kingdom of the Danaw [Danube] in its final decades before the Second German War (1815–23) and the subsequent dissolution of the state. The Decadence also represents the territorial maximum of the kingdom, having wrested Bulgary [Bulgaria] from the suzerainty of the Second Roman Empire [~the Byzantines] after the latter's final collapse in the seventeenth century, and more recently having consolidated control over lands at the northwestern border with Bavarn [Bavaria].

The Mendevan Unmooring (Borlish Deshormejanç Mendevan /deˌzɔr.meˈʒants ˌmɛn.deˈvan/) is the collective name for the various wars and diplomatic developments at the turn of the nineteenth century which led to the weakening and sometimes severing of formal ties of polities in Mendeva [North America] from those in the Vetomund [Old World]. The more explosive conflicts such as the War for Ambrosia [~east and north of the Great Lakes] and the Hasinick Revolution [~lower part of the Mississipi watershed] (against Vascony and Britain, respectively) often overshadow quieter events like the Departure of Mashick [~Mexico].

The Romantic Revival (Borlish Resorgenç Romannesc /reˈzɔr.gɛnts ˌro.maˈnɛx/) was an artistic and political movement which arose towards the end of the eighteenth century. It was characterised by optimistic portrayals of heroism, and especially a belief in a 'brighter past' in the seventeenth century that could be recaptured. It is due to this movement's depiction that a loose congeries of wars in the mid-seventeenth century have become known as the Romantic Wars.
