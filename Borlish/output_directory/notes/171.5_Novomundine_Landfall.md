171.5: Novomundine Landfall

The Novomundine Landfall (Borlish Abanc Novomondin) occurred in 1471 N, when a ship that was part of a New Navarre Enterprise fishing expedition in the North Atlantic sighted and made landfall on the island of Brasil [Newfoundland]. It marks the start of prolonged contact between the Vetomund [Afroeurasia] and the Novomund [Americas] (notwithstanding evidence of sporadic Norrish [Norse] contact with the region), and the first century following the Landfall is known to historians as the Intertwining Century.

The terms Novomund and Mendeva [North America] date to this voyage; a surviving map from the Landfall voyage itself is marked terrae mendevalensis, after the Vask [Basque] mendeval "west".

The Landfall occurred at the height of the so-called Vascon Ascendancy, when Vascony [N Spain, SW France] reached its territorial maximum under Ambrose III, and the trade opportunities that arose over the following decades were just as beneficial for the polity. Ambrose's rival, Munir al-Hamdawi of Morrack [Morocco], quickly redirected the efforts of his presciently-named New World Company westward (having previously maintained trade routes to the East), leading to the discovery of the faster southern route to the Novomund and the islands of the Arcabil [Caribbean].

The first Vetomundine royal to set foot in the Novomund was King Ambrose's elder sister Princess Alexandra of Vascony, who visited the new settlement of Paratzon [St John's, NL] in the 1490s. It is unknown why she (and several female attendants) undertook the voyage, although her second husband's various deficiencies and scandals have been implicated. Her visit is remembered for advancing understanding of scurvy (the chemical sandrine [vitamin C] is named in her honour), although it would take over a century and experiments with guy-conies [guinea pigs] before ships could come close to effectively preventing the malady.
