Brenna of Barrow (fl. 898) was the cousin of King Roderick of Dunclothe. She married the young King Jothey of Borland shortly before the First Kingdom of Borland fell to the Danes in 898. Subsequently she fled with her husband to Sothbar, where she bore several children.

Two decades later Sothbar surrendered to Dane Borland and the family were forced to flee once more, this time to Kent. Much of our knowledge of the remainder of her life is preserved through the Brethin copies of her correspondence with her aging uncle in Dunclothe.
