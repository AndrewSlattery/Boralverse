138.5: Steeplepost Tapestry

The Steeplepost Tapestry (Vascon: Lo Tapìs Campanaral) was a screen of several myriad black or white tiles built in Ambrosia's capital city of Aiga d'Angoixa [~Quebec City]. Completed in 1820 and erected to overlook one of the city's central squares, it was inspired by the (fairly new) 'latticework' art movement.

One ambitious goal for the Tapestry was to be able to portray journalist's sketches of events from across the country with great speed, using the flag-lamp steeplemesh infrastructure that had been built up over the last few decades. Although this was achieved several times, the practical limitations of transmitting so much information by steeplepost prevented it from becoming routine. Instead, the majority of the tapestry's time was spent displaying short pieces of news or government messages in text and simple symbols.

The use of the word 'diced' to mean 'blocky, pixellated' dates back to a calque of Provincial icon dau 'die image'. This phrasing was coined in 1821 in disparaging reference to the Tapestry.

Just a few years into its operation, a series of hoax messages which spread rapidly via the Ambrosian steeplemesh made their way onto the Tapestry. These so-called 'Lies of 1824' included a report of the governor's death and culminated after several days with an alleged declaration of war from New Provence.

In 2020, a replica of the Tapestry was unveiled in Markland to mark the bicentenary of the original's completion.
