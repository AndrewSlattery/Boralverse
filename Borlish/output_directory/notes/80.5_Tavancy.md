80.5: Tavancy

Tavancy (Merch /təˈvan.səi/, Run'allo [Quechua] Tawanden /taˈwan.dɛn/), formerly the Tavancine Empire, is a political in western Cappatia [South America] occupying the coast between the Isthmus [of Panama] to the north and Maboutian [~Chilean] lands to the south.
Toponymy

The name Tavancy (Latin Tavantia) is a back-formation from the adjective Tavancine (Latin tavantīnus). This comes from the earliest Latin name imperium tavantīnum first attested in the sixteenth century, which was borrowed via Morrove [Morrocan] Arabic as a somewhat-mistaken partial calque from the Run'allo tawantin-suyu "the quartet of provinces".
History

The first Vetomundine people to document the Tavancine Empire were Morrack [Morroco] traders with the New World Company (شركة العالم الجديد), who had already begun dealing with Arcabil [Caribbean] peoples and with Mashick [the Aztec Empire]. Through the sixteenth century several wayports along the west Cappatian coastline were established by said traders, some of which would grow into substantial staddomain [~export colony] settlements.

The death of Tavancine Emperor Cariwasari in 1660 is suspected to have been an assassination carried out on Morrack orders, purportedly to allow for more profitable trade in silver—Morrack was at the time running low on funds to support their ongoing wars in Vascony and Libya.

In the early 1930s, a collaboration between alchemists at the Branwen Sanatory in New Leudong and the University of Rimack in Tavancy led to the discovery of cozebdo-diamaschal benjamine [ibuprofen] (in pill form familiarly called "CD" or, in Markland, "Tommy pills") as an effective hebetant [painkiller] without significant adversions [side effects].
