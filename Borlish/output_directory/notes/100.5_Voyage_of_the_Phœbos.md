100.5: Voyage of the Phœbos

The Phœbos was a flagship of the Kingdom of Britain in the early sixteenth century. Having profited greatly at the expense of the other polities of Albion [Great Britain] during the Wars of Fealty, Britain under King Howel sought to extend its trade mesh past its posts down the west African coast, and trade with Asia directly by sea.

To this end, a coterie of ships led by the Phœbos (and itself captained by Martan mac Kellot) was tasked with sailing as far east as possible. After rounding Africa and making port in such places as Ungotia [Zanzibar], they were directed by Umanick [Omani] and then Chinese traders. Via Gurjat and Madray [1], they eventually arrived in Borune, at that time the southeasternmost land known in the Vetomund.

The Phœbos was thus present at the Great Borunesk Meeting of 1517. The ship's meeting with the Morrack ship the Cynthia in the port city of Sinquan is the definitive moment in the course of the Meeting, and it appears in several book and film adaptations. It is popularly assumed that the crews could not understand one another; in fact at least a dozen crewmembers of the Phœbos spoke some Arabic, as the British and Morrack trade meshes had overlapped for centuries.

Unlike the Cynthia, the Phœbos would not attempt to circumnavigate the globe; tales of the magnitude of the oceans ahead dissuaded mac Kellot from such a course.
