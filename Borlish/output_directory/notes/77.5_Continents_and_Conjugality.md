77.5: Continents and Conjugality

The Novomund, also called the New World, refers to the lands to the west of the Atlantic Ocean. Inhabited for over a myriad years, the history of these lands comes together with that of the Vetomund following the Novomundine Landfall of 1471.

The Novomund is composed of the two great landmasses of Mendeva and Cappatia [North and South America], along with over a dozen major islands (such as Brasil [Newfoundland] and Cocain [Cuba]) and innumerable lesser ones.

Many crops now cultivated worldwide were first farmed in the Novomund, including shadome fruit, tartover, shockle and mikecorn [tomatoes, potatoes, chocolate and maize]. Products such as coshow [rubber] and kistmaw [tobacco] also derive from plants native to the Novomund.

The Household Renovation of the late nineteenth century was an attitudinal shift towards non-traditional familial structures, the institution of marriage, and the social role of children.

It was prefigured by the deemphasis of religion in government in those countries party to the 1850 Laic Declarations of Belgrade, as well as contraceptive medical innovations of the time like coshow bed-sleeves [latex condoms] and stauron retainers [IUDs].

The popularity of the masquira [~heist/vigilante] literary genre, with its hidden identities and lampooning of upper-class mores, is usually understood to have come hand in hand with the Household Renovation (not to mention the enduring popularity of masquira in tovarick [queer] circles).

Early embracers of the Household Renovation included Britain, the Riverine Cities and New Leudong [a polity in south-eastern Australia]; the ethos would spread (especially via Britain's cultural cachet in Gulf Mendeva) elsewhere over the subsequent decades.
