84.5: Lower Mendeva

Lower Mendeva (Borlish Mendeva Bassem /ˌmɛn.deˈva ˈba.sɛm/) is a geographical region comprising the southern section of the continent of Mendeva, located west of the Mendevan Gulf. The term sometimes also includes the islands of the Arcabil, which are located within said Gulf.

Contact between Lower Mendeva and the Vetomund began in the late fifteenth century with merchant ships from the Morrack New World Company (established by Malik Munir al-Hamdawi in 1463). In turn, traders therefrom encountered the peoples of the Arcabil, the Mashick Empire in Lower Mendeva, and further south the Tavancine Empire in Cappatia.

The region is predominated by the polity of Mashick, which stretches from coast to coast and so far north as to border Mivock in the west and Taisha in the east.

Many barrick innovations of the late Workshop period came out of Lower Mendeva, likely due to practical concerns around the rapid spread of wired post (there being little previous adoption of the flag-lamp steeplemesh in the region to displace).

By the late twentieth century, this region had become major exporters of foods such as mause and amback.

Many trade goods originated in Lower Mendeva, including billrod dye, shockle, shadome and tashban.
