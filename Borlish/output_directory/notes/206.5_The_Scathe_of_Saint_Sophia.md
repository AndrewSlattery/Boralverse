excerpted from 2014 popular history textbook The Fourth Burning of London, and other Screwups: the Eventful History of Things Going Wrong, written in collaboration with the Faculty of Domain History at the University of Huzatre [~Bayonne] by writer (formerly and more famously of historical lovetales) Galarça fi Molhomé, who undertook her studies there.

Nonetheless, the dramatic quality of the Scathe of Saint Sophia, along with the narrative that it led directly to the Empire's final collapse less than a decade later, have led this theory to become…
