"Ac eu nos y cæros," dis Halina. "Un çaucr Promethean ag pie nostr! Tu poð noc rovar ig jo le stim cojan. Incossirabr es nos neleu nossy vecin reconnoscr deut all'ig complið par sy fraðr deur veint annað."
“It’s such a chance,” Halina said. “A Promethean society on our doorstep! You can’t tell me not to be interested. It is absurd we shouldn’t speak to our neighbour because of what his brother did twenty years ago.”

"Par sy—" Vadim tis vars parol. "Sy fraðr devastau tout. Impossibr es tu vel ig pardonnar!"
“What his—” Vadim groped for words. “His brother ruined everything. You can’t possibly forgive that!”

"Sy fraðr sta i," dis Halina cos obstinaç. "Nos posseu y bel amigtað beudar vars Segr Connic—"
“That was his brother,” Halina said obstinately. “We could extend the hand of friendship to Sir Connick—”

"Luy stant amig a cour dy Segnour Diabolesc e ci Promethean eð orgy recevent!"
“Who is bosom friends with the Devil’s Lord and Prometheans and has orgies!”

"Ah! Jo save sceyen orgy."
“Ha! I knew it was orgies.” 

Vadim fo vuglað ne rackesc. "Jo dey le prohibir. I no's soiç idone por tey."
Vadim choked on his vodka. “Absolutely not. He is not a fit acquaintance for you.”
