141.1: Vampire Film Review

excerpt in translation from Jacint Brunat's review of Zachariah, a horror film about a vampire released in 1950.

Ne spien de poðir y lasc fornir con certan dell'aspect costumneressem de cont a vampier, Kiawaman soupley abiltað thaumesc a Zachariah e depegnt ig nossy heros le vencn par mejan d'un spig boscer ognt (noc, com ny livr e lonc saivenç pouvlancer, par ðurnç).
In an attempt to incorporate some of the more traditional aspects of vampire folklore, Kiawaman grants Zachariah mystic powers and has the heroes defeat him by means of a sanctified wooden stake (not, as in the book and in popular wisdom, by burning).

L'ec novel abiltað, soll'auteç d'un forgour ottem, sceusn un conjogntur mis a plaç entr Zachariah e Vania ne sona de praxitel an art parey—aglon, nos receveu y jout cojan d'un domn jou follant entr y cortisment de dou segr.
These new powers, in the hands of a better writer, could have set up a dynamic between Zachariah and Vania as artists of the same craft—instead, we are given the tired trope of a woman torn between the affections of two men.

Offignt naðusc es ig l'auditoir crein for apen no scey bogr un decijon a prendr; Vania manc attragnt vars y protagonist necun.
It doesn't help that the audience barely believes there is any choice to make; Vania has no chemistry with either lead.
