120.1: Rearguard

excerpt in translation from the historical trevold Rearguard, set during the eleventh-century mordether [crusade] conquests in the Masreck [Levant].
 
Dec orruð i carra noc un respos contr sy convoc a pan rompr accougl, e dec i sera attent reunt ag garnçon toð cas, Omar quauc vars y donjon.
Since it seems his invitation to eat together will not be accepted, and since he is expected back at the garrison anyway, Omar hurries to the tower.

The soldiers have been praying here, at their posts rather than in the mosque with the people, because they cannot be caught too far from the gates when the inevitable alarm goes up that the first Roman vanguards have been spotted.

Lonc y commant dy gournour, band aun toð y poið enverimmað ben coyençað, eç arbr tos, eð y feu tars de tout calscon benoçabr com vitagl e vegr.
By order of the governor, men have poisoned or blocked all the wells, cut down trees, and scourged the land of anything that could be used for provisions and fodder.

Y barbarin son dolent sou y caldour bruslant, ma il son avançant nentamen.
The barbarians are suffering in the scorching heat, but they advance nonetheless.
