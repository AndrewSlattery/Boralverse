81.1: Everything About You

To commemorate the closing night of the musical Groundhog Day this last weekend, something a bit different: translated lyrics of the song Everything About You.

Tu am flaut, ma tu am noc l'abysm
You like boats, but you don't like deep water

E tu a hougr de narr, eð y fin dell'oc mont
And you're afraid of clowns, and the end of the world

E tu am lasc, ma general tu vel il sein a pog belem bressem
And you like films, but as a rule you think they should be ten minutes shorter

Eð ant eld novoç bajau tu un doncel eð oc t'ajoutaçau la noc y plurem
And when you were nineteen you kissed a girl and you didn't particularly like it

E tu brouc y ðeu an pol ig attost prestabr
And you love the thighs of perfectly-roasted chicken

E fin a tu aus doç tu dorme sou lumner, neðan Bon Jesu volois smargr des vogt dy foscur e lor raug te cavir por ty maðr noc aïðar con sy maðr
And you slept with the light on until you were twelve, because you thought Jesus was going to appear from the dark and get angry with you for not helping your mom with her mom

Ben can noc menar te dignant Pieðr, desig—
Or walking the dog who you named Stephen, because—

Or, vis, jamay n'a tu raçon la me dað
Well, actually, you never did tell me why

Oc abseïð, jo sau tout a teir cas tey
Apart from that, I know everything about you

Jo sau tout a teir
I know everything
