jannestar "sweep"

jannestar /ˌʒa.nɛˈstar/ [ˌʝa.nɪˈstɑː]
- sweep, brush, to clean (a surface) using a broom or similar implement;
- (archaic or humorous) involve, embroil, drag in, to cause to be overly involved in;
- brush off, disregard, dismiss, to pay no attention to;
- (colloquially) vacuum, hoover, to suck up dust or similar detritus using a machine to create negative pressure

Etymology: verbal derivation of jannest "broom, cleaning brush", from Old Boral janeste, geneste "broom, broom shrub" (the former originally from northern dialect), from Latin genesta "broom shrub". The noun jannest has been supplanted in its botanical sense by originally-Kelt banag "broom shrub" (see also Norman balay, Cambrick banadyl). In the last sense, attested since 1941.

    excerpt in translation from correspondence between Pentrose mathematician Darren Brodus and his brother-in-law Niklás der Fecht.

Jo's oyent ig l'area ne Veron se recarra ovart a parform ancour—dit es Al Igne, l'ouvr de Bruno, sera y primer la parformað posc y var!
I hear they shall reopen the arena in Verona to performances—they say Bruno's Wings Afire will be the first shown there since the war!

Jo broucau con hugt sy fraðr Jacom connoscr pre jamay sta i reconnuð cos mondiallessem (ne pariscenç il aun y dou un heu equal cos stoniscent, ða meðes stant jammel); nos eyeu a loit accougl a Houlm ne 21.
I had the pleasure of knowing her brother Jacom before she was ever known to the wider world (apparently they are astonishingly similar in appearance, even for twins); we fought together at Hulm in 21.

L'ig gazou a se caut mesgournað cos horfiant eð lon alcun fegnment y var prolongað lonc meis—pu jo no dey l'oc invectif souvr neðan jamay le quïr.
That was a horrifically-mismanaged offensive and in all honestly prolonged the war for months—but I mustn't start this rant, or I will never end.

Jacom n'aye nien fait for sy sour e lourell'aldr lavar, toð cas final (ig degnant un quil quemant desirar eð y convoc de Frioul an asc paçous sevir volois lon fregn sy memoranç influïr), e donc no poð jo nien fair for te rannuðar all'oc melodram.
Jacom had nothing but praise for his sister and their parents, in any case (although the desire for a warm bed and the call of peacetime Furlaine no doubt influenced his recollection), so I cannot do anything but recommend the opera to you.
