As imperial hegemony in Europe and northern Africa began to fall apart, so did the Single Caliphate; an independent admiralty in Libya was declared in 1237 (at roughly the same time as the Morrove admiralty to the west).

Although Libya's navy was not yet trading directly with the Novomund in the sixteenth century, seamen from the region were commonly employed in the merchant fleets of Morrack and (especially) of Provence.
