82.1: Dane-ruled York

excerpt in translation from 1997 academic textbook Del Christianizamento dell'Isole Norroveste (On the Christianisation of the Northwestern Isles), written by historian of Middle-Age religion Dijaca Rofotto.

Naðusc sta l'oc un issent incoïbr de commouð lonc y tarm cambresc;
In part this [York falling and Lincoln standing] was the inevitable result of tensions along the Welsh border;

durant meðes l'epoc paçous stendiscent a comparaçon, Theodoric l'Auvast eð Owain de Brochwel y dou aurn jug centuir corrovað magn surfaint por y Lign Severn defendr.
even during the relatively-long period of peacetime both Theodric the Awefast and Owain of Brochwel maintained ever-more levy forces to police the long Severn Line.

Contrig, Yorvic eu sauf a se condonar sou regn dannesc.
By contrast, Yorwick almost gave itself over to Dane rule.

Degnant ig regest suajoir sein ben scarder ben tendençous cos clar (scaunç brethin meðes dell'oc epoc no's enter confiabr),
Though convincing records are either fragmentary or clearly biased (even Brethin writing in this period cannot be entirely trusted),

creut cos general es ig y cort dy scavin l'ablegau preluïscent com çamoc,
it is generally believed that the alderman's court threw him out pre-emptively as a sop,

ne spien de vanc aur aðief oblatar volonter ag gazovour por poðir un devastation total dy citað evitar.
hoping to offer enough treasure freely to the invaders that they could avoid a total destruction of the city.
