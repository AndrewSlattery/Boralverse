excerpt in translation from reference quire On the Dane Supremacy in Kernow [Brittany] and the Creation of Normandy, written by deixist historian Professor Jockin Abiscander.

Y premendessem sta l'aðoinç de commovenç viking lonc y rimmot.
Most pressing was the inexorable rise in Viking activity along the coast. 

Gazou ag banc dy Sein e l'Orn ern inceut ci meis paravant, ma dagormay il spanoirn ag vest; y monastir a Landvennick meðes se cof incendiað a cainç l'an 888 N. 
Raids along the Seine and the Orne had begun in earnest some decades prior, but now spread west; even the monastery at Landvennick was burned to the ground in 888 N. 

Necun no'rn y commovenç dy dannesc vecinað com piglment; ag dou cost dy Canal caf batman benoçaurn l'instabiltað politic (oc a digr y sfondranç Wessaxon ag norð eð y ci querel lombard ag souð) por eðegl concarr e fragossau instançar.
Nor were the Danes' activities confined to looting; on both sides of the Channel war leaders took advantage of political instability (the collapse of Wessex in the north and the Lombard disputes in the south) to conquer territory and settle. 

Scey evidenç ig gent dannesc reseyen doutr meðes y flou Vir, oc stant part lonc y tarm fransc e domnon com l'er traitað nell'Accord Catumagin dy siecr ogt,
There is evidence of such Danish settlement even past the Vire river, part of the Franco-Dumnonian border as agreed in the eighth-century Catumagin Accords, 

e portan posc y Fransc concedoirn solemn l'oc feu ny siecr deg e cossy corporalisaurn Normandy, y Vir remaneu y tarm.
although when this fiefdom was officially ceded by the Franks in the tenth century to form Normandy, the Vire remained the border.
