76.1: Origins of Manoscard

excerpt in translation from 1976 music history quire Shallmews and Fithels: the influence of post-Tetrarchic Hymnal Practice on Popular Music.

Nentamen, y character dell'eç caum vienn dy poið a nou fanglanç preluïscendessem yon no se poð for apponment addoit a them.
Nonetheless, the character of these pieces draws upon yet earlier innovations about which we can only make educated guesses.

Cal teissir, com bustr, des y benoç communal dy kyriel manoscart ne bempart all'eç ouvr?
What to make, for example, of the shared use of the manoscard scale in many of these works?

Lonc ustol figurau nos ig y manoscart fos un orðenjanç borgonnesc dy siecr doç nuverrem,
Traditionally we conceive of the manoscard as a Burgund innovation of the late twelfth century,

origin ayent parmy ci hymn parformað ny communtað religious ag region Luberon auster.
beginning with hymns performed in the religious communities of the eastern Luberon region.

All'hour yon cos final scey evidenç a melody manoscart ny music romannesc temporane,
By the time we do have evidence of manoscard melody in contemporary popular music,

nos veim benoç dy kyriel tras Europ ovester des Mondovel a norð e lonc y camin vars Baglem a souð, e donc defagl es sell'orin vray discernir.
we see use of the scale across western Europe as far north as Mondwell and as far south as Bagliemmo, so it is difficult to determine its true homeland.
