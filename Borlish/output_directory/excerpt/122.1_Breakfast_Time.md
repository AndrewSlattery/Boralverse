122.1: Breakfast Time

excerpt in translation from the beginning of the short story Breakfast Time by Derin Edala.

Mell'heir es cogntið de liesc recorrent veg ancour.
My son’s stuck in a time loop again.

I crey jo saif noc, lon digr.
He thinks I don’t know, of course.

I n'a jamay me descont ig ly cay l'oc (ben ig i poð l'oc fair, parcanç; jo no's scur de calun).
He’s never told me that this happens to him (or that he can do this, possibly; I’m not sure which it is).

Plausibr es ig jo's un mal maðr, ða jo n'ay me provað a l'ig confeyanç dignar.
Maybe I’m a bad mother, if I haven’t proven myself worthy of that trust.

Ma no scein for tan veg yon se poð y heir sgardar sy jorn passant a monnocquant ant impatienç infruniscent, reagent de tout teyon dis cos rapid demay just com picq eð alcun goppiet mostrant ag cainç y goppietandessem meðes, e soulor descenent souscen desmecchiattað ma rajounað eð ant un exuberanç novel a cost un incainç vars emboscment souvar dy cos y previsiblessem meðes, fin a tu discern y ratiocinaçon evident.
But there are only so many times that you can watch your son trudge through a day with bored impatience, anticipating everything you say just a little too quickly and showing no surprise to even the most surprising event, and then come downstairs the next day disoriented but rejuvenated and with a new zest for life and a tendency to get blindsided by even the most predictable things, before you make the obvious connection.
