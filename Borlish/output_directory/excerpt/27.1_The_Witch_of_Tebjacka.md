extract in translation from Mashick Arabic of 1823 short shory 'The Witch of Tebjacka', written by Tazim Gennun.

Cayen ciel de neir fosc encoster, aguilað par murðon stel lougent.
The sky was a deep, inky black, studded with a myriad glittering stars. 

Y lun oppos bagna l'œcumen sou un lumner argentastr, ombr jaint lonc tras y ci tombr dallottað.
The full moon bathed the landscape in a silvery light, casting long shadows across the rolling hills. 

L'arbr hurislan sou un bris fresc, un frigçon dant ag font dy tors a Samir.
A cool breeze ruffled the trees, sending a shiver down Samir's spine. 

I se fassau y mantel atorn a sarraðessem e porseveu a un camin trovar tras y makisaç.
He wrapped his cloak tighter around himself and continued to pick his way through the undergrowth.

Soutan oyeu Samir coroc d'un bachet ados.
Suddenly, Samir heard a twig snap behind him.

I volteu raut e lor attenoy par un pog d'hour, ci oregl sforçant, ma tout taçoirn. L'ençau tornant a sy camin reprendr, ma uncos le quinau starc par ados, le dessoclant vars tar yembr.
He spun round and waited for a few moments, straining his ears, but all was silent. He turned to continue on his way, but something crashed into him from behind, knocking him to the ground.
