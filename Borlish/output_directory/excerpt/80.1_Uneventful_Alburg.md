80.1: Uneventful Alburg

excerpt in translation from the collected correspondence of Absolon Mortenszen, playwright and commentator in Alburg, Denmark.

J'ay spien vos seyað fort parsanað des y mephit dont scavoist vos ne vossy pistol derran;
I hope you are well recovered from the ague of which you spoke in your last missive;

Me stou bogr vos soumonir a cossirar y citað salir fin a fis sera y prepondranç a commarç.
I need not remind you to consider leaving the city until the bulk of the trading has ended.

Inconnuð tojorn es cal contamen foran posn marcant galar, com sceus my granpaðr tesmognar.
One never knows what foreign ills merchants may bring, as my grandfather could have attested.

Y bourg reman cojan equal des vossy sgaranç com sceye pre nossy acconnosc, vos plaç d'oïr.
The town remains as dull since you departed as it was before we met, you will be pleased to hear.

Ja galað, y casatabr dijarbr sull'ig rif meðes surcay issugtessem posc toð gent de nis nell'oc bourg ablegar;
In point of fact, even the decent lodging-house on the strand is poorer for having banned all the interesting people in town;

parcanç ig il me parmet jug d'entrar es mal me desconent, malgrað jo vil toð mod me sarvir dy ci sigt la tandic possibr.
perhaps it speaks poorly of me that they yet allow me entrance, though I will at least avail myself of the views while I can.
