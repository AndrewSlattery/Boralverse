26.1: The Early Tachygraph

excerpt in translation from Vitoria Queiros' 1998 quaterno Thirteen Inventions which Changed the World, published by Pontudra Editions.

Par surcresc, l'accaç campaner baric sta nuverrem aðief a noc ancour l'ançan doujug a gonfan e lamp destarrir, magn afferjarant tras Spagn, Gal eð Italy.
Moreover, the barrick steeplepost was still so young that it had not displaced the earlier flag-lamp system, widespread across Spain, Gaul and Italy.

With some exceptions (notably the Cracow-Bitom line in southern Poland), the ground was clear for the spread of wired post across northern and eastern Europe, and indeed it is from these places that we get most of the barrick innovations of the late Workshop period.

So the early wired tachygraphs were cumbersome to use and expensive to get hold of—and furthermore there was little incentive for businesses, who could simply hire a tapper already fluent in the Adamich system.
