132.1: Cinderella Retelling

excerpt in translation from the beginning of a short story by Kitty Unpretty.

Marcus lejau cos soutan a plaç meg dy lag. Un domn oc un curtel azur portant sta ja asseyent sur y Banc de Cris.
Marcus stopped abruptly in the middle of the grass. A woman in a blue dress was already sitting on the Crisis Bench.

I reconnosce noc y curtel. Y domn lançau sy gas atras cant l'er asseyent.
He didn’t recognize the dress. She looked up from where she was sitting.

"Pardon," dis y prinç n'y man leyant. "Jo prefaye noc ig alcun hom no fos ac apart." I creye noc un acconnosc por alcun hom nell'oç curtel memorar. Caye un gendr memorabr de curtel.
“Sorry,” he said, holding up his hands. “I didn’t think anyone would be over here.” He didn’t think he remembered an introduction to anyone in that dress. It was a memorable sort of a dress.

"Jo crey vossy maðr encontrar entarn?" osau i digr, dec l'encontrau ec maðr ne ðougl.
“I believe I ran into your mother inside?” he ventured, because he ran into so many mothers.

"L'ig no's assistent," dis i, oc no stant bogr l'ig seyon desirant oïr e no stant cos absoluð nien seyon hellinabr n'oc moment.
“She’s not here,” she said, which was not what he wanted to hear and which he absolutely could not handle at the moment.
