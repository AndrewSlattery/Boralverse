55.1: Marian Siegert

excerpt in translation from the collected correspondence of Marian Siegert ~ Miller (1725–56).

Albert me suggereu por te scaur primer, e lon nien for hugt ay jo l'oc fait; ne bon mont voun ty bel nau caressem m'amusar n'encost com ne voç, ma toð cas final jo no poð kiglar pieç appariscenç sentir de vous.
Albert suggested that I write to you first, and I was only too happy to do so; ideally your witticisms shall be as entertaining on paper as in person, and in any case I cannot help but feel some kinship with you. 

Nos som y ci dou tog pluottant jait deur y niaç a Paðr por deïr gilaçar soul.
We are the two fledgling sparrows cast out from Father's nest to fend for ourselves.

Jo so certan y vertað suraðoint; lon fregn pos y Rey un sunt calscon de puvon fornir con vitagl
I am of course exaggerating; doubtless the King can provide for any number of wards 

(ða cos indignant alcot sceint acceptað; ty ci crevoscr con Paðr no stan parcanç tan retenuð com tu speraus!
(no matter how grudgingly accepted; your evenings with Father were perhaps not as private as you hoped! 

Veleu nos sengr digr casc gent dessou connoscn l'ig Insoutiltað dy Prinç M ou?), ma ða meðes jo no poð larc jamir.
Shall we just say that everyone downstairs is aware of Prince M's Indiscretion?), but neither can I complain overmuch.
