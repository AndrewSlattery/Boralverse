53.1: Shady Dealings

translated excerpt from a 1813 letter from Dorothe Shock in Miszen [Meissen] to her mother Johanne.

I n'a y við commercer adoptað con tan farvour com tu aye le vuscað (ben toð cas con un farvour men all'ig yon l'a casc noit jolleyant con amig soldartaç eð aubon a test boscer adoptað!)
He has not taken to commerce as enthusiastically as you had hoped (or at least not as well as he has taken to nights out with soldierly friends and woodheaded mornings!) 

ma sy tegnt visacer fouceur cos rumorað pariscn aïr impet dað an congeries a vençon fort san con y ci forniscour usual.
but his allegedly-charming features seem to have contributed to a string of advantageous deals with the usual suppliers.

Tu nil ða j'ay bon scoc recevir n'oyent ig l'eç ensignment boscer poscvaran son neyant a se cavir acatað teint mitað dy taus meðes innajað la (no dign y dominanç de Hambourg sur troc lonc Elf);
You shall I expect be unsurprised to hear that the Potchware woodcarvings refuse to be bought at even half the cost of importing them (never mind Hamburg's stanglehold on the Elbe);

toð cas final j'acavau un conement de Crovatia stant enfoldesc particuler ig l'eç fosn y soul ouvr d'art connuð d'un pouvlanç remot ne Chrysia, oc ayent nossy despart limitað an quantað supportabr.
eventually I managed to convince a particuarly-credulous customer from Crovatia that they were the only attested artworks of a remote people of Chrysia, which limited our losses to an acceptable amount.
