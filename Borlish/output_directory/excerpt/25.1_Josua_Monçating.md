The sixth Baron Monçating was born to Lord Josua and Lady Evangelin in the winter of 1770 at their estate in Launembrig. 

Segr Josua, cos incoïbr, sta luy meðes un parsonaç querellabr ny melle damvaðesc deut a raçon plusour:
Lord Josua, inevitably, was himself a controversial figure in Damvath society for several reasons: 

stant un ivan des y staddomain cappatian,
having been born in the Cappatian staddomain, 

stant marið con un nobr ant caðen ancestral waranesc (recent magn demay por pudour vetomondin suffigr),
having married a noblewoman of Warnine descent (far too recently for Vetomundine sensibilities), 

e final stant y barony de Haubrath tramis par sy cosvour scon stemn posc finisceu un calver legal un dezein vant (parmy provost y longessem disputað a histoir borallesc).
and finally having inherited the Barony of Haubrath from his second cousin following a decade-long legal battle (one of the longest legal disputes in Borland history). 

Luy decident apres y grad sindr broyar e cossy for Monçating retenir sta y coup occeint poll'idea dy mendrem aïr a convenibiltað.
His decision thereupon to dissolve the senior title and retain only Monçating was the final nail in the coffin for any hope of respectability.
