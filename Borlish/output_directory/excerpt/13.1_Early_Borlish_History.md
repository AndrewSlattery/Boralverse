13.1: Early Borlish History

excerpt from The Story of Borland (Y Stoir d'Istr Boral), a school history textbook published in 1982 by Cordin Editions.

Sceyen a coul fix chrestan venent ag Dioces Boral (eð aval y Preu Reyaum d'Istr Boral) dy ci annað tardessem ny siecr cinq e vars y siecr set cos fort.
There was a steady influx of Christians into the Diocese of Boral (and later the First Kingdom of Borland) from the latter years of the fifth century, well into the seventh.

Early on, many of these were Roman or even Celtic Christians displaced by the Germanic migrations, and by the time of Pope Mercury II in 590N, Rome had taken a particular strategic influence in the small kingdom, which at the time was on the defensive against a stronger Sothbar.

In the first instance, the new Kingdom was viewed as a vital Christian outpost from which Rome could send missionaries east and west to aid in the conversion of Albion and the Danes.
