46.1: Wearing a Mask or a Suit (cont.)

continued excerpt from Portingale author Ezio Carvallo's 1860 trevold Tejan de Masquira ou Jalico, pioneer of the masquira genre of stories.

Y porrujon cercondaurn y preu taug enter ny palaç, e donc au Matthias prudenç fait por y cogn reconnoscr ant asmuth vars y rugment dallottað.
The balcony ran around the entire first storey of the palace, and Matthias had been careful to note which corner faced the rugged uplands.

L'aer sta fresc e clar, eð y porrujon sta pres vogt d'alcun hom.
The air was fresh and clear, and the balcony was almost deserted.

Caye freit demay por y plurem dell'host cas Escriva vinn sou y ciel ovart eð admirn la y sigt, eð y ci autr hom pog sur y porrujon stan haft demay ne collocq por y corp angost ne rob fosc parcevir dimeyant lonc y mur.
It was too cold for most of the Escrivas' guests to stand out in the open air and admire the view, and the few other people on the balcony were too busy chatting to notice the slight body in dark robes edging along the wall.

Lonc exact l'aðendr sceye un lumner blau e febr, ignau aðief a visibr apen, appariscent ny ciel norðer just dessur dy loffocq.
Precisely on schedule a faint blue light, so soft that it was barely visible, appeared in the sky to the north just above the horizon.
