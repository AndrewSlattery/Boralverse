notes in translation on the subject of the Redstone Chair.

Y Caðer ne Pieðr Roug sta costroit ny siecr deg jagerrem atorn d'un los ne greut; y nom dy carpenter es repars ne vogt dell'hour.
The Redstone Chair was fashioned in the late tenth century around a block of sandstone; the name of the carpenter is forgotten.

This block was (allegedly) the block upon which the Elved Marriage between a princess of Markland and the ruler of Dane Northumber was solemnised, ending hostilities between the two polities for almost a century.

Bempart monarch n'Albion sousevent, e cos particuler de Marclont e de Norðhumbr, ern coronnað sur y Caðer ne Pieðr Roug.
Many subsequent monarchs of Albion, and especially of Markland and Northumber, were crowned on the Redstone Chair.

During the Second Tetrarchy of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, most of the Drengot Emperors sat upon the Chair, and as such it was relocated to London.
