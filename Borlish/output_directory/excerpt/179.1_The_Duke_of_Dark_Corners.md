179.1: The Duke of Dark Corners

excerpt in translation from The Duke of Dark Corners (originally published in Welsh as Dug y Gilfah Dowł, meaning the same thing), an 1884 work of historical parachthony [speculative fiction] by author Taguen ah Owain. Her alternate version of the Medieval Imperia (a period of European and circum-Mediterranean centralisation in the eleventh and twefth centuries) features an entirely fictitious set of empires ruled not from Paris, Bardwick, Stamboul and Cairo [1], as in reality, but instead from Damvath [capital of Borland], Florence, Tanger and Kiew.

Y nievr mattin se penen sur y pil n'ollem dy havan cant Fraðr Aldric folla un camin tras y rout bassem ny citað caver.
The morning mist clung to the harbor's elmwood quays as Brother Aldric made his way through the lower streets of the capital.

Le dessur, y gran tour cas y cancelry imperial faye gavlot ny ciel gris com un aguil ne pieðr, sy gonfan drappeyan sou y vent saleyað souvolant ne haut des ec aug Rustighan.
Above him, the great tower of the imperial chancery pierced the grey sky like a stone needle, its banners snapping in the salt wind that swept up from the Rustigh waters.

A cost dell'oç edifiç imposant, yon autr annað y pentis de pescour ayen y rif parsemnað, sceyen aglon sdroy plen de seð Toscan e d'arom Morrou, ant ossatur d'egnam fosc des ançantað e roçon a mar.
Beside that imposing edifice, where once fishermen's huts had dotted the shoreline, now stood warehouses filled with Tuscan silk and Morrove spices, their timber frames dark with age and sea-spray.

Un marcant ne vestið Flamesc er travodant a haut voç contr un maistr de quarf sur y pisantour de sy carc.
A merchant in Flemish cloth was loudly haggling with a dock-keeper over the weight of his cargo.

Aldric tirau sy rob broun a sarraðessem atorn dy spal e tenoy a descendr sur peyan sdruçollabr.
Aldric pulled his brown robe closer about his shoulders and continued downhill over slick cobblestones.
