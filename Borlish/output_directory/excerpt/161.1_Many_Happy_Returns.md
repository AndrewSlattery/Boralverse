161.1: Many Happy Returns

excerpt in translation from a conversation on the streets of Manster township of Utter Safford, Markland [1], on Friday the 13th of March 2020.

"Ou ave, Ben! Jo n'ay te vis posc larc semman—Torn all'An Allagr! Increibr no's y temp ou nos caint cos nuvr?"
“Oh wow, Ben! I haven’t seen you in weeks—happy New Year! Can you believe the weather we’ve been having?”

"Carrow! Ajoutað de te quinar—or vis ay jo stað aval a Runkhorn a mesur de toð y gaviscenç, oc me soumonent ne vertað, me valois ne bon mont lign fait ag çod enter jusc oy—Martha e tey ou son cavibr je Mart?
“Carrow! Lovely to run into you—I’ve actually been downstream in Runkhorn for the festivities, which reminds me, actually, I should have quisted the whole crew by now really—are you and Martha free on Tuesday?

Nos voum un picq sorty scenar je l'osceyan de Jacq cas nous, nien dy reloðessem. Sauf ig sey Martha ja pretenent a toð y noit passar coll'eç Duvlinner, lon digr."
We’re having a little sorty for Jack’s birthday at ours, nothing too fancy. Unless Martha’s already planning to spend all night with the Dubliners, of course.”

"Zo jo seray raut de la assistr—ja, Matt a famigl ac convoccar des toð loy por y spectacr de lumner, ma prefaibr es ig i nil se cavir meyon gehennað avant sell'aldr scey calscon, haha!
“Oh I’d love to come down—yeah, Matt’s got family in from all over for the light shows, but she probably won’t want me embarrassing her in front of the parents in any case, haha!

Donc Jacq sera ben, ja vegnt dou eld, bon Deu—ma paus, comoscon sceus jo Jacq connoscr un dezein lon descovrir ig cay sell'osceyon je Sant Patriç? My bel paðr dign Patriç, m'orruð ig stou all'oc smargr ne collocq."
So Jack’ll be what, twenty-two already, goodness—wait, how have I known Jack for a tenyear and not found out his birthday’s on Patrick’s Day? My father-in-law’s called Patrick, I feel as though this should have come up.”
