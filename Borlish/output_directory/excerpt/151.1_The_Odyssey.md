151.1: The Odyssey

excerpt in translation from the beginning of the Odyssey, as translated into prose Borlish from the original Epic Greek by Rosctey Villautin in 1910. The translation has been criticised for hewing too closely to the Greek syntax at the expense of sounding natural in Borlish.

D'un segr racont mey, Mus, mout tornant, oc magn lað
Of a man tell me, Muse, often turning, who very widely

sgarant, posc y citað sagntað a Troy i devastau;
wandered, after the holy city of Troy he sacked;

dy larc hom seyon vis, dy ment den seyon connuð
of the many people he saw, whose minds he knew

e dy larc cos sur mar seyon souvað e caut ny cour,
and of the many things at sea he endured and took to heart,

gimmolent kireðam a sy við eð ag repaðr de sy commilton.
striving wholeheartedly for his life and his comrades' homecoming.

Ma noc cossy sceus i sy commilton errevir, meðes auvorn oblimant;
But not like this could he save his comrades, even longing to so much;

lou desig lorry fol temertað il perisceurn;
they, for their foolish recklessness, perished;

borel, eç des y kiveu dy sol Hyperion
fools, who from the herd of the sun Hyperion

ayent repasc fait e lor i lou effurau deur y jorn de repaðr.
dined, and so he deprived them of the day of homecoming.
