108.1: Sandrine

excerpt in translation from notes on the history of sandrine (Vitamin C).

Cossy sceint, frugt sta conservað par mejan lorry matier sandrinal eliminant (com bustr, par boglir ben benoç de vas ne cuivr) e donc moðnaut sofren de scurvog toð cas, ig colluy indugnt vars plu frugt bacagettar enter.
Thus, fruit would be preserved in ways which removed their sandrine content (for example, boiling or use of copper vessels) and sailors would suffer scurvy anyway, leading guilds to abandon stocking fruits altogether.

Un grap theoretic cos vray nole avenir pre siecr settoç, candon sceye descovart par bonaventur ig laprot guy poun doutr scurvog accarr (human e guy son soltumnesc parmy l'œcumen animal cas noc poðir sandrin detaxionnar cos autonom des çucar).
Truly theoretic understanding would not come until the seventeenth century, when it was discovered by chance that the guy-coney can also develop scurvy (humans and guys are rare among animals in not creating sandrine in our bodies from sugar).

L'oc parmettoy experienç fort scrutiniosessem eð expediðessem sur guy, por y bon ploghanç de frugt e leum discernir par effectualtað cas scurvog coïr.
This allowed for much more rigorous and time-efficient testing on guys, to determine what preparations of fruits and vegetables were effective at preventing scurvy.

All'yenç dy siecr ogtoç sta l'issar usual denuð saf a limmon sdroyar diluïð com lembic starc durant veyaç marin lonc.
By the 1700s it had become common practice to stock lemon juice diluted with strong alcohol on long sea voyages.
