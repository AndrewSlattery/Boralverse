160.1: Slippery Creatures

excerpt in translation from the beginning of (IRL) pulp historical Slippery Creatures, written by KJ Charles.

Theo Carin er caut sou siesc par livr.
Will Darling was outnumbered by books.

Noc jug no'r i sentent cossy.
It hadn’t always felt this way.

Candon l'au primer sell'yam visitað cas Carin por Antic e Rediveu, i n'au for ig stimað Ac scein stroy de livr, e candon i fo ençað a martel ac prendr, il intermanen for hayen.
When he’d first visited his uncle at Darling’s Used & Antiquarian, he’d simply thought That’s a lot of books, and when he’d started helping here, they were just work.

Tandic l'accare gournanç sull'edifiç durant l'egrtumn final de sell'yam, interim, i dene a mesur coðelosessem den eç l'incombiscent atorn, emplið par saivenç e secret e mençon.
As he took over the running of the place in his uncle’s last illness, though, he became increasingly aware of them looming around him, full of knowledge and secrets and lies.

Aðief por ig, candon Yam Theodor fo mort, Theo memorau un refrain ataval de costumn cas avegl, e l'au y voç se hoccovað lor y livr allocquað con "L'es egreut."
So much that, when Uncle William had died, Will remembered an ancient piece of lore about bees, and he’d cleared his throat and told the books, "He’s gone."
