9.1: A Complete Woman

translated from Una Complerta (A Complete Woman), a 1902 trevold written by Vascon-born Valencian Gonçala Jaubèt, occupying a transitional place between the obsolescent genre of sojourner tales and the newer housebound ænigmata.

Ða l'aus un curtel frivol cossirabr posseïð lor plausibr sta i volois le triað por aziar fier accougl, ma i no l'aye.
If she’d owned a gown that could be called frivolous she might have selected it to demonstrate solidarity, but she did not.

I mis sy collar y reloðessem, un rascou ne perl gran luy dað com bricot de Hulda, e pastisceu cos leger l'idea d'y magð assignar a sy cavel compondr n'un form minutiosessem, ma toverstau.
She donned her best necklace, a grain-pearl rascow [choker] that had been a gift from Hulda, and toyed with the idea of asking the maid to arrange her hair into something more elaborate, but lost her nerve.

No sceye un sorty for insolemn. Conrad vole creir ig i sta fol denuð. Par sell'obstinacy tardisceu i jusc surcair y derran a entrar ny salon.
It was only an informal sorty. Conrad would think she’d run mad. Her reluctance delayed her to the point that she was the last into the parlour.

Ja scey casc autr hom, casc gent taçoirn, e l'atmospher cant l'aulau afont portau toll'exuberanç fujonner d'un torvegl.
Everyone else was there, everyone was silent, and the atmosphere as she walked in had all the joie de vivre of a thunderstorm.
