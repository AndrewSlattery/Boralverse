185.1: The Zenda Manuscript (cont.)

continued translation from the beginning of [real-life] book The Henchmen of Zenda by KJ Charles, a 2018 pastiche of the 1894 romp The Prisoner of Zenda.

Jo dign Jasper Detchard, e lonc y narrað de Rassendyll jo so mort.
My name is Jasper Detchard, and according to Rassendyll’s narrative I am dead.

L'oc derra vos orruðar sy tranqment mesurar, dað ig jo no so l'ec parol dictant all'oregl d'un benoyour a fler de caul des dereðr dy sougl.
This should give you some idea of his accuracy, since I do not dictate these words to some cabbage-scented medium from beyond the veil.

No scey alcun dout ig jo sera mort prell'hour yon alcun hom lein l'ec fougl—
There is no doubt that I will be dead by the time anyone reads these pages—

—veram, sontic cos absoluð es ig l'oc sey cossy, dec my tesmogn vel y gehen ou d'un condamnment magn stendiscent ben d'un cug magn abrejað me sbolognar, e par surcresc se poð y doum d'un reyaum desvey deut a my parol.
—in fact, it is absolutely necessary that should be the case, as my words would earn me the inconvenience of a very long prison sentence or a very short drop, and moreover the fate of a kingdom could be swayed by my words.

Ma jo remain, cant jo scau, veunt, vige, e vexað.
But I am, as I write, alive, well, and irritated.
