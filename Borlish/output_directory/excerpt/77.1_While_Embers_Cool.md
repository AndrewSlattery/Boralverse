77.1: While Embers Cool

excerpt in translation from spycraft trevold While Embers Cool (originally written and published in Welsh as Pan Oera'r Glo), 1889 work by Hasinick author Kjartan Rhysvor.

Toll'emendanç por y mas son complið, jusc oy, ða vray meðes a i y ci dou rig d'ardois derran allignað cos scaðr.
The repairs to the farmhouse are all done, now, if he really did get those last two rows of slates lined up right.

Posc veg yon final i se descen y gas des nuot vars fastig, oc parisc sigt dijarbr.
When he finally lets his gaze drop from the clouds to the roof, it looks decent.

Noc just exact com valent, nentamen: l'eç ardois aun untal nuvreç eð aplattið ant cogn parfait y catr.
Not quite like it should, though: the slates are so unmistakably new and uniform with perfect corners.

Scey ne bon mont fragnç e lamn jagottað a casc postion yonoscon y glaç joivrau ne japot tras l'yarn e bojau l'ardois a vougheç.
There should be cracks and uneven edges in all the spots where the ice dammed up in the winter and pushed the slates awry.

Ma toð ig es partið. Cay comoscon ða toð ci annað ern diglað, ben ða alcun cainç den n'er bogr occors.
But all that is gone. It is as if all those years have been erased, as though none of it had happened at all.
