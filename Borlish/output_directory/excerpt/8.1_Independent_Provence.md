It is also supposed—Amigòt did not do us the service of keeping a chronicle—that his rule lasted eighteen years to allow Menton to ensure his chosen successor enjoyed near-unanimous support of the Concert, the Provincial legislative house modelled after the Venetians'.

His first choice Raimond Aurellex, who had married his youngest sister and whose brother Lohis had died leading the charge at the Battle of Satillew, died in a hunting accident in 1511 (and despite the popular understanding, this particular incident was likely not an assassination).

In the end, the Concert elected Menton's cousin Antoin Amigòt to lead the Concert under the close attention and martial guidance of daus Sanz, through whom Daniel Menton doubtless exercised his influence long after his nominal stepping down.
