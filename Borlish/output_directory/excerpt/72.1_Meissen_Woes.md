72.1: Meissen Woes

excerpt in translation from an 1813 letter sent by Dorothe Shock to her mother Johanne.

Y bourgmer parman n'aiçar de camin ottem vars l'ovest la Lepcy—
The mayor continues to promise better roads out west to Lepzi—

mocry es ig se poð noc l'aðendranç quottar entr ort eð occas e donc stou un noit incommod souvar ag casatabr solter d'Ossatz ant magð a cambr supportabr.
it is nonsensical that one cannot make the journey in a day and must suffer an uncomfortable night in the only Ossatz lodginghouse with tolerable chambermaids.

Jo porray noc creir ig tal corrogation veun patronisment se trovar tandic y garnçon sein sell'aur flagitant,
I cannot see that such projects will find funds for themselves so long as the garrison demands its gold,

e tandic y menaç bohamesc sey tijon svingant dereðr dy tarm souðer.
and so long as the Bohamish menace rattles sabres across the southern border.

Y clavir a y joun Walter hamtað ant zeltað a plaç de sparteç; ja neðan cay noc tan foudent freit tras port oc posseu nos eir allors deull'yevot de sy heloit!
Young Walter has taken to the clavier with zeal if not skill; would that it were not this damned cold outside and one had somewhere to go out of his earshot!
