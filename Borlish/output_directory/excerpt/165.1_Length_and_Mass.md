165.1: Length and Mass

notes in translation on lengths and masses in the dime system of measures.

Scein tre font cas y lonctumn degm: y polç, y pie (10 polç) eð y lau (10⁴ pie).
There are three bases for dime lengths: the inch, the foot (10 inches) and the league (10⁴ feet).

Nell'enç, y lonctumn dy pie denoy fis cos quidam naðusc com y mojol entr y "pie romannesc" eð y "paum accenser" Cathayan, stant un picq pog inequal.
At first, the length of the foot was fixed somewhat arbitrarily as the midpoint of the very slightly different Roman foot and the Cathayan "surveyor's span".

D'an 1946, y pie sta redefinið por ig y veloçtað normal din equal cos exact a deg gran lau par second.
In 1946, the foot was redefined to make the speed of light equal to precisely ten great leagues per second.

Bempart autr mesur a lonctumn pouvler receveurn valour degm.
Several other traditional measures of length were given dime values.

Com bustr, cas y mesur degm y mil val cinq mil pie ben demy d'un lau.
For instance, in dime measures the mile is equal to five thousand feet or half a league.

Scein catr font cas y moul degm: y scrupol, l'onç (100 scrupol), y taber (100 onç) eð y ton (100 taber).
There are four bases for dime hefts: the scruple, the ounce (100 scruples), the tabre (100 ounces) and the ton (100 tabres).
