6.1: A Merch Castle

excerpted in translation from trevold Children of the Battle of Rexam, written in 1931 by schoolteacher Jon Paldreth.

Noc obstroint l'er fait pog martial de character, Andreu ant sy ment indeslocabr a jainç e sepostion nonscalent vars tact naðeu vole dar ig jo fos incaint a carceration souvar entr y mur dy Castel Safford lon tarm, ben fin a i sceus me benoçar megl.
Though he was not particularly martial-minded, Andrew's uncompromising tactical nous and cavalier disregard for simple diplomacy meant I would likely languish as a prisoner at Safford Castle indefinitely, or until he could put me to some better use.

Val pog; y cambr sta calt cos bel degnant y morostað de janver tras port, ant un foy kirtant eudæmon sou tapeçment lonc un victoir markesc ancour descreint—j'appone—tandy y pardastr afont no sta bogr discernibr.
No matter; the room was warm despite the January gloom outside, a merrily-crackling fire under a long tapestry depicting—I assumed—another Merch victory, though it was anyone's guess against whom. 

Ag mur atras, jo saveu des y clartað dy ci quarrel ig il forn cos recent affis all'oc ans veil, accas plausibr ne carganç des y hal dy praxitel bavarn.
On the other wall, the clarity of the panes suggested they were a recent addition to this old wing, possibly commissioned from the Bavarn masters.

Allors aye jo plusour fenestr parceut y veðr zajadau dy siecr derran tenent tojorn, un vert obægr surcaint just inequivalibr par y lumner a tijon.
Elsewhere I had noticed many windows still held the jackdaw glass of the previous century, in a sickly green that could not quite be offset with torchlight.
