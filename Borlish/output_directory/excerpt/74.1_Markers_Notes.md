74.1: Marker's Notes

excerpt in translation from censor commentary on the 1985 scitation paper Consequences of Viking Statecraft.

Sporadichessem ma n'alcun cas malvenuð sta argutar a them d'eiðel normant, yon vars sy vigeïtað aurn bempart hom saut enter;
Less common but by no means unwelcome was discussion of the Normans, to whose relative prosperity many left Sodrick entirely;

defagl es l'auvorntað dy depouvlançment kerennar ma nos leum bon argument plusour sull'eç panel.
the extent of the depopulation is difficult to quantify but we read several good arguments along these lines.

Destegnt particuler es l'un stuðant; y doncel avacau a bustr tesmogn suajoir effojar de fraðr trellinc, nað a Moul tor 915 N,
Of particular note is one student; she managed to find convincing records of triplet brothers, born in Mull around 915 N,

e svoccað alcheðr par referenç vars gazou normant sur Marsella d'an 946 N.
and mentioned again in reference to a Norman raid of Marsella in 946 N.

Decevent naðusc sta pog candidat sceurn l'aggressour Duncloð apportar n'assaut con alcun carn—
It was somewhat disappointing that few respondents mentioned the aggressor Dunclothe in any detail—

—noc obstroint ig y stovenç a poið temporane suffibr deur y gravatoir ne Tremonou ren y cort de Rodric travodar defiant assað.
—notwithstanding the lack of decent contemporary sources outside the Tremonnow archives makes discussing Roderick's court a challenge.
