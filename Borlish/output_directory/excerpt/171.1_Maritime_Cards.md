171.1: Maritime Cards

notes in translation on the subject of the Maritime deck of cards, which have five suits: gold, bucklers, staves, jewels and arrows.

Doutr allors, magn entr y blad aun cas ustol un dob desjognt deur lorry step eð ensign—com bustr, y dou de verc dign y Duel, cant y set de jovel es connuð com y Constellaçon.
Many of the cards furthermore have conventional titles separate to their rank and ensign—for example, the deuce of staves is called the Duel, while the sept of jewels is known as the Stars.

Tras asc y composson sull'ec blad son ençað a l'ec aspect noçonal sousumir.
Over time the artwork on these cards has come to incorporate these thematic elements.

Ne joy yon certan blad contrdontn toð autr, l'ensign d'aur luïsc cos usual l'oc sona, interim pieç joy modernessem se sarviraun dy blad "dobað" soumont amont cossy.
In games where some cards trump the rest, the gold ensign typically takes this role, but some more modern games will use the aforementioned "named" cards in this way.

Y benoç d'un pachet Maritim por y ventur preveir scavr bempart autr poið d'arveiðrostað, ma meðes l'issar occult e modern n'aun lorrell'origin for ny siecr novoç primal.
The use of a Maritime deck for divination mirrors many other sources of randomness, although the modern occult practices only date back to the early nineteenth century.
