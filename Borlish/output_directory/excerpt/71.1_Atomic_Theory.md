71.1: Atomic Theory

excerpt in translation from Lux Æterna: The First Century of Threshold Force, written in 2002 by Cawen ba Dirxen at the Varonøw Higher Edifice.

Des posc y preu enombranç corporal d'an 1840 er venuð all'idea oc orn dar a corporal cos naðeu lonc pondranç mena vars coglenç fatuous ða volir nis prestar a lorry natur alchemic
Since the first periodic tables in the 1840s it had been realised that naively ordering elements by atomic weight led to inelegant groupings when chemical properties were taken into account

(y celeberrem ig stove de raçon starc janthin inquillir parmy sy confraðr detaxional com muria),
(most notably the strong motivation to place iodine with similarly-reacting substances like chlorine),

eð alcun motivation theoretic por eç tal per de corporal trocar nell'orn nole soumission cavir pre dezein.
and no scientific basis for swapping such pairs of elements in the order would be proposed for decades.

A veg temporane, l'occorrenç pariscent lon conjogntur yonoscon ig lonc mesuranç y corporal y legeressem teyen tout pondranç atomic monfiað pres exact com l'ig a aquifex,
At the same time, the apparently-unrelated phenomenon wherein the lightest elements had all been measured to have atomic weights almost exact multiples of that of hydrogen,

cant oc se mantene bogr cas y ci lordessem (corporal tal cojan meðes com es cuivr!), flagita expostion cavir.
while this was not true at all of heavier ones (even such prosaic substances as copper!), demanded explanation.
