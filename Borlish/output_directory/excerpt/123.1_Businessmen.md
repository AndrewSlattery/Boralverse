excerpt in translation from a short story by @ghost-casket, with proper nouns altered to the new setting.

Plausibr, val Levy sey vexaðessem.
Probably, Levy should be more upset.

Plausibr es ig l'ay scoc jug. Bon ou?
Probably he is still in shock. Right?

He looks out of his taxi window (it's not technically a taxi, just some guy named Corry who offered him a ride to the airport, because cabs don't operate in fucking Tinyville, Bumfuck Middle-Of-Nowhere, Taisha) and tracks water droplets racing each other down the glass, because of course it's raining, and his bad knee is killing him. 

Levy fay snifr e frot y man sur ogl e soulor i sort sy dois e reserf un masctig por vol reunt a Santrafeu, broncant posc catr cent e veint seg tron se caun portað deur sy cont tesoral.
Levy sniffs and rubs at his eyes and then pulls out his phone and books a ticket back to Santrafew, wincing as four hundred and twenty-six trone are deducted from his bank account.
