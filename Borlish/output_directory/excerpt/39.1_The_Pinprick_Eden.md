39.1: The Pinprick Eden

excerpt from The Pinprick Eden, a work of parachthon romance released in 1911 Zangathy by Mica Lus, the first trevold from that Mendevan polity to be published in translation across the Vetomund.

Forn pog may a deg meis sceut des l'annihilaçon dy mont, e caye je sy nascenç.
It had been just over ten months since the end of the world, and it was her birthday. 

Kimmela au l'un je nascenç jubilað abord dy kenonaut deja, durant y gyr por mantien.
Kimmela had celebrated one birthday on board the voidsailer already, during the maintenance gyre. 

L'ig au un jorn teut con allagrtað e spien, e lor un sorty souvr no'r parið tesqual a bas a respirar.
That had been a day of happiness and hope, and throwing a party had seemed as natural as breathing. 

L'oc annað i poðe alcun jubilaçon vray dijarr lon jant.
This year she couldn't stomach any real celebration. 

Kimmela gasau pall'oscbou veðr vars y vogt semnað de stel atras.
Kimmela stared out of the viewport at the star-strewn void.

L'oc sta bel, de façon freit e mortal, ant stel noc lougent yon parmig splendisce y Sol ja briglandessem for com picq.
It was beautiful, in a cold and deadly way, with untwinkling stars among which already the Sun shone only slightly brighter. 

Se poðe y Tar foscað de fum fos visibr pall'appragl ny kenonaut, ma i douta.
The smoke-blackened Earth might yet be visible with the voidsailer's equipment, though she doubted it.
