31.1: 2-D Geometry

    excerpt in translation from the correspondence of Dewock Barclythe (1452-1539 N),Friar of Tremonnow; these lines are from a missive sent to his acquaintance Lluprando da Treviso at the University of Saint Marinus.

Quemant es locutionnar ig cas y plan d'Euclid, dou form mozað calscon son tojorn parallel, oc a digr il hamtn un plan parey.
It is good to remark that in the context of Euclid’s plane, all mozate forms are parallel, which is to say that they are coplanar.

L'oc parceuçon a nossy Jarleð menað all'apponment ig form mozað posn un ongit por asmuth posseïr innað, cos equal com se poð un tramou fornir con l'un asmuth des dou ouçon.
This observation has led our Jarleth to conjecture that mozate forms might possess themselves a sort of direction, in the same way that a line segment may be endowed with one of two directions.

L'ongit por asmuth y tesquallessem posseïbr par un form com circol ben scaðr es lon dout l'ongit aut par un orlosc soler.
The most natural sense of direction a form like a circle or square might possess is undoubtedly the sense of a sundial.

Calscon exact vel signfiar ig un cercol ay voltisc soler ben guyer, ne diagram defagl no’s l'oc voltisc depegntar; y vellisqment normal de saget benoçar suffig ac fort just com cas form lign.
Whatever precisely it should mean for a circle to be sunward or awkward, in diagram it is not difficult to depict; the usual expedient of arrowheads suffices as well here as it does for line forms.
