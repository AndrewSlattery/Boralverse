L'aer bisan de harvest feya mornç ag gien d'Evangelin cant i quaucau par Rout San Margaret, con sy mantel raffleyant dereðr.
The crisp autumn air nipped at Evangeline's cheeks as she hurried down St Margaret's Lane, her cloak billowing behind her.

The streets of London were alive with the bustle of merchants and carriages, and the scent of roasting chestnuts wafted from a nearby vendor's cart.

I clignau y picq pachet fassað ne papir broun contr sy peitrin, ogl lançant la por garantir ig l'oc remaneus fast.
She clutched the small parcel wrapped in brown paper to her chest, glancing at it to ensure it remained secure.

Cant l'approisma y torn vars Rout Hawthorn oc menant vars y livrer de Cavendish, un figur smargoy des vogt dy foscur.
As she approached the turn onto Hawthorn Street that led to Cavendish's bookshop, a figure emerged from the shadows.

Y domn sta cort naðusc eð i porta un curtel de bilrod plen, con sy visaç vellað par un capel nell'eutað e lað d'orlaç.
The woman was rather short and wore a dress of rich billrod, her face obscured by a fashionable wide-brimmed hat.
