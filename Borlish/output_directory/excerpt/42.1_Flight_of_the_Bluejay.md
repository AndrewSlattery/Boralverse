Michæl flaðrau l'immoubr yert vars y routel dessou, casc broit minuscr oyent com menaç.
Michael clambered down the building to the alley below, conscious of every tiny noise.

I save lon alcot vole Sara hour passar pre smarcr; sell'attent surcayen tor veint minut teir, e posc y fin parvenent den sy deit ern gelað e l'aye se convencuð ig y costojan ayent y rout follað trottant sta a pognt de retornar an moment calscon por l'accusar d'emboscment a flannar.
He had no idea how long it might take Sara to emerge; in the event it was about twenty minutes, by the end of which his fingers were icy and he was convinced that the policeman who had strolled along the street would be back at any moment to accuse him of lurking with intent.

Ma cos final i sta yent, accappelað e fassað de rob, con y valigs.
But at last she was there, in hat and coat, with the suitcase.

I l'oncau par pas plusour fin a Michæl smargoy deull'ombr e le prenoy de sy man.
