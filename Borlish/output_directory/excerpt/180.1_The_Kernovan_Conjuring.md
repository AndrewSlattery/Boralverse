notes in translation on the subject of the 1029 Kernovan Conjuring, by which Normandy  conquered Kent.

Con tan alcun bustr tesmogn d'un concort scaut sein survescuð, presunt es ig y Majon de Cornou soloy droug a Normandy par lorry gimmolt ag thron Cantuer com troc contr denir y novel dynasty regnant sur Magn Dorogn.
Although no references to a written treaty have survived, it is presumed that the House of Kernow aided Normandy in their bid for the Kentish throne in exchange for support in becoming the new ruling dynasty of Greater Devon.

L'oc squid er mantenuð, ma cayen for un per de dezein pre Magn Dorogn denoy un vassal sou y Preu Empir Drengoçan.
This bargain was upheld, but it only took a couple of decades for Greater Devon to become a vassal of the First Drengot Empire.

In what was either impressive long-term strategy or merely opportunism, the victorious Roger of Normandy would go on to conquer Kent's neighbours, including Essex and Markland, and then venture south to annex much of the rest of Gaul.

L'er coronnað com Emperour Roger I durant l'oc spanjon cas eiðel d'an 1038.
He was crowned Emperor Roger I in the midst of this territorial expansion in 1038.
