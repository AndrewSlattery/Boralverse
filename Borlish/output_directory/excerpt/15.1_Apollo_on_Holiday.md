Sengr a comparaçon sta y repasc cocinað par Gevel e Mothe pre Ludric fo repaðrið—lagç a lign con saus mentagler e leum.
The meal was a relatively simple one prepared by Gevel and Tim before Ludrick got home—stringlace with mince sauce and greens.

Y pan fo un pog bruslað atorn dell'orlaç ma y ligt gostan fort aðief por engollisc farvent valir, cos particuler posc untal jorn commovent.  
The bread was a little crispy on the edges but the rest was tasty enough to be worth scarfing down, especially after such an active day. 

Caye tan cæros prestabr yon vole Ludric toð novel de sy figl yembr.
It was also a great opportunity for Ludrick to catch up with his children.

"J'oy tu a un religion minour soluð," dis Ludric ag veðerrem dy figl.
“I hear you’ve started a minor religion,” Ludrick said to his middle child.

Gevel se dau scoul e gembondau cant sy fraðr fragns a ricottanç gesper. "Jo nole ac cair," dis i. "J'er fabr visant—"
Gevel pulled a face and groaned as her brother burst into breathless laughter. “I didn’t mean to,” she said. “I was aiming for drama—”

"Gent son oy tempr costroint sur scaðr platcouf," sceu Mothe digr, ant spal soccoðent.
“People are putting shrines up on rooftops now,” Tim managed to get out, his shoulders shaking.
