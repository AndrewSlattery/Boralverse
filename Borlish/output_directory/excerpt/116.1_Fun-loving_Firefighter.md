116.1: Fun-loving Firefighter

excerpt in translation from Mescainç ben Delit? "Accident or Crime?", one of a series of episodic stories about first responders in Damvath, published since the 1990s by a collective of Borlish authors.

Zaf er denuð quïscour dec apar l'aye l'occajon a foyaçar eð a gent aïðar veg temporane.
Zaf had become a firefighter because it let him show off and help people at the same time.

L'oc no sta bogr autrað; sull'oc, toð cas, aye i jamay y vertað dis.
That hadn't changed; that, at least, he had been truthful about.

I cof ancour l'ig ðougl meðes des y toxen oïr, des y vagn viglar con sy balis briglant e sy vagiscour hurlant, des port caugtrant deur lorry sougl—souvanç y gahaðasterrem de gent feirn sy cour battr. 
He still got the same rush from hearing the alarm, from driving the engine with its brilliant lights and screaming noisemakers, from kicking in doors—people's worst days made him feel alive.

L'ec sceusn solcið inquillir n'un hom incaindessem vars cuidanç de sey.
Someone more prone to self-reflection might have felt qualms about that.

A sgart calscon, y squadron encontraurn noc veram mort tal mout.
In any case, the crew didn't actually see deaths that often.

Nentamen, incoïbr sta cos sporadic ern y grabattour haft an pognt remot allors ny citað, ben ig un armanç cojan surcou un belem mortal.
Nevertheless, it was inevitable that sometimes the stretcher-bearers were occupied halfway across the city, or that a routine call turned deadly.
