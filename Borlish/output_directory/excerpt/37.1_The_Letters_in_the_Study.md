37.1: The Letters in the Study

excerpt in translation from 1899 housebound enigma 'The Letters in the Study', written by Iscombe author Cavra Herquet as an early and successful example of the genre.

Y heloit dy sorty ern affauðað an zoum remot candon Guilmet follau y galleir vogt ny manoir apar.
The noise of the party was a distant hum as Guilmet wandered through the empty corridors of the house.

I sovemblau con y deit lonc l'adornment plu nell'eutað, y motif convoluð tragçant par ogl.
She ran her fingers along the unfashionable wallpaper, tracing the intricate patterns with her eyes.

L'aye tojorn l'oc majon amað; l'oc er luy parið com un cas-sey-apart a mesur dy ci meis stival stendiscent entr period scholer, ci yonoscon sell'aldr quïscen y tombr sodal por poðir escapat fair tras Mendeva.
She had always loved this house; it had been like a second home to her during those long summer months between terms when her parents had shut the family home to go gallivanting across Mendeva.

I tornau par un cogn e lor yeme paus avant un portrait larc sy granpaðr depegntant.
She turned a corner and came to a stop in front of a large portrait of her grandfather. 

Y vesson reit noc obstroint, y segr ny pegntur luy apparisc magn; il ern meðes fornið d'ogl parey.
Besides the stiff dress, the man in the painting looked much like her; they even had the same eyes.
