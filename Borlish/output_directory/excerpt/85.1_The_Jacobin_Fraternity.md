More relevant to history (or at least to the good reader's moneypurse!) are the Order of Saint James, in whose name was built the Peninsular Monastery which overlooks the city.

Founded in the tenth century under the patronage of Amelia of Bruges, they were implicated in a popular uprising against Geoffry II and forced to flee to Borland in 1067.

Today the Order (with its modern name, the Jacobin Fraternity) is in the main known for its Jaibos breweries and for owning much of the land around the city, including the site of one of the ancient Roman bathhouses for which Axbane is named.
