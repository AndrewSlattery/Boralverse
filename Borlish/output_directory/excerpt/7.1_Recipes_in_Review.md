POR SONDAÇ: Zaquesc Select poll'Avegl Felaver, par Axel fi Magno
IN REVIEW: Selected Refreshments for the Social Bee, by Axel fi Magno

Y capel commet dant ag volum derran de fi Magno des sy rig a livr cocinancer Select nos affirm ig no scey necun festeul, crevoscr eurað ben raðunanç sengr eð amiabr stant inaðelibr par un ouçon sagaç des l'oc gið.
The introduction to fi Magno's newest entry in his renowned Selected series of recipe books assures us that no soirée, no carrow's-eve and no simple friendly get-together cannot be improved with a judicious choice from this volume.

Eð indeniabr es ig l'oc tom a un tagl y stent de sy vangard doblant cos fagl, may a 300 method contenent ant tout entr tatou yarcer e scadom vorpal sur bachet.
And indeed, this tome is easily twice the size of any of its predecessors, containing over 300 recipes with everything from haskent tover to stack-die shadomes.

Vray fos jo my deut fugnt ða jo n'aus certan dell'eç method attis a cogr com mey; y kyriel a kynous appos par fi Magno ig vos arreð sou man no's irraçonabr demay, ma meðes ci parmy vous sceindessem derim posn desirar y vanc mar kiglar.
I would have been remiss not to try making a few of these recipes for myself; the range of ingredients that fi Magno supposes you have available is not too unreasonable, although those further inland may wish to avoid the seafood.
