34.1: Wearing a Mask or a Suit

extract in translation from Ezio Carvallo's 1860 trevold Tejan de Masquira ou Jalico "Wearing a Mask or a Suit".

Ny dal dessou splendisce y floy l'arrimbandant con azauc, tandic repars dereðr stan y collin parmy crevoscr raðunant.
In the valley below, the river shone like a ribbon of quicksilver, while on the far side the hills were lost in the gathering dusk.

pog lumner lougen dagaðy, ma il sarven soul a y vogdeç dell'œcumen remartellar.
A few lights twinkled here and there, but they only served to emphasize the emptiness of the land.

Matthias soupirau eð ençau tornant a rentrar, ma paravant l'yeme a parcevet cavir d'uncos movent tras l'ombr dy ci arbr.
Matthias sighed and turned to go back inside, but not before he caught a glimpse of something moving in the shadows of the trees. 

Ne sgardant de cur may, l'oc surcou un segr pariscent y camin follar nacleu deur y floy. Matthias forrovau; luy souvenen noc y sigt d'alcun najel hormejað ag quarf, eð y floy trasir ceter vel lontan par najar.
Looking closer, it resolved itself into a man, who seemed to be making his way up the path from the river. Matthias frowned; he didn't remember seeing any boats moored at the landing, and it was a long way to swim.

Y segr sera donc un vecin, ac yent por sbay dar ag forannour.
The man must be a local, come to gawk at the foreigners.
