32.1: A Bookshop

another excerpt in translation from the first chapter of Clarissa Bellamy's 1920 work A Door, Once Opened.

Y livrary meðes aye galleir streit e darsoval, ant scaffal anneyað par tout entr picq descovannet e rig enter emplið de tom lort.
The shop itself was cramped and maze-like, with shelves overflowing with everything from pamphlets to great collections of heavy tomes. 

L'aer aye fler de papir eð encost, malgrað i manca y brum pouvrous figurað par Fred, e lumner aurfiað dy crevoscr accenoy y roum par y ci fenestr larc a jos rout.
The air was redolent of paper and ink, though it lacked the dusty haze Fred had expected, and golden evening light illuminated the space through the shop's large street-facing windows. 

Ny cogn jagerrem sceye un gran tablaur gaubanneresc eð un caðer a reðrtien haut ados, eð ag mur ados ancour penoy un cart citaðer immanessem a toð ci jamay seyon vis.
In the far corner sat a large mahogany desk with a high-backed chair behind it, and on the wall behind that was hung a map of the city larger than any he had ever seen. 

jos y caðer azia y livrer, un picq livr nijommað par cogr vert closiscent e sgardant haut por bonjorn luy beudar.
By the chair stood the bookseller, closing a small book bound in green leather and looking up to greet him.
