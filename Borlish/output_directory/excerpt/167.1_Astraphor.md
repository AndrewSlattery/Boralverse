167.1: Astraphor

notes in translation on the subject of astraphor [electricity].

Astraphor (tan dignant forç barric) es y cougl d'occorrenç alligað con y presenç eð y locomoçon de soustanç plentivous, ben y nis harneisabr des tal locomoçon.
Astraphor (also called barric force) is the set of phenomena associated with the presence and movement of plentiful [charged] substances, or the thrift [energy] that one can harness from such movement.

The deep theoretical connection between astraphor and light was explored thoroughly in the mid-nineteenth century; the unimaginatively titled magnum opus Astraphor and Light by Merch theorist Wexter Hathwall managed to fully characterise the mechanics of astraphor in a single equation.

At this time, the earlier flag-lamp steeplemesh [telegraph] was in the process of being displaced by barric meshes.

Places without a pre-existing extensive flag-lamp system were in many cases faster to adopt the barric mesh; for example, by 1870 the world's longest wired post line on land spanned the length of Lower Mendeva [Central America].
