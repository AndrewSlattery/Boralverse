191.1: The Vanilla Manoeuvre

excerpt in translation from the 1992 trevold The Vanilla Manoeuvre (originally published in Merch under the title Tashban Tacks), written by Vendetta Boon, the granddaughter of Lord Runcibal Sawyer Boon, one-time Minster for Consequences in the Drengot Collusion. Of middling success, this spycraft work owes more to the film adaptations of the classics of the genre than to those classics themselves.

Y contris alandau n'un descovannet mejoncr, fait impacent sdruçollar tras y tabr.
The dossier arrived in a nondescript folder, shoved impatiently across the table.

Cattridge l'ovreu varsant eð examinau l'icon y quagl depegntant: un domn eld y carantein ant un sourey picq sousonnant a secret massem.
Cattridge flipped it open and studied the photograph of the target: a woman in her forties with a small smile that hinted at larger secrets.

Tre agent mort a mesur de tan semman, verim detaxionnað des fæx sougl—no se poðe l'oç panel mesveir.
Three dead agents in as many weeks, poisons derived from threshold dross—the pattern was unmistakable.

"I sera vos attenent ag fest cas l'ambasctour," dis y harvougl de Cattridge, ne sy jalicq vert cos martellað yauvnant.
"She'll be expecting you at the embassy reception," Cattridge's handler said, adjusting her aggressively green waistcoat.

"L'ambasctour Napolitan fay recougl de jarry d'Istr Boral pre-classic. Val l'eç effojaçon ne Çadrosc svoccar. I vil l'esc mordr."
"The Napolitan ambassador collects pre-Classical Borland ceramics. Mention the Çadrosc excavations. She'll take the bait."

Cattridge encromnau y fougl. A starn, doutr fenestr angost e meg argentfeyað, y ployot automnal ne Tommarth fey nuot a nimb teun dy lampader.
Cattridge pocketed the pages. Outside, through narrow and half-mirrored windows, Tommarth's autumn drizzle blurred the streetlamps into wan halos.

Allors, a plaç autr ny citað, un domn er se preparant por un fest yon i nole surveur.
Elsewhere, across the city, a woman was preparing for a party she wouldn't survive.
