28.1: A Door, Once Opened

excerpt in translation from the first chapter of Clarissa Bellamy's 1920 work A Door, Once Opened; the translation into Borlish was done by her friend Gunna Despath.

"Ac vespr, bossir," saluðau y livrer, y test ponent nacleu d'un façon stant cortal e conjuraçonnant y dou—a veg meðes solemn demay por un vocationner ma parcevent cos manifest demay por un actour doit. "Jo crey noc nos ayau acconnosc. Jo dign Brandon Cavendish."
"Good evening, sir," the bookseller said, inclining his head in a way that was both courtly and conspiratorial—at once too formal for a tradesman and too obviously self-aware for a trained actor. "I don't believe we've met before. I'm Brandon Cavendish."

"Frederick Walton, thein vostr," respos Frederick, y man offriscent. Y pogn de Cavendish sta sec e freit, luy man soccoðent cos starc lon skassar.
"Frederick Walton, at your service," Frederick replied, extending his hand. Cavendish's grip was dry and cool, his handshake firm without being crushing.

"Soð vos ac por gilaçar, Sr Walton, ben n'un tom particuler tenent all'idea?"
"Are you here to browse, Mr Walton, or did you have a particular volume in mind?"

"Nien de tal apprestment," dis Frederick. "Jo so nuvr alandað des Goring e donc un novel misol a leir recarnt auvorn."
"Nothing so planned," Frederick said. "I am recently arrived from Goring and in dire need of some new reading material."

"Lor soð vos venuð ag bon varous," dis y livrer par un sourey plait. "Vel jo te mostrar ig noscon vençað."
"Then you've come to the right place," the bookseller said with a smile. "Let me show you what we have."
