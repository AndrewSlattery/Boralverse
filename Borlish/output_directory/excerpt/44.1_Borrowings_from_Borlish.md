44.1: Borrowings from Borlish

excerpt in translation from Daughters of the Sea: The Northwestern Isles, written in 1956 by Merch author Challow Huddresfell.

Nossy vecin all'aust n'aun jamay y pinnacr mont respanent acavar dy gent Breðon cas asteller e foyer.
Our neighbours to the east have never matched the globe-spanning workshop and household vanguard of the British.

Nentamen, ða meðes par proximtað soul, y lengaç anglesc son cos parmanent vanagl borallesc adaptant de jaçol com y Mitað-Asc.
Nonetheless, if only by virtue of proximity, the English languages have been adapting Borlish terms even from the medieval period.

Com bustr, degnant ig nos ligau y ci siecr tost nell'Istr posc-roman con migration des Albion vars Istr Boral (cos particuler, par issent dy reduction markesc d'Anglia Auster ny siecr nouf),
For example, while we associate the early centuries of the post-Roman Isles with migration from Albion into Borland (in particular, after the Merch subjugation of East Anglia in the ninth century),

eç parol com danny "un treublant, applattiscent", bather "baðr con fil" e parren "sojornour, un alandað, corrovað" entraurn Veðr Anglesc des Veðr Boral ny siecr deg soul (lonc lour y preu yenç ne chronic de monastir).
words like danny "a nuisance, an irritating person", bather "stringed musical intrument" and parren "traveller, newcomer, novice" enter Old English from Old Borlish in the tenth century alone (according to their first attestations in monastic chronicles).
