205.4: barricheyar "electrify"

barricheyar /ˌba.riˈkjar/ [ˌba.ʀɪˈkjɐː]
- power, hook up, to connect to a source of electricity;
- electrify, charge, to power by means of electricity;
- galvanise, energise, thrill, excite, to render delighted or eagerly anticipatory;
- shock, zap, to cause electricity to pass through (as to cause pain or death)

Etymology: nineteenth century, verbal derivative with the causative suffix -eyar < Latin -idiō, -izō "I make _" from adjective barric "electric" (formerly also a noun, now displaced by astraphor "electricity", from Greek). This in turn entered Borlish during the previous century, originating in Arabic رْق • barq "lightning". In metaphorical or emotional use the word is attested almost at once.
