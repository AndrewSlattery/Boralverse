37.4: fouceur "handsome"

fouceur /fuˈtsawr/ [fʊˈtsa.wɐ]
- handsome, pretty, having a pleasing appearance and especially (of a person) being physically attractive;
- charming, charismatic, exuding personal charm and inducing people around to like one;
- (archaic or affected) wily, sneaky, full of clever tricks making one difficult to keep up with or predict

Etymology: from Middle Boral, originally in the last sense as an attributive use of the (now-obsolete) noun fouceur "rascal, trickster". This reflects Old Boral fo(r)cevr "rogue, blackguard", a direct descendant of Latin furcifer "scoundrel, (derogatory) slave", literally "yoke-bearer". The shift in sense from "deceptive > wily > charming > handsome" is somewhat extreme, yet every stage (occurring over approximately two centuries from 1650 to 1850) is well-attested in the historical record.
