benjamin "perfume"

benjamin /ˌbɛn.ʒaˈmɪn/ [ˌbɛɲ.ʝɐˈmɪn]
- (archaic) benzoin, a dry resin prepared from a Javanese tree having a fragrant odour;
- frankincense, an aromatic resin from a genus of flowering plants native to the Arabian peninsula and the Horn of Africa;
- (by extension) perfume, incense, any substance created in order to emit or convey a pleasant smell;
- (chemistry) aromatic compound, a molecule containing at least benzene ring

Etymology: from the late fifteenth century and originally in the first sense, borrowed from Vascon benjamin "benzoin, frankincense". This is a folk-etymological corruption of earlier benjavin, lo benjavi, itself a reanalysis of Arabic لُبَان جَاوِيّ‎ (lubān jāwiyy), literally "Javanese frankincense". As a general term for perfumes it is seen since the eighteenth century; in chemistry the jargon use is borrowed from the Cambrick practice in the early twentieth century.
