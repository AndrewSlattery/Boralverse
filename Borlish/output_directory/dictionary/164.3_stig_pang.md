164.3: stig "pang"

stig /stai/ [stai]
- stitch, a stabbing pain in the side caused by exercise or laughter;
- ache, pain, spasm, paroxysm, any similar sensation of pain;
- pang, throe, a sudden outburst of a negative emotion

Etymology: from Old Borlish stii, stiȝ "stitch, stabbing pain", a borrowing from synonymous stiġe in Borland Old English. This is a variant of stiċe "stitch", which descends from Classical German sticis "prick, poke, a sticking". For more general pains the word is attested since the sixteenth century, and for emotions it is seen soon afterward.
