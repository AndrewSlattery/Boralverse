Etymology: first seen in Old Boral n(e) acliv /n aˈklɪw/ "uphill", an adverb formed by the fusion of preposition ne "in" with acliv < Latin acclīvis "sloped, rising, steep". To explain the early broadening also to "downhill, sloped downward", some have suggested influnce from a word *decliv < dēclīvis "sloping downward", but this is not attested in Old Boral text.

In the Middle Boral period the word quickly gains traction as an adjective (the metaphorical extensions to "awry, off course" occurring in both parts of speech simultaneously). As a noun it only overtakes now-obsolete appent "slope" < appendr "to lean, tilt" in the seventeenth century.
