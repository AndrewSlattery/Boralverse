111.2: guy "guinea pig"

guy /gaj/ [gaj]
- guinea pig, mammal of the genus Cavia;
- (obsolete) fool, simpleton, a mindless person;
- (archaic) greenhorn, novice, beginner, an inexperienced person;
- dude, bloke, chap, a man and especially a younger man

Etymology: a clipping of fuller laprot guy (/laˈprɔt ˈgaj/ [lɐˈpʀɔt ˈgaj]), literally "guy-coney". This is a seventeenth-century calque of Vascon conill guy (/gi/; the earlier /gwi/ was altered by analogy to the unrelated name "Guy"), which comes via Morrove [Maghrebi] Arabic from Run'allo [Quechua] quwi "(female) guinea pig". In its derogatory senses it is attested from the late eighteenth century; as a general term for young men, from the mid-twentieth.
