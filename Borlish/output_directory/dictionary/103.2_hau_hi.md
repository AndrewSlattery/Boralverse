103.2: hau "hi"

hau /ho/ [ho]
- hi, hey, hello, an informal greeting;
- hey, oi, a way to get somebody's attention

Etymology: in the first sense, a continuation of Middle Borlish hauð! "hello, good day", literally "health". The word hauð "health", now archaic, was borrowed in the Old Borlish period from synonymous hǣlþ in contemporary English. The form and informality of the greeting have been influenced by the second sense, which is probably of onomatopeic origin.
