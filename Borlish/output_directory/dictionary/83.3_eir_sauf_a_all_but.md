83.3: eir sauf a "all but"

eir sauf a /ir sof a/ [ɪː sof a]
- come close to, all but, almost, to go nearly so far as to do something

Etymology: idiom literally "to go except to", first attested in the fifteenth century. The verb eir "to go" descends directly from Latin eō "I go", while the preposition sauf "except" is slightly problematic. The regular descendant of Latin salvus "free (of)" should be sau; the final -f may be due to influence from Old French.
