Etymology: late Middle Boral borrowing from contemporary Merch chammock "pulp, jam". This is presumably a derivative of verb chammen "chew, chomp", which is thought to be of imitative origin. In figurative use it derives from the use of jam to sweeten bitter medicines.

The idiom dates to the eighteenth century, literally "jam to convention".
