115.2: trasson "transit"

trasson /traˈsɔn/ [tʀɐˈsɔn]
- transit, crossing, an instance of something moving across or through something else;
- transition, change, the process of change from one state to another;
- link, bridge, connection, anything placed between two distinct sections

Etymology: formerly trasçon, either a Middle Borlish noun derivation from trasir "to cross, traverse", or a direct borrowing from Latin trānsitiō "transit, transition". In the last sense the word is attested from the seventeenth century, originally applied to parts of musical compositions.
