- homeland, hometown, origins, the place where one was born or which one considers to be home;

Etymology: via Old Boral orin, oriȝn "breeding, heritage" from Latin orīgō, orīginem "commencement, origination, (particularly) birth", from which also comes the later reborrowing origin "source, origin, beginning". Used metonymically to refer to the place of one's birth since the fourteenth century.
