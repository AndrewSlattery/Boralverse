83.2: narreyar "taunt"

narreyar /ˌna.riˈjar/ [ˌna.ʀɪˈjɑː]
- taunt, mock, make fun of, to say or do something which makes someone seem foolish;
- goad, provoke, to cause someone to respond to you annoyed or angry;
- (intransitive) jest, fool around, to tell jokes or otherwise act in a comedic manner

Etymology: via Old Boral nariȝar "to taunt, goad" from Vulgar Latin nāricō "I snort", related to nārēs "nose". Respelt in the Modern Boral period by conflation with narr "fool, jester, joker", which was borrowed some centuries earlier from Germanic (cf. Saxon narr "wildcard; maverick").
