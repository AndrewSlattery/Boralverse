33.2: çavel "brain"

çavel /tsaˈvɛl/ [tsɐˈvɛw]
- brain, brains, organ of the human or animal body responsible for perception, cognition and memory;
- intellect, mind, the capacity for intelligent or rational thought;
- (botany) pith, the soft and spongy white matter on the interior of a plant

Etymology: descending from Old Boral cea(r)vel, cerbel "brain", and reflecting Latin cerebellum "little brain, intellect", a diminutive of cerebrum "brain, skull". In the last sense it appears to be a Revitalist-period calque, since the Latin etymon could also refer to a plant's pith.
