37.3: svattour "scout"

svattour /svaˈtur/ [zvɐˈtʊː]
- scout, a person or group of people sent out to perform reconnaissance or otherwise bring in information (especially in a military context);
- investigator, private detective, an agent hired by a person for the purpose of evidence gathering;
- harbinger, failsafe, early warning, a person or thing which gives advance notice (especially of danger or other unwanted occurrences)

also svattar /svaˈtar/ [zvɐˈtɑː] to scout, investigate, act as an early warning

Etymology: agent noun and verb from Middle Boral svat, svet "reconnaisance, scouting" (now obsolete), from synonymous early Saxon sweat /zvɛːt/. The word was borrowed in the thirteenth century, during the various conflicts subsequent to the German Secession. Extension from military contexts is attested in the eighteenth century, with its use by the svattour pavar private detectives of Damvath.
