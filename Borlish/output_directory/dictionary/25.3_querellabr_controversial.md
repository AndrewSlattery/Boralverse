25.3: querellabr "controversial"

querellabr /ˌkwe.rɛˈla.br̩/ [ˌkwe.ʀɪˈla.bɐ]
- controversial, contentious, characterised by or liable to cause argument;
- disputed, arguable, open to debate with respect to validity or genuineness

Etymology: potential adjectival derivation from verb querellar "to argue, debate, quarrel", itself derived from noun querel "dispute, argument, quarrel". This descends from Old Boral, borrowed from synonymous Old French querele, which reflects Latin querēla "complaint, grievance".
