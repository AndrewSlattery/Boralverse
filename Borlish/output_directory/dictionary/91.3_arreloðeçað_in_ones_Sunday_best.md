91.3: arreloðeçað "in one's Sunday best"

arreloðeçað /aˌre.lo.ðeˈtsaθ/ [ɐˌʀe.lʊ.ðɪˈtsah]
- in one's Sunday best, dressed to impress, wearing particularly formal or fashionable clothes;
- gussied up, tricked out, having many customisations or special features

Etymology: participle of arreloðeçar "to dress finely, to trick out", itself a verbal derivation from reloðeç "splendour; finery". This comes from reloð "fancy, refined", a descendant (with pleonastic re- seen already in the Vulgar period) from Latin lautus "washed; luxurious, splendid, fashionable".
