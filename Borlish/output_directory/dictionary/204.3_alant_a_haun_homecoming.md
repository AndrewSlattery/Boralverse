204.3: alant a haun "homecoming"

alant a haun /aˈlant a hon/ [ɐˈlant a hon]
- landfall, the end of a sea voyage;
- homecoming, the act of returning to one's home;
- (by extension) safe habour, deliverance, sanctuary, respite, the attaining of a position of safety after an extended period of danger or uncertainty

Etymology: collocation originating in Kigman's fifteenth-century poetry, literally meaning "docking at a haven". The noun alant "landfall" is a deverbal from alandar "arrive, turn up, dock"; this was borrowed in the Old Borlish period from Old English ġelendan "approach, arrive". The noun haun "haven, port" was borrowed from Old Norse hǫfn "harbour".

The phrase was used by Kigman already to mean a return to a metaphorical homeland; it had become synonymous with safe places more generally by the end of the following century.
