costojar /ˌkɔs.toˈʒar/ [ˌkɔs.tʊˈʝɑː]
- protect, keep safe, defend, to provent harm coming to;
- preserve, maintain, to keep from any sort of degradation including the effects of time;
- police, patrol, regulate, to control or direct according to a given set of laws or principles

Etymology: from Old Boral, a verb derivation from costosc "protection, defence" which descends uncomplicatedly from Latin custōdia "safekeeping, custody". This etymon also gives Boral costojan "police officer" and costojal "defensive", as well as Kentish costage "imprisonment, captivity".
