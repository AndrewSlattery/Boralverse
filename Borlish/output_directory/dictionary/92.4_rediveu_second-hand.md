92.4: rediveu "second-hand"

rediveu /ˌre.diˈvaw/ [ˌʀe.dɪˈvaw]
- second-hand, used, (of goods) previously owned by someone else;
- clichéd, hackneyed, unoriginal, repeated often enough to become tiresome;
- trite, cheesy, tropey, (of writing) unreflectively and unskillfully reproducing common narrative elements

Etymology: borrowing from Latin redivīvus "resurrected, second-hand" modelled on vīvus > Middle Borlish veu "living" (now obsolete). Metaphorical extension is seen from the late eighteenth century.
