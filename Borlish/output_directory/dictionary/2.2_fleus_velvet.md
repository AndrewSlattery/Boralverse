2.2: fleus "velvet"

fleus /flawz/
- velvet, closely woven fabric with a thick short pile on one side
- any particularly smooth texture, especially as associated with luxury
- an orange liqueur similar in preparation to triple sec
- (cooking) coated in flour, of meat
- (slang) money, cash, when acquired illegally or dishonestly
- (child talk) teddy, stuffed animal

Etymology: the cloth sense is original, descending from Old Boral fleos et al. "fleece, wool pile", a borrowing from Old English flēos "fleece". Usage for velvet in particular seen from the fourteenth century, and extension to any luxurious texile or texture from the sixteenth.

The liqueur is a genericisation, originally used for the Fleus d'Arcabil mixer first manufactured in the early 19th century, which has entered common use in various languages. The criminal usage is roughly contemporaneous, apparently from Cappatian naval cant. The twentieth-century sense of "stuffed animal" is likely a loan translation from New Provincial vellut, which acquired that meaning some decades earlier.
