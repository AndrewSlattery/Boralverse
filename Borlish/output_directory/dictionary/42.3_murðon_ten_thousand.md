42.3: murðon "ten thousand"

murðon /mɪrˈðɔn/
- myriad, the number ten thousand;
- countless, a very great number

Etymology: from Old Boral murð, mirð "countless, very many; ten thousand" with the addition of then-productive augmentative suffix -on (from Latin nominal derivational suffix -ō, -ōnem). In turn this word is a semi-learned form via Late Latin mȳrias, mȳriadem from Ancient Greek μῡρῐᾰ́ς (mūriás) "ten thousand, countless".

The forms with <u> (reflecting [ʏ]) instead of expected <i> is unlikely to be any remnant of Hellenising Latin <y> /y/ (which was never common as far afield as Borland). More plausible is a sporadic labialising effect from the preceding /m/, also seen in words like mug < Latin mīca "crumb".

In the Old Boral period it is most often used indeterminately for any large quantity; its more specific sense returns to common use (initially in merchant accounts) in the thirteenth century.
