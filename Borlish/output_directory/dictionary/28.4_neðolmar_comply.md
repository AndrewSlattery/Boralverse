28.4: neðolmar "comply"

neðolmar /ˌne.ðɔlˈmar/ [ˌne.ðʊwˈmɑː]
- to yield, give in, surrender, to give oneself up into the power of an enemy;
- to conform, comply, submit, to act in the prescribed manner;
- to belong, match, fit in, to be in the proper place as part of a group

Etymology: first in the military sense from Old Boral noun neðvolm "surrender, capitulation", presumably from a Borland Old English word *niþfolm with a similar sense and literally meaning "down hands", from the gesture of lowering one's hands in order to display submission.

[ʒʊ ˈhɔ.jɐ nʊˈlɪː ʝɐˈme lʊː ˌne.ðʊwˈmɑː]
I'm afraid I'll never fit in with them.
