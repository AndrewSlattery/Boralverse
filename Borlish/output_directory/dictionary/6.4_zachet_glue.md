6.4: zachet "glue"

zachet /zaˈkɛt/
- adhesive, glue, a substance that binds things together
- (especially) mortar, grout, mixture of lime or cement, sand and water used in construction as a binding agent
- solder, easily-melted alloy, often of tin and lead, used to mend or join metal objects

Etymology: from the thirteenth century in Middle Boral zachet "mortar", a borrowing from Barcelon or Mostara zaqueta "mortar, cement". This comes from earlier lazaco, lazaqueta via reanalysis of the first syllable as the definite article, and is a borrowing from Andalus Arabic لَزَاق <lazāq> "adhesive, glue".

The rebroadening of the word to "adhesive" in later Boral has been used to suggest that zaqueta itself was once used more broadly, but there is no textual evidence of this. In its metallurgical sense it is seen from the eighteenth century as a clipping from zachet metal "metal glue".
