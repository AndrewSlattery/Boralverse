45.3: ollem "elm"

ollem /ɔˈlɛm/ [ʊˈlɛm]
- elm, (especially) wych elm, tree of the genus Ulmus with asymmetric leaves and small petalless flowers;
- (slang, sometimes derogatory) person from Pentrose, a port town on the south coast of Borland, especially in the context of regional rivalry or applied to someone of British descent

Etymology: via Old Boral olem "elm", apparently reflecting an unattested Insular Latin ulēmus as a variant of ulmus "elm" influenced by Kelt *lēm "elm". We also see forms such as olmair in the Old Boral period with the addition of suffix -air to denote a type of tree.

Use of the word as a demonym for Pentrose is in evidence from the nineteenth century (cf. the banner and nickname of the local lineball team) but likely predates it, given the historical prevalence of elm trees in the area.
