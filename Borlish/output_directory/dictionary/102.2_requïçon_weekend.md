102.2: requïçon "weekend"

requïçon /reˌkwaj.iˈtsɔn/ [ʀɪˌkwajˈtsɔn]
- weekend, the (usually two-day) break in the working week often including a holy day of rest;
- (religion) day of rest, Sabbath day, the period set aside for rest and worship

Etymology: originally restricted to religious use, borrowed from Latin requiētiō "rest, repose" and modelled on verb requïr "to rest, be comforted". This descends from related verb requiēscō "I rest, am supported" in Latin. In the modern era the three weekends Fri-Sat, Sat-Sun and Sun-Mon are recognised by law in Borland (in line with the rest of the former Drengot Collusion and many other polities).
