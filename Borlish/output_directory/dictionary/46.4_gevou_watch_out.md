46.4: gevou "watch out!"

gevou /geˈvu/ [gɪˈvu]
- (exclamation) watch out, beware, be careful, exhortation to remain safe by acting in a cautious manner;
- forewarning, heads-up, alert of upcoming danger given ahead of time;
- caveat, proviso, stumbling block, an exception or other awkward condition that is worth knowing about and may need working around

Etymology: first in exclamatory usage, borrowed in the seventeenth century from French phrase a gué vous "look out!" (later written together as gué-vous and used as an ordinary noun), literally "to (the) lookout, you!". The noun gué "watchman, vigil, lookout" descends from Old French, borrowed from the Frankish descendant of Classical German vactuō "watch, vigil".

The word's phonetic resemblance to the English word "careful" is coincidental.
