177.4: destourmar "demob"

destourmar /ˌdɛ.sturˈmar/ [ˌdɛ.stʊːˈmɐː]
- demobilise, demob, to release from military service;
- decommission, sunset, shelve, to cease supporting the use of or to replace with an updated version;
- (jocular) let go, axe, fire, to dismiss from a position of employment

Etymology: early modern Borlish derivation from the root tourm "troop; barracks", which conflates contemporary French tourme "platoon" and Dutch torem "fort". The word has been used metaphorically of products since the mid-twentieth century, and is seen in jocular use from around the same time.
