113.2: raspar "scrape"

raspar /raˈspar/ [ʀɐˈspɐː]
- scrape, scratch, graze, grate, rasp, to draw a sharp or rough object along a surface while exerting pressure;
- play, bow, to create sound on a string instrument by means of drawing a bow across a string

Etymology: twelfth-century borrowing from Old French rasper "scratch, grate", itself from synonymous hraspōn in Frankish. The extension to string playing, as well as the noun raspour "string player", is seen from the late sixteenth century.
