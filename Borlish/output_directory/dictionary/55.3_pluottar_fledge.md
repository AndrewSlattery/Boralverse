55.3: pluottar "fledge"

pluottar /ˌpli.ɔˈtar/ [ˌpli.jʊˈtɑː]
- fledge, (of a young bird) to grow feathers and thus be able to fly from the nest;
- metamorphose, (of an insect) to mature from a larval stage into a mature adult insect;
- mature, grow up, come of age, to age from a child to an adult (or metaphorically to do so in terms of emotional maturity);
- to gain experience in a given field, to attain mastery of some skill

Etymology: originally only in the first sense, a verbal derivative from Old Boral pluot, pluvot "down feathers, (later) beard stubble". This is a diminutive (possibly via a Kelt form) of plum "feather", from the synonymous plūma in Latin.
