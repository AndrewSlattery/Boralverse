118.4: sounç "release"

sounç /sunts/ [suns]
- release, the act of letting something or someone go or of causing something or something to become unstuck or untangled;
- launch, the movement of a vessel from land or moorage into the water;
- outbreak, outburst, the sudden appearance of something such as illness or war;
- (vulgar) orgasm, climax, the peak of sexual pleasure

Etymology: nominal derivative from verb souvr "solve, let go, release, launch", from solvō "I loosen, untie"; or, directly from a Latin noun solventia "a loosening, an untying". In the last sense attested from as early as the eighteenth century in erotic literature; the term continues to be dispreferred in formal or technical contexts.
