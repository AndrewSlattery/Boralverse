27.2: coram “in person”

coram /koˈram/ [kʊˈʀam]
- face-to-face, in person, occurring with one's own presence and not via a representative or via long-distance communication;
- personal, intimate, sensitive, dealing with subjects about which one wishes to be private or discreet

Etymology: used as an adverb since the Middle Boral period, taken from Latin cōram "in person, in public" as used in court proceedings to designate certain acts which contravened laws by virtue of being by one's own hand. Used also more generally as an adjective since the eighteenth century.
