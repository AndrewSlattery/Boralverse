85.3: seucq historic "posterity"

seucq historic /sawk ˌhɪ.stoˈrɪk/ [sawk ˌhɪ.stʊˈʀɪk]
- posterity, legacy, the status of something from the perspective of future generations

Etymology: collocation first seen in legal use in the eighteenth century, originally referring to certain inherited effects. The adjective historic "historical" is a direct borrowing from Latin historicus, while the noun seucq "footpath, trail, tracks; legacy, progeny" is murkier. It descends from Borland Latin silqua, sēlqua "track (of an animal)", though to be of Kelt origin.
