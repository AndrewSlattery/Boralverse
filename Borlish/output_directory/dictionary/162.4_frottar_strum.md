162.4: frottar "strum"

frottar /frɔˈtar/ [fʀʊˈtɐː]
- rub, chafe, scour, scrub, scrap, to move one object over another with pressure and friction;
- tickle, to touch (a person) in a manner so as to cause laughter;
- strum, to draw the fingers or a plectrum over the strings of a musical instrument;
- pluck, pick, press, to sound the individual strings or keys of an instrument;
- play, to make sounds with a guitar/harp/keyboard instrument

Etymology: from Old Borlish, borrowed from (or possibly the source of) Old French frotter "rub, polish". This is in either case of uncertain origin, but is generally thought to reflect Latin participle frictus of fricō "I rub, chafe". Musical senses are attested from the Middle Borlish period.
