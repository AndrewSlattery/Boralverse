4.3: autoschedon "hand-to-hand combat"

autoschedon /ˌo.to.skeˈdɔn/
- sparring, hand-to-hand combat (also seen adjectivally), fighting done within reach rather than at range and especially when un- or unconventially armed;
- martial art, any of several fighting styles which contain systematic methods of training for combat and often practised as sport

Etymology: borrowed into Boral and other languages in the late eighteenth century during a fashion for Classical Greek emulation, including athletic practices; adapted from the adverb αὐτοσχεδόν "hand-to-hand", literally "near themselves".
