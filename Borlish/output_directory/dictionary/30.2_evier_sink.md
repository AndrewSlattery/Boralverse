30.2: evier "sink"

evier /eˈvjɛr/ [ɪˈvjɛː]
- sink, basin, a receptacle for holding water used to wash things;
- (more generally) any low area into which water flows

Etymology: practically unchanged from Old Boral, a borrowing from Old French evier, ewer "pitcher, jug, basin" which reflects Latin aquārium "object related to water". Compare the native descendant augher "ewer, jug".
