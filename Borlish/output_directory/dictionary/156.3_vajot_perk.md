156.3: vajot "perk"

vajot /vaˈʒɔt/ [vɐˈʝɔt]
- benefit, advantage, something in one's circumstances that is helpful;
- perk, bonus, any incidental benefit that one receives;
- (archaic) wage, profit, salary, money or other compensation received for work

Etymology: originally in the last senses, from a diminutive of Old Borlish uai "legal contract; salary, wage", from synonymous wadium in Medieval Latin (compare gage in Old French). This comes from Frankish wadi "stake, pledge", which is related to English "wedding". The word was displaced in its original sense by parsou "wage, rate; worth, value".
