77.4: orruðar "seem"

orruðar /ˌɔ.riˈðar/ [ˌɔ.ʀɪˈðɑː]
- amount to, be, to be the same as or equivalent to;
- seem, to give the impression of or to be thought of in a particular way;
- (impersonal, with dative experiencer) think, deem, reckon, to have an impression of something

Etymology: from Old Boral oruðar, ouruðar "to take up space, take the form of; to amount to", from Late Latin obrūtō "I overwhelm, conceal, cover, take up space". This is a regularisation (with unexplained lengthening of the root vowel) of synonymous obruō in Classical Latin, based on the past participle. In impersonal use it appears to be syntactically modelled on Germanic constructions like English methinks "it seems to me".
