176.4: gevrment "circuitry"

gevrment /ˌgɛvr̩ˈmɛnt/ [ˌgɛ.vɐˈmɛnt]
- wiring, circuitry, a system of electrical components and their connections within a particular device;
- nitty-gritty, nuts and bolts, the (possibly figurative) inner workings of any object or concept;
- minutiae, intricacies, the (often trivial) tiny or precise details of a situation

Etymology: derivation with the gestalt suffix -ment < Latin -mentum from the noun gevr "electrical wire". This is a borrowing via synomous guèvre in Parisian from Welsh guivr "wire". In turn this appears to have been borrowed from Old English wīr "metal thread", likely influenced in form by guevr "amber" due to the latter's electrical properties. In metaphorical use the term is seen from the mid-twentieth century.
