74.2: tascban "vanilla"

tascban /taxˈban/ [tɐxˈban]
- vanilla, a tropical climbing orchid whose pod fruit yield an extract used in food or perfumes;
- the fruit, bean, extract or flavouring derived from this plant;
- (metaphorically) all-rounder, jack of all trades, someone or something with versatile uses or talents

Etymology: seventeenth century, borrowed into Borlish (via Vascon taxbàn or French tacheban) from Morrove Arabic تشبان (tashbān) "vanilla plant, vanilla flavouring". This is an early sixteenth century borrowing from the Thebevan [Totonac] tałpán "vanilla plant" (possibly via Nawat [Nahuatl]).

In the metaphorical sense it is attested from the early twentieth century (originally in Hasinick Welsh but quickly spreading), due to the prevalence of vanilla flavouring throughout cuisine and perfumery.
