aposc "forth"

aposc /aˈpɔx/ [ɐˈpɔx]
- forth, forward, ahead, in the direction of increasing time or degree or out from a particular place;
- henceforth, going forward, in future, from now on, at all times after the present;
- onward, continually, going on without pause or hesitation;

Etymology: adverbial derivation from prepostion posc "after, since" < Late  Latin posque < post quem "after which". This word was originally  restricted to taking complements "after I get back" rather than nominal arguments "after the wedding", for which one would use now-obsolete pos < Latin post "after, behind"; the former had displaced the latter by  the fifteenth century.
