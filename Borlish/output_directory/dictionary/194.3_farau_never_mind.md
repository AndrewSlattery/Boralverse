194.3: farau "never mind"

farau /faˈro/ [fɐˈʀo]
- oh well, never mind, no big deal, no sweat, it's OK, an injunction not to worry about something;
- hang in there, c'est la vie, so it goes, a reassurance that things will turn out well despite a setback

Etymology: early Modern Borlish, a clipping of the phrase (still occasionally seen in full) tal farau nos "such is life", literally "so we fare". The verb farar "fare; exist (in a given state)" was borrowed in the Old Borlish period from Old English faran "go, travel; fare". The expression originally represented commiseration (a sense which it partially retains as a self-directed expletive); in its modern senses it is seen from the nineteenth century.
