166.2: fren "brake"

fren /frɛn/ [fʀɛn]
- bit, piece of metal placed in a horse's mouth and connected to the reins;
- brake, device used to slow or stop a vehicle usually via friction;
- deceleration, slowdown, reduction in speed;
- ritenuto, ritardando, (in music) reduction of tempo;
- restraint, reserve, tendency to act with caution or prudence

Etymology: originally in the first sense, via Old Borlish directly from Latin frēnum "bridle, harness, curb, bit". The word was extended metaphorically some centuries before it was reapplied to physical devices on other vehicles. In music the word is calqued from Willem Dutch afrem "slow down (imp.)", potentially also due to phonetic resemblance.
