163.3: cedar "guitar"

cedar /tseˈdar/ [tsɪˈdɐː]
- guitar, a fretted string instrument strummed or plucked with the fingers or a plectrum;
- zither, gittern, any of several similar such instruments in the lute family;
- (informal) skate, ray, any flat-bodied fish with wing-like fins and a whip-like tail

Etymology: Middle Borlish, borrowed from early Jean cedara "guitar", a descendant of Latin cithara "lyre, lute" which was repurposed to refer to a related instrument of Morrove descent imported via Spain. The term has been used in the last sense since the nineteenth century (cf earlier ray a cedar "guitar ray") in reference to the shape of these fish.
