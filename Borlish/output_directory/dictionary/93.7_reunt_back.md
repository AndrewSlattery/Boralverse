93.7: reunt "back"

reunt /rawnt/ [ʀawnt]
- back, to or in an earlier state or place;
- at odds, contrariwise, in a manner which contradicts something;
- once more, again, over, another time (especially when performing an action twice returns one literally or metaphorically to one's starting point)

Etymology: present participle of reuvr "come back, return, turn over, flip, do again, repeat". This descends via Old Borlish reouvre from Latin revolvō "I unroll, repeat", from volvō "I roll, tumble".
