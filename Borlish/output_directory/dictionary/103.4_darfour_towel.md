103.4: darfour "towel"

darfour /darˈfur/ [dɐːˈfʊː]
- towel, a cloth used for drying something wet;
- terrycloth, fabric woven with many protruding loops of thread which can absorb large amounts of water;
- (specifically) bath towel, cloth for drying one's body after bathing or showering;
- bathrobe, a garment made of terrycloth

Etymology: agentive derivation from darfar "dry out, cause to dry, desiccate", which reflects a presumed Vulgar Latin dēārefō "I dry out" related to Classical ārefaciō "I dry up, wither" < āreō "I am dry" (compare Portingale alfar "to be thirsty").
