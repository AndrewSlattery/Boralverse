201.6: Lexember 2025 - 27: ormal "set"

ormal /ɔrˈmal/ [ʊːˈmal]
- quiver, quiverful, a container for arrows (bolts, darts, etc) or the contents of such a container;
- (obsolete, vulgar) vagina, the sex organ connecting the vulva and the cervix;
- salvo, volley, an instance of concentrated fire from artillery;
- programme, set, the scheduled list of pieces of music that are to be played at a concert (or a similar timeline of discrete events)

Etymology: an Old Borlish borrowing from Old Norse ǫrmalr "quiver". This is a compound of ǫr "arrow" and malr "case"; the former is from Classical German arhuō "arrow", while the latter is likely allied with malhō "leather bag" (although the change of declension is unexplained). The vulgar sense was current in the Middle Borlish period and enjoyed a brief resurgence in the 19th century due to conscious use in historical novels. The musical senses are attested from the 1920s, originally in reference to recorded music played over the radio.
