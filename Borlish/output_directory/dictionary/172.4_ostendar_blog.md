172.4: ostendar "blog"

ostendar /ˌɔ.stɛnˈdar/ [ˌɔ.stɪnˈdɐː]
- exhibit, display, to show for public consumption;
- publish, to have (usually a work of writing) publicised via some outlet;
- blog, post, to write (or otherwise create content) and publish on the pistol mesh [Internet]

Etymology: early Modern Borlish, a borrowing (probably via a French or Italian language) from Latin ostendō "I expose to view, reveal". In journalism the term originally connoted commercial writing as opposed to actual news. In the context of the mesh there are attestations from the earliest meshfora in the late 1960s.
