171.2: vancar "loot"

vancar /vanˈkar/ [vɐŋˈkɐː]
- loot, pillage, plunder, snatch, to get possession of underhandedly;
- catch, secure, nail, nab, apprehend, seize, to get hold of and prevent from leaving one's grasp;
- win, to receive as a reward

Etymology: early Modern Borlish, verbal derivation from vanc "catch, haul; loot, plunder". This was borrowed from Willem Dutch verb vangen "to catch", a descendant (modelled after the preterite forms) from Classical German fanhō "I take, seize". In the last sense the word is attested from the early twentieth century.
