17.4: orbeutar "swindle"

orbeutar /ˌɔr.bawˈtar/ [ˌɔː.bɐwtɑː]
- cheat, swindle, defraud, con, to obtain money or other property from a person by means of deception;
- screw, undermine, hinder, to ruin someone's position in a game or other situation

Etymology: from Old Boral orbeutar "to sneak up on, surprise", formed by metathesis from synonymous Insular Latin *obrēptāre, a regularisation via conjugation shift from Classical obrēpere "to creep, swindle". In the sense "defraud", possibly a retention from the Classical word, although this meaning isn't attested in Boral until trial records of the seventeenth century.
