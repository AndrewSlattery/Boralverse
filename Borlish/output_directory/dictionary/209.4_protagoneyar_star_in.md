protagoneyar /proˌta.goˈnjar/ [pʀʊˌta.gʊˈnjɐː]
- star in, lead, to be or perform as the main character of (a piece of media);
- dominate, predominate, drive, to be the main factor or influence in (some process or condition);
- to be the main topic of conversation during (a period of time), often of people involved in viral events or scandal

Etymology: nineteenth century, verbal derivative based on the noun protagonist "lead actor, dominating factor". This is an early modern borrowing via Scholastic Latin from Greek πρωταγωνιστής • (prōtagōnistḗs) "lead actor". The word is attested in non-dramatic usage from the early twentieth century.
