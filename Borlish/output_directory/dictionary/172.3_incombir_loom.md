172.3: incombir "loom"

incombir /ˌɪn.kɔmˈbɪr/ [ˌɪŋ.kʊmˈbɪː]
- behove, befit, benefit, suit, to be proper or advantageous for someone to do;
- incite, impel, urge, provoke, to provide an impetus to do;
- press, overlay, to put pressure upon from above;
- loom, tower, to stand tall nearby (usually in a threatening manner)

Etymology: originally in the first senses, a Middle Borlish borrowing from Latin incumbō "I lie upon, I recline". The physical senses are attested later and may be based on the Latin (or may show influence from related descombr "go to bed, lie down to sleep).
