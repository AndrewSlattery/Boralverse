128.2: fardig "solo"

fardig /farˈdaj/ [fɐːˈdaj]

    solo, music played by a single performer;
    chance to shine, big moment, moment in the spotlight, an oppoortunity to be noticed to do demonstrate one's skill;
    moment of truth, critical point, a time when one's skills or resolve are finally tested (especially after a period of complacency or uncertainty)

Etymology: seventeenth century, originally in the musical sense. Borrowed from a continental language, likely Vascon fardig(a) or Portingale fardigo/a "solo, played alone". These come from a derivative of the Arabic root فَرْد · fard "alone, single, solitary". Extension to non-musical contexts is seen from the late nineteenth century.
