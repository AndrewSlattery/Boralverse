207.3: nougl "distaff"

nougl /nujl/ [nwɪl]
- distaff, a device storing natural fibres to be spun;
- spinneret, the organ with which a spider spins its web;
- spinning, fibrecraft, the art of making things like textiles or rope;
- (regional, poetic) cattail, teasel, mullein, foxtail, or various other herbs and reeds with distaff-shaped flower spikes or seedheads

Etymology: from late Old Borlish noȝl "distaff". This is though to conflate two earlier forms: (1) conoȝl "distaff" < synonymous conucula in Late Latin, dissimilatory derivative of Classical colus "distaff"; (2) rocle "distaff" < synonymous rokkill in Old Norse. Dialects differ greatly on which particular plants may be referred to by this term; its meaning is not clarified by its indiscriminate use in poetry.
