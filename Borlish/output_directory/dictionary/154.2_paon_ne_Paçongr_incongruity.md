154.2: paon ne Paçongr "incongruity"

paon ne Paçongr /paˈɔn ne paˈtsɔn.gr̩/ [ˈpaun ne pɐˈtsɔŋ.gɐ]
- something appearing in a unexpected or jarring context;
- incongruity, anomaly, aberration, a mismatch between expectation and reality

Etymology: idiom from the nineteenth century, literally meaning "a peacock on Paçongr (Place)". The noun paon "peacock" descends directly from synonymous pāvō in Latin. The placename Roðon Paçongr, a major intersection in Borland's capital city Damvath, is a borrowing from the Italian name Pazzongolo; this is presumed to reflect in part the uncommon diminutive -unculus in Latin, but the root is of unknown origin.
