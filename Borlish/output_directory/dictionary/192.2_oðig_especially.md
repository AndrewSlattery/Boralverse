192.2: oðig "especially"

oðig /oˈðaj/ [ʊˈðaj]
- (literary) especially, particularly, to a greater extent than is usual;
- to wit, i.e., viz., namely, that is, expressed in other words;
- or even, if not, moreover, but also, introducing an additional property or fact;
- (interjection) sure, just so, right, I see, expressing that something is (now) clear or a more general agreement

Etymology: descendant of Old Borlish oðiȝ "truly, certainly", which reflects Latin adverb utique "in any case, at least, in particular". The term in its adverbial use is now restricted to very formal writing, and the clarifying sense is also more of the written than spoken register.

The final two sets of senses are sometimes held to be an unrelated compound, comprising Old Borlish o, oð, ou, ouð "whether" and iȝ "there". These come from Latin aut "or" and ibi "there" respectively.
