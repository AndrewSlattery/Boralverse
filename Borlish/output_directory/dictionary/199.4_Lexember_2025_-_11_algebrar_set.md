algebrar /ˌal.ʒɛˈbrar/ [ˌal.ʝɪˈbʀɐː]
- set, reduce, to put (a broken or dislocated bone) back into an optimal position for healing;

Etymology: Middle Borlish, borrowed from Scholastic Latin algebrō "I set (a bone)" along with noun algebr < algebra "bone-setting; restitution". This occurs in medical texts from as early as the twelfth century translated from Arabic, a borrowing from الْجَبْر • al-jabr "restoration, compulsion". Financial use is attested from the seventeenth century; political from the late nineteenth (in the run-up to the Millstone War).
