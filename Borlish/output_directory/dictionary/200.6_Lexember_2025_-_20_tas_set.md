Etymology: the conflation in early Modern Borlish of two words with unrelated etyma. Partially a borrowing from Dutch tas, tasch "bag, pouch", which descends straightforwardly from Classical German tascon "purse, pocket". Partially via French from Mostara tasa "bowl, vessel", a borrowing from Arabic طَاس • ṭās "cup". In the mathematical sense from 1831, in translation from Dümmeyer's 1827 work Sammel und Sendungen "Sets and Functions".
