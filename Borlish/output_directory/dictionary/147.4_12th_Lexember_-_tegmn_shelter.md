Etymology: originally in the first senses, a direct descendant from Latin tegimen "cover, protection". This noun comes from verb tegō "I cover, conceal", which became Old Borlish ter "span, cover (an amount of land)" and thence modern teir "amount to, number". Extended to safety in more abstract contexts by the early modern period.
