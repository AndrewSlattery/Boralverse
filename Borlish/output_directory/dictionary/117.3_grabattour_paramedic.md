117.3: grabattour "paramedic"

grabattour /ˌgra.baˈtur/ [ˌgʀa.bɐˈtʊː]
- paramedic, EMT, a person trained to medically stabilise injured people on-site before they can be transported to a hospital;
- (historical, esp. Millstone War) stretcher-bearer, a soldier or auxiliary serviceman who carries the wounded away from the battlefield on stretchers

Etymology: 20C, agentive derivation from grabat "stretcher, gurney; emergency medical transport". This is a borrowing via another Romance language from Latin grabātus "cot, pallet, camp bed", from Greek. Transfer from the military context to peacetime healthcare is attested from the 1950s.
