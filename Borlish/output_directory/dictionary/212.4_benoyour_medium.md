212.4: benoyour "medium"

benoyour /ˌbe.nɔˈjur/ [ˌbe.nʊˈʝʊː]
- medium, spiritualist, a person who attempts communication with the dead;
- shaman, witch doctor, a member of a community representing or speaking for the spiritual realm and often also acting as a healer

Etymology: agentive derivation from now-obsolete benoïr "to receive blessings; (specifically) to receive communications from the deceased". This verb was formed in the early Middle Borlish period by analogy with bendigr "to bless" (itself obsolete by parallel beneïr, both from Latin benedīcō "I commend, praise; I bless") from the root oïr "to hear" < Latin audiō "I hear". The word enjoyed some use in lay Christian practice before dropping out of use in the Revitalist period of the early sixteenth century; it was revived in reference to non-Christian roles as well as to rites of the Novomundine "Prodigal Faiths" during the nineteenth century.
