112.2: imminent "prospective"

imminent /ˌɪ.miˈnɛnt/ [ˌɪ.mɪˈnɛnt]
- projecting, overhanging, suspended above;
- prospective, anticipated, likely or expected to happen;
- newly elected, (of a candidate) voted in but having not yet taken office;
- apparent, (of an heir) having a claim to a title that cannot be superseded by the birth of anyone else

Etymology: Middle Boral borrowing from Latin imminēns, present participle of immineō "I overhang; I am intent upon, I am near at hand". The verb imminir was briefly current but had obsolesced by the end of the seventeenth century. Its original use in Borlish was in the phrase heriter imminent "heir apparent", as opposed to heriter provisoir "heir presumptive".
