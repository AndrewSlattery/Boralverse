157.3: lox "pizza"

lox /lɔks/ [lɔks]
- pizza, tostada, manakish, lahmacun, lángos, tlayuda, uttapam, okonomiyaki, pajeon, any meal that comprises a thin bread or pancake base with various savoury toppings that is eaten in slices

Etymology: borrowed into Borlish in the twentieth century via for instance Saxon lox, Napolitan losse, Awrish [Hungarian] locs /lokʃ/ and Greek λώξη • lṓxē "pizza, etc." from a metathetic variant of Armeniac լաւշկի • lōški "lavash, pitta, small flatbread". The word is applied widely, although without modification it refers prototypically to slices of thin bread with a sauce, cheese and vegetables.
