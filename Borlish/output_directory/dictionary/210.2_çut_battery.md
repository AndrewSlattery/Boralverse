210.2: çut "battery"

çut /tsɪt/ [tsɪt]
- cell, battery, a device used to power electronic equipment which maintains a potential difference between two contacts;
- (by extension) any notional store of physical or mental energy;
- reserves, stockpile, assets set aside for contingencies;
- potential, capacity, a person's yet-untapped ability or resources

Etymology: eighteenth century, borrowed from Vascon çut "waterwheel, weir; electric battery"; the latter sense was clipped from earlier çut barric "electric weir", cells being seen as analogous stores of useful work. This in turn is a rebracketed form of original açut "waterwheel, dam", which is allied with Leon açud and Portingale açude; it was borrowed from Arabic السُّدّ • as-sudd "the dam, the dike".
