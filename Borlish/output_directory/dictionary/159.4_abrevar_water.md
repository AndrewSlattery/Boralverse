Etymology: from Old Borlish abrevar "to water", likely borrowed from Old French synonymous abrever in Old French. This is a metathetic variant of abevrer, which descends from Vulgar Latin abbiberō "I water" (which the Old Borlish may alternatively reflect directly), a derivative of Classical bibō "I drink". The word's association with alcohol and social gatherings shows influence from slang term abrevað "tipsy, squiffy, somewhat drunk", literally "watered".
