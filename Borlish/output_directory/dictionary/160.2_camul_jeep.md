160.2: camul "jeep"

camul /kaˈmɪl/ [kɐˈmɪl]
- jeep, off-roader, SUV, a small military-style vehicle suited to rough terrain;
- (attributive) rugged, weatherproofed, hardened, fortified, treated or designed so as to resist the elements

Etymology: mid-twentieth century, genericised from Drengot military jargon but of uncertain further origin. Possibly an alteration of camel "camel" in reference to transporting soldiers and materiel; perhaps based on Latin chamūlcus "a kind of chariot". The term has been used to describe other "battle-ready" gear (usually consumer goods like backpacks and drinks bottles) since the 1980s.
