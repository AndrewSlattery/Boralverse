112.3: sou teneur covart "in secret"

sou teneur covart /su teˈnawr koˈvart/ [su tɪˈna.wɐ kʊˈvɐːt]
- in the dark, under the cover of darkness, without any light;
- in secret, secretly, out of view, sub rosa, concealed from any eavesdroppers or spies

Etymology: idiom attested from the eighteenth century, literally "under covered darkness"; probably formed by analogy to preexisting sou ciel ovart "in plain view", literally "under open sky". The noun teneur is an uncomplicated descendant from Latin tenebrae "darkness"; the adjective covart is the past participle of covrir "to cover", from Latin cooperiō "I cover, overwhelm, clothe".
