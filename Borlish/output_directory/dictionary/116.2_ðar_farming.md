116.2: ðar "farming"

ðar /ðar/ [ðɐː]
- farming, farmwork, agriculture, tilth, the business and activity of cultivating land and raising livestock;
- (in certain idiomatic expressions, more generally) work, toil, labour, drudge, any particularly strenuous activity;
- (colloquially) sex, intercourse, the act of having sex with somebody

Etymology: Middle Borlish deverbal from ðarar "plough, till; farm; labour", originally restricted to crop production and not animal husbandry. This descends uncomplicatedly from Latin adarō "I plough, till". In the last sense it is attested since the early twentieth century but is thought to be much older; cf. Tuscan arare "to plough; to have sex with".

Whether or not the namers of the Minister a Ðar "Ministry for Agriculture" were aware of the slang usage, many caricaturists have since seized on the pun.
