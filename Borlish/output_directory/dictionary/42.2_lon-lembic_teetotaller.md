42.2: lon-lembic "teetotaller"

lon-lembic /ˌlɔn.lɛmˈbɪk/
- teetotaller, non-drinker, one who abstains from drinking any alcoholic beverages;
- alcohol-free drink, a beverage which has been altered so as not to contain any alcohol

Etymology: first attested 1902 as a univerbation of phrase lon lembic "without alcohol", probably adapted from slightly earlier French and Dutch compounds. The word lon "without" reflects Latin adverb longē "far away". The noun lembic "ethanol; (more broadly) alcoholic drink" descends from Scholastic Latin lembīcum "alembic, still; (later) distilled spirits", which is borrowed via Arabic from Greek ἄμβῑξ (ámbīx) "cup with a spout; alembic".
