175.4: yemal "cool"

yemal /jeˈmal/ [ʝɪˈmal]
- wintry, chilly, cold, pertaining to or reminiscent of winter;
- standoffish, cool, making no overtures of politeness or friendliness;
- stern, severe, strict, acting without flexibility or mercy

Etymology: Middle Borlish (h)iemal "wintry", borrowed from Latin hiemālis "pertaining to winter", from hiems "winter". The term lost its initial h- (unlike most contemporaneous Latin borrowings) due to contamination from native yarn "winter" < Latin hībernum "winter". Emotional extension of the term is seen shortly thereafter, in parallel to stival "summery, friendly".
