119.3: a squid "on the take"

a squid /a skwɪd/ [a skwɪd]
- on the take, corrupt, bought, bribed, accepting money from illicit sources in exchange for their influence;
- subverted, in the pocket (of), secretly under someone else's control

Etymology: 19C, analysable as a phrase meaning "at handshake", using the slang term squid "handshake; informal agreement, under-the-table deal". However, it is unclear whether the noun squid is a backformation, as the phrase may have been borrowed wholesale from contemporary Welsh á sguyd "with a (hand)shake", a derivative of verb squid "shake, toss, tremble".
