85.2: surplombar "overhang"

surplombar /ˌsɪr.plɔmˈbar/ [ˌsɪː.plʊmˈbɑː]
- overhang, hang over, impend, to be suspended above;
- overlook, to be located higher up than (as of a building on a hill);
- threaten, imperil, to place in a dangerous position;
- impinge upon, affect, interfere with, clash with, to have a (usually negative) impact on;
- to immediately precede in time

Etymology: Middle Boral coinage from sur- "over" (< Latin super-) and plomb "lead, weight, sound", conjuring the image of a weight suspended above something. In the third and fourth senses, from the inherent danger of the suspended object falling on one (attested from the sixteenth century); in the last sense originally in guild jargon and perhaps then jocular (attested from the early twentieth century).
