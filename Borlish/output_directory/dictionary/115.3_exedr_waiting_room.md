115.3: exedr "waiting room"

exedr /ɛkˈsɛ.dr̩/ [ɪgˈzɛ.dɐ]
- antechamber, anteroom, forecourt, vestibule, entrance hall, a room between the outside and the main interior of a building;
- (historical) exedra, a small room for discussion lined with benches;
- waiting room, lounge, a space inside a public for people to sit and wait (especially a particularly well-appointed or luxurious such space);

Etymology: an early modern borrowing from Latin exedra "discussion hall with seating", itself from Greek ἐξἕδρα "an exterior sitting place". In the last sense it is attested from the nineteenth century, originally in reference to such rooms in train stations.
