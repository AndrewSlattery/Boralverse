Etymology: past participle of se corrir "make it, survive, get through, succeed", the reflexive of corrir "run". This descends directly from Latin currō "I run". Idiomatic use of this phrase is seen from the fifteenth century poetry of Manuel Kigman. The phrase appears to have originally referred to simply being well-off or comfortable; semantic association with the verb has more recently given the idiom connotations of past struggle and present battle-readiness.
