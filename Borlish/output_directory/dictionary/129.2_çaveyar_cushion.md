129.2: çaveyar "cushion"

çaveyar /ˌtsa.viˈjar/ [ˌtsavˈjɐː]
- cushion, pad, to furnish with cushions or similar soft things;
- cushion, soften, to absorb or deaden the impact or weight of something;
- sugarcoat, sanitise, prettify, to make (something) more palatable or otherwise easier to accept

Etymology: seventeenth-century backformation from noun çaveyal "cushion, pillow", which descends via Old Borlish ça(r)veȝal "pillow" from synonymous cervīcal in Latin (the loss of /r/ is irregular but compare çavel "brain" < cerebellum). In the last sense the verb is especially seen in the phrase y los çaveyar "to sweeten the pill", literally "to cushion the slab".
