tars /tarz/ [tɑːz]
- clean, wiped, scrubbed, having been cleansed by some means;
- blank, unmarked, devoid of markings such as writing;
- (of a facial expression) blank, emotionless, neutral, not revealing anything of one's true thoughts;
- sheer, utter, downright, absolute, unmitgated, offering no exception or qualification

Etymology: past participle of targr "to clean, wipe, scrub", descendant of Latin tergō (variant of tergeō "I wipe, polish"). In the last sense first seen in certain collocations like victoir tars "a runaway victory".
