Etymology: literally "to have bull", idiom attested (in the slightly different sense of impulsiveness) from the sixteenth century. The noun taur was altered from early Middle Borlish tor to be closer to Latin taurus "bull, steer". The last sense is attested sporadically from the late nineteenth century and reached its peak popularity in the mid-twentieth.
