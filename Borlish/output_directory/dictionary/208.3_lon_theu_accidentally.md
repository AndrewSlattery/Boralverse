Etymology: phrase meaning "without will", attested from the Old Borlish period. The preposition lon "without, lacking" is thought to descend from Latin adverb longē "far away, for a long time". The noun theu "will, habit" was borrowed in the Old Borlish period from Old English þēaw "wont, behaviour". Extension to happenstances and mistakes is seen from the early modern period.
