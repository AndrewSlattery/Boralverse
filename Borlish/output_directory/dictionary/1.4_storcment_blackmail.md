1.4: storcment "blackmail"

storcment /stɔrkˈmɛnt/ [stʊːkˈmɛnt]
- blackmail, extortion, making someone give you money or other property by means of threats;
- a piece of blackmail material, something incriminating with which one might extort money from someone

Etymology: nominal derivation first attested in legal proceedings of the Middle Boral period from verb storcr "to extort, blackmail". The verb may be borrowed from Norman estorquer or may be native; either way it descends (or is an early reborrowing) from Latin extorqueō "I extort, tear away, wrench out".
