132.4: sce "wheelhouse"

sce /xe/ [çe]
- (historical) cathedral, the principal church of an (arch)diocese containing the episcopal throne;
- (historical, specifically) papal see, Holy See, the jurisdiction of a pope;
- venue, arena, stadium, theatre, the building in which an event happens;
- place, venue, setting, the place where anything happens;
- field, domain, the study of something in particular;
- (in the expression ne sce de) wheelhouse, bailiwick, domain, a person's area of authority or expertise

Etymology: originally in the first senses, descending via Old Borlish sce, sie "see, (arch)diocese" from Latin sedes "seat; residence; (Late Latin) episcopal see". Broadening to more general locations occurred in tandem with the import of cathedral to replace most of the religious senses. The idiom ne sce de "in the wheelhouse of" is attested from the 19th century.
