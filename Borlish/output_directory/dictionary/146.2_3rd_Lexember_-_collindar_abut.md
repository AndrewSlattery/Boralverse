146.2: 3rd Lexember - collindar "abut"

collindar /ˌkɔ.lɪnˈdar/ [ˌkɔ.lɪnˈdɐː]
- abut, neighbour, border, to lie adjacent to (as of a piece of territory);
- run up against, bump into, to start encountering problems with;
- resemble, recall, to remind one of due to similarity

Etymology: regular descendant of Latin collimitō "I border on", from limitō "I delimit, bound". Alternatively, a derivation in the Old Borlish period from an unattested lindar or now-dialectal lint "fence". Extension to conceptual closeness is attested from the seventeenth century.
