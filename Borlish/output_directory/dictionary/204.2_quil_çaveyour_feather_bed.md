Etymology: phrase attested from the early modern period, literally "cushioner bed". This is an early example of a compound-forming construction, much more prevalent in the modern language, which uses agent nouns as modifiers. The noun quil "bed" descends directly via Old Borlish quil, coil "bed, cot" from Latin cubīle "bed, couch; lair, kennel"; the verb çaveyar "cushion, soften; sugarcoat, sanitise" is a derivative of çaveyal "pillow", descending from synonymous cervīcal in Latin. Use as a mascot for easy living is seen from the nineteenth century, and has persisted likely due to its use in some evergreen folk songs.
