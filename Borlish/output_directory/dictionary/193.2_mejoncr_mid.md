193.2: mejoncr "mid"

mejoncr /meˈʒɔnk.r̩/ [mɪˈjɔŋ.kɐ]
- mid, mediocre, middling, average, OK, decent, of only moderate quality (usually disappointingly so);
- indifferent, lukewarm, unenthusiastic, not showing much excitement or optimism;
- unremarkable, forgettable, failing to make a strong impression;
- safe, cautious, risk-averse, avoiding extremes or deviation (of choices or behaviour);
- ambivalent, mixed, neither clearly good nor bad

Etymology: alteration of Middle Borlish mejocr "middling" under the influence of unrelated words like coroncr "impostor" and pujoncr "dagger" (whose endings descend from the diminutive suffix -(un)culus in Latin). This was borrowed directly from Latin mediocris "mediocre", a possible compound of medius "middle" and ocris "rugged mountain" (as to suggest "halfway up").
