44.2: jou follant "on the fence"

jou follant /ʒu fɔˈlant/ [ʝu fʊˈlan(t)]
- on the fence, undecided, weighing pros and cons, not having chosen between one of many (especially two) options;
- between a rock and a hard place, facing a dilemma, being in a difficult situation with no obviously good options

Etymology: idiom first attested in the seventeenth century, literally meaning "walking on a balance beam", with the image of an acrobat balancing on a seesaw. The noun jou "yoke, carrying pole, balance beam, seesaw" descends directly from Latin iugum with the same meaning, while the verb follar "to walk along, to tread" reflects Old Boral follar "to stamp, crush, tread on", from a Latin noun via Late Latin fullō "I trample, I full (cloth)".
