48.2: flottisc "fleet"

flottisc /flɔˈtɪx/ [flʊˈtɪç]
- fleet, flotilla, convoy, a group of ships or occasionally of other vehicles;
- (by extension) navy, the collective naval force of a country;
- backup, reinforcements, relief force, additional troops or equipment sent to support a military action (also in metaphorical use)

Etymology: originally in the first sense only in Old Boral flotisc, deverbal noun from verb flotir "to float, to be still in the water", itself a borrowing likely from Old English flotian "to float".
