128.3: lau pre yonoscon "in the middle of nowhere"

lau pre yonoscon /lo pre ˌjo.nɔˈxɔn/ [lo pʀe ˌʝo.nʊˈxɔn]

    in the middle of nowhere, isolated, a long way from anywhere of interest like settlements or amenities;
    stuck, lost, making no progress on a problem

Etymology: early nineteenth century idiom literally meaning "leagues before wherever". The noun lau "league" comes via Old Borlish from Insular Latin lauga "league" (cf. leuga, legua), originally a Gaulish unit. The pronoun yonoscon "wherever, anywhere" is an extension of yon "where" < Latin ubicumque "wherever" by analogy to words like calscon "whichever" < Latin quāliscumque "of whatever quality". In metaphorical use from the early twentieth century.
