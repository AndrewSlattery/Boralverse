182.2: broðoquin "gibberish"

broðoquin /ˌbro.ðoˈkwɪn/ [ˌbʀo.ðʊˈkwɪn]
- gibberish, gobbledegook, nonsense, babble, double Dutch, speech without meaning;
- bullshit, tosh, balderdash, poppycock, blatant falsehoods

Etymology: fourteenth century with various spellings, originally meaning "the language of non-Borlish speakers on Borland, especially of the northern Norse speakers". Both Norse and English languages had been spoken for several centuries on the north and west of the island, respectively. The word is presumed to be an adaptation of the Borland Norse phrase broð oc vin "bread and wine" (the alternative broðr oc ven "brother and friend" is considered less plausible).
