84.4: jagat "setting"

jagat /ʒaˈgat/ [ʝɐˈgat]
- setting, world, context, scenario, the time and place in which a narrative takes place;
- continuity, world, universe, a setting shared by a collection of fictional works;
- (poetic) universe, cosmos, Creation, the totality of all things in reality

Etymology: nineteenth century borrowing via Vascon from Gurjat જગત <jagat> "world, universe", used as a term of art for "setting" in literary criticism. This is a learned reflex of synonymous Sanscrit जगत् <jagat>, from a root cognate with English "come". Its poetic usage recalls the original sense but is not used in ordinary speech or writing.
