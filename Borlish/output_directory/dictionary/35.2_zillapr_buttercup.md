35.2: zillapr "buttercup"

zillapr /ziˈlapr̩/ [zɪˈla.pɐ]
- buttercup, crowfoot, any herbaceous plant of the genus Ranunculus which are characterised by having small yellow flowers;

Etymology: from early Middle Boral zilapre "buttercup", presumably from synonymous archaic Portingale (a)zialaparo, literally "bunny's boot". The word azia, laziga et al. "boot" is borrowed from Arabic أَحْذِيَة‎ • (ʾaḥḏiya) "leather boots", while the word laparo "young rabbit" is of obscure, perhaps pre-Roman Iberian, origin (compare borrowed Boral laprot "rabbit").
