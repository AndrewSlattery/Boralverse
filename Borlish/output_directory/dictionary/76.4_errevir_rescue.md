76.4: errevir "rescue"

errevir /ˌɛ.reˈvɪr/ [ˌɛ.ʀɪˈvɪː]
- rescue, save, deliver, to remove from any form of danger or violence;
- recover, salvage, extricate, to regain something from a prior undesirable location or state;
- (slang) steal, to get into one's own possession by underhanded means;
- to have (something) turn out surprisingly well, especially in the face of difficult conditions

Etymology: from Old Boral erevre, ereveir, from Latin ēripiō "I rescue, save, deliver, set free". Some forms show a conjugation shift from Classical ēripere to *ēripēre (compare cavir < *capēre < capere). Cognate with Barcelon erebre "to protect, guard".
