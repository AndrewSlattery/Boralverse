79.4: cay seg a veðerrem "elephant in the room"

cay seg a veðerrem /ke sij a veˈðɛ.rɛm/ [ke sij a vɪˈðɛ.ʀɐm]
- (int.)  tactful acknowledgement of a lie or secret everyone knows about but nobody will call out;
- (n., usually hyphenated) elephant in the room, such a lie or secret

Etymology: idiom first attested in this form in the late eighteenth century but having many variants beforehand; literally "it takes six (months) for the eldest (child)". This refers to a couple's first child being born only six months after the wedding, a situation where it is clear to everyone what happened but to mention it explicitly would be impolite.
