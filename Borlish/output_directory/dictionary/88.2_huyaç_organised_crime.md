88.2: huyaç "organised crime"

huyaç /haˈjats/ [hɐˈʝas]
- organised crime, mob activity, groups carrying out illegal acts seen as a collective, or the illegal acts themselves;
- corruption, unethical administrative or executive practices in government or business

Etymology: nineteenth-century coinage originating in Pentrose slang, a derivative of local dialect term huy "gang, mob, syndicate" with the pejorative suffix -aç < Latin -āceus "resembling". The noun huy goes back to the fifteenth century, and is a borrowing from Kernish chui "crowd, rabble" (cf. Cambrick why "movement").
