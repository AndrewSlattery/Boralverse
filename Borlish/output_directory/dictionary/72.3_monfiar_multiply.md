72.3: monfiar "multiply"

monfiar /mɔnˈfjar/ [mʊɱˈfjɑː]
- multiply, proliferate, to cause to increase in number;
- grow, increase, to make more significant or more developed;
- duplicate, copy, replicate, to create a copy or copies of

Etymology: from Old Boral moutfiȝar, montfiȝar "to multiply, increase in number; breed, procreate", reflecting a presumed Vulgar Latin *multificō "I multiply" (see Andalus muchiguar "to augment, grow, extend" from the same source). This is a variant of the synonymous multiplicō in Classical Latin.

Forms with <n> are either scribal error, simple liquid l>n dissimilation, or influenced by the unrelated verb montar "to rise, go up, increase".
