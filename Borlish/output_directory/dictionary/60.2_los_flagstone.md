60.2: los "flagstone"

los /lɔz/ [lɔz]
- flag, flagstone, slab, paving stone, a flat rectangular piece of rock or stone used for paving or roofing;
- stepping stone, a stone that can be stepped on in crossing an obstacle like a stream or marsh;
- building block, component, a single part used to build a larger construction or system;
- (stair) landing, the flat area at the top of a flight of stairs;
- platform, dais, podium, a raised area on which to stand;
- pavement, sidewalk, the (often paved) areas at the side of a road where people can walk;
- (figuratively) foundation, basis, building block, stepping stone, a means of advancing from one's current position

Etymology: originally in the first sense and descending from Old Boral los "flag, slab", reflected by synonymous lausa in Medieval Latin (and later Vascon llosa "slate", among others). This is thought to be from a Kelt form *lausā related to known līvus, whence for example Irish lie "stone, pillar".
