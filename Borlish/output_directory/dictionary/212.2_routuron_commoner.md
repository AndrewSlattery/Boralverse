212.2: routuron "commoner"

routuron /ˌru.tiˈrɔn/ [ˌʀu.tɪˈʀɔn]
- commoner, plebeian, proletarian, a citizen who holds no noble title or rank;
- (with plural agreement) hoi polloi, masses, rank and file, people considered as opposed to the elite

Etymology: Middle Borlish derivative of routur "vulgarity, working-class quality" (compare late Medieval Latin ruptūrō "freeman"), which originally referred to a small quantity of land as might be granted to or owned by a common farming household. This descends from Latin ruptūra "fracture, rupture, breach; (later) a division of land". Outside of historical texts, the term is usually metaphorical or jocular.
