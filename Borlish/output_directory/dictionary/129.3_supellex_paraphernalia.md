129.3: supellex "paraphernalia"

supellex /ˌsi.pɛˈlɛks/ [ˌsi.pɪˈlɛks]
- paraphernia, miscellanea, stuff, assorted items and especially the things that accrue over time in the course of some pastime or occupation;
- apparatus, kit, equipment, tools of the trade, the set of items one needs to do some activity;
- habits, wont, things that one does as a matter of course (often in a negative sense);

Etymology: 17C borrowing from Latin supellēx "furniture, utensils, kit", likely related to legō "I collect, gather". Extension to behaviours is seen from the late nineteenth century.
