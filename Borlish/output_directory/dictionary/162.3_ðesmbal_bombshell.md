Etymology: verb-noun compound formed in the twentieth century by analogy to earlier analogous words like caugtrbal "football", lit. "kick-ball". The noun bal "ball" comes from a variety of Germanic sources and potentially via Medieval Latin—cf. Old English beall, Old Norse bòllr, Frankish bal "ball". The verb ðesmar "aim, target, direct" reflects Old Borlish ðestmar "work out, consider, turn one's attention to", which descends from an extension of Classical Latin æstimō "I determine the worth of, I value"; thus, ðesmar is a doublet of semi-learned stimar "consider, deem". The word has been used metaphorically for unexpected things since the 1990s.
