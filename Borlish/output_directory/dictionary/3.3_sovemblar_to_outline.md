Etymology: from Middle Boral sowemblar "to imitate, copy (especially badly)", originally from Latin subæmulor "I emulate secretly". Whether the word is a later reborrowing or descends through Old Boral is unclear, as is whether the prefix sou- "under" is retained or a later addition. The use in the context of drawing starts to predominate from the eighteenth century onward, possibly influenced by phonetic similarity to emblem "logo, symbol" < Latin emblēma "mosaic, emblem".
