142.3: ec ogl quïr "close one's eyes"

ec ogl quïr /ɛk ɔil kwaiˈɪr/ [ɪˈgɔil kwɐˈʝɪː]
- close one's eyes, to cover one's eyes with one's eyelids so that one cannot see;
- ignore, turn a blind eye, to intentionally fail to recognise that something (usually bad) is happening

Etymology: fixed idiom literally meaning "to extinguish eyes". Both this and its opposite ec ogl accendr "open one's eyes, lit. light eyes" first appear in the early Middle Borlish period, presumably via the notion of making things light and dark. In metaphorical use the phrase is seen from the fifteenth century.

The noun ogl "eye" descends unproblematically from Latin oculus "eye"; the verb quïr "extinguish, darken; turn off, switch off" comes from Latin quiēscō "quieten, stop" after analogy to other inchoative verbs like finir < fīniō~fīniēscō "to finish".
