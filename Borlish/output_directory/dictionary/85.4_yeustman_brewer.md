yeustman /jawstˈman/ [ʝɐwsˈman]
- brewer, someone whose occupation is to prepare alcoholic beverages like beer
- inciter, firebrand, rabble-rouser, someone who instigates unrest or other trouble

Etymology: from Old Boral ȝeost manc/ç "beer seller", from the stem of ȝeostar "to ferment, brew" (modern yeustar), a borrowing from synonymous geostan in Borland English (cf. modern Merch yeast), and the element manc/ç "seller, vendor", either reflecting Insular Latin mantia "shop, household, inn" or Latin mangō "dealer, seller (of slaves)". In metaphorical use from the seventeenth century.
