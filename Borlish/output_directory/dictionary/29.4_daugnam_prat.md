29.4: daugnam "prat"

daugnam /dogˈnam/
- prat, ninny, a silly or foolish person;
- dupe, patsy, a person who has been or is likely to be deceived by a con artist;
- (dated) tosser, jerk, an objectionable or obnoxious person

Etymology: borrowed in the late nineteenth century from Markland English daugnam /ˈdəwg.nəm/ "contemptible man, idiot"; the word's etymology often mistakenly linked to Sarzan Dawkinholm (whose surname was pronounced the same), long-serving and much-lambasted Outland Minister in Markland at the time.

In fact, the surname and the word both descend from variously-spelt epithets for illegimate offspring in the royal houses of medieval Albion. These are Anglicisations of the Norman daucun houme "from nobody"—compare modern Boral alcun hom /ˌa.gɪˈnɔm/ "nobody".
