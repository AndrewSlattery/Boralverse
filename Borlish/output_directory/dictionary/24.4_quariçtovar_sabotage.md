24.4: quariçtovar "sabotage"

quariçtovar /kwaˌrɪts.toˈvar/ [kwɐˌʀɪs.tʊˈvɑː]
- to sabotage, to deliberately damage or destroy something in order to prevent its successful operation;
- to subvert, counteract, undermine, to oppose and mitigate the effects of something by taking action to the contrary

Etymology: nineteenth-century borrowing from Italian, either via the noun quarizzitovo or directly as the verb quarizzitovare (more likely; the stress of Boral quariçtou "sabotage, disruption" suggests it is an in-language deverbal derivation). This comes from Zahid Russian quaritstvo "intentional damage" via its use in military contexts during the Second German War.
