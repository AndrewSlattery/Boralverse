208.4: foyer figr "settle down"

foyer figr /fɔˈjɛr ˈfaj.r̩/ [fʊˈʝɛː ˈfa.jɐ]
- put down roots, settle down, to establish a long-lasting home in a particular community (especially via marriage and children);
- take root, take hold, to become established in some form

Etymology: idiom from the early modern period, literally "to set (a) hearth down". The noun foyer "hearth, fireplace; (fig.) homestead" is a direct descendant of Vulgar Latin focārium "hearth", an extension of synonymous focus in Classical Latin. The verb figr "put down, lay, place" reflects Latin fīgō "I fasten, fix".
