180.2: ensign "suit"

ensign /ɛnˈsain/ [ɪnˈsain]
- emblem, logo, symbol, insignia, a distinguishing mark or design;
- token, badge, a physical object decorated with such a mark;
- designation, role, rank, honour, position, office, entitlement to privileges and responsibility for duties in some sort of hierarchy;
- (cards) suit, each of the sets of playing cards distinguished by a particular small symbol

Etymology: Middle Borlish, a semilearned borrowing from Latin insignia "emblem, badge", a noun formation from adjective insignis "marked, distinguished". The word has been used metonymically to refer to the position conferred or represented by an insignia since the fifteenth century, and it has been used in card games from approximately the same time.
