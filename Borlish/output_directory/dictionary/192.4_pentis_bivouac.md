192.4: pentis "bivouac"

pentis /pɛnˈtɪz/ [pɪnˈtɪz]
- hut, shed, outbuilding, a small structure built as storage or shelter;
- annex, extension, a further interior section added to a building;
- lean-to, an attachment onto the outside of a building;
- bivouac, an improvised overnight shelter

Etymology: Middle Borlish, borrowed from contemporary French apentis "appendage, attached building". This reflects appendicium, a Medieval Latin variant of Classical appendix "supplement, addition". In the last sense it was originally restricted to military encampments.
