hey /hi/
- fence, a thin artificial barrier that separates two pieces of land often used to keep animals to one area;

also hey pondr /hi ˈpɔn.dr̩/

Etymology: noun from Old Boral hei, hey /hej/ "hedge, fence" (the extended senses are in use by the Middle Boral period), which is a borrowing from synonymous Old English heȝe—possibly influenced by Medieval Latin haga "hedge" which comes via Frankish.
