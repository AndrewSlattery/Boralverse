194.2: ou "whether"

ou /u/ [u]
- a particle forming polar questions placed directly after the constituent being interrogated;
- whether, if, whether or not, introducing clauses that are in doubt;
- either, introducing the first of two or more options

Etymology: Old Borlish o ou, "or; question particle", a direct descendant of Latin aut "or". In the last sense, the term was originally used for all the options in a list, but in the modern language the latter options are introduced by ben "or" < Latin bene "well". In the second sense it alternates with ig "that" < Latin ibi "there", which introduced realis clauses; the prototype examples are jo saif ig X "I know that X", jo saif noc ou X "I don't know whether X".

This word is unrelated to homographic ou "egg" < ōvum in Latin.
