194.4: skighar "refrain from"

skighar /skaˈjar/ [skɐˈʝɐː]
- avoid, abstain from, to not interact with in some way (as of food, vice, etc);
- eschew, shun, ostracise, exclude, to refuse to associate with (a person or idea) due to fear or moral rectitude;
- refrain from, not do, to stop oneself from performing some action (especially in the infinitive)

Etymology: Old Borlish iskiȝar "to flee, escape"; compare synonymous eschiver in Old French and sċīen "fear, recoil, startle" in Old English, all descending from Classical German sciuhas "frightened, timid, shy". The last senses are now by far the most common, originally a colloquial alternative for prohibitive constructions but now ubiquitous.
