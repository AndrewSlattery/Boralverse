197.2: aðm "treasure"

aðm /ˈað.m̩/ [ˈa.ðɐm]
- treasure, jewel, gem, something extremely valuable;
- darling, dear, sweetheart, a term of endearment for someone one loves;
- lover, mistress, cicisbeo, paramour, beau, an (illicit, unofficial or at least sub-marital) sexual or romantic partner;
- (media) MacGuffin, an object the pursuit of which drives the plot but whose precise identity and qualities are unspecified or irrelevant

Etymology: from Old Borlish aðm "concubine, paramour; (poss.) treasure" (the object sense is contemporaneously unattested, but later use suggests a retention), alteration of presumed *maðm via rebracketing with Old Borlish m(e) "my". It was borrowed from Old English māþm "precious object, jewel". Until the advent of the last sense in the twentieth century, the word had usually been restricted to possessive constructions.
