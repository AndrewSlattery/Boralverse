211.2: a tug "for fun"

a tug /a taj/ [a taj]
- for fun, for the love of the game, done for one's own enjoyment or other intrinsic desire to do so;
- friendly, penny-ante, (of a game) without serious stakes;
- voluntarily, intentionally, by one's own free will;
- (conjunction) so that, in order to, with a desire to bring about (some result)

Etymology: Middle Borlish idiom, literally "to passion". The noun tug "passion, fervour, enthusiasm" descends from Old Borlish tuȝ "inclination, impulse, drive". This was borrowed from Old English tyge "a pull, a draw", which is related to the verb tēon "pull, drag, lead". As a conjunction (attested from the sixteenth century) the construction requires someone's explicit agency in a way which the near-synonyms por and a fin do not.
