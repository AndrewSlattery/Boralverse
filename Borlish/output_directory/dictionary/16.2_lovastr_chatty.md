16.2: lovastr "chatty"

lovastr /loˈvastr̩/ [lʊˈvas.tɐ]
- sociable, outgoing, extroverted, inclined to companionship with others;
- chatty, gossipy, prone to friendly informal conversation;
- nosy, prying, snoopy, offensively curious or inquisitive

Etymology: from Old Boral lo(ȝ)vaçtre "talkative, forthcoming" (also loȝvastre following the syncretism of Latinate adverbial ending -aciter with pejorative -aster), from Latin loquāciter "in a talkative manner". Deletion of yogh in the first syllable is seen also in sevir "to follow" < Vulgar Latin sequīre; the behaviour of medial -qu- is somewhat inconsistent and may by conditioned by the surrounding vowels. Development of the more negative senses of the word occurs in the early Modern Boral period.
