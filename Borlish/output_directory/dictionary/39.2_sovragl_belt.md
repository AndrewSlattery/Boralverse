39.2: sovragl "belt"

sovragl /soˈvrɛjl/ [sʊˈvʀɛjʊ]
- belt, girdle, a band worn around the waist to hold clothing (usually pants) to one's body;
- sash, cummerbund, a decorative band of cloth worn across the body;

Etymology: direct descendant from Latin subligāculum "loincloth, kilt" exhibiting l-r dissimilation (attested from as early as c8 in Old Boral sovreiaȝle "waistband, overskirt") likely reinforced by the etymologically-unrelated prefix sovr- "over, above". Synchronically analysable as sovrar "pass, go over" + -agl, an unproductive nominal suffix producing words for tools or other instruments.
