72.2: ombisc "resignation"

ombisc /ɔmˈbɪx/ [ʊmˈbɪç]
- resignation, stepping down, retirement, the act of leaving a job or other duty

→ ombisc souvr /ɔmˈbɪx ˈsu.vr̩/ [ʊmˈbɪç ˈsu.vɐ]
- resign, step down, retire, to leave a job

Etymology: From Middle Boral ombisc "surrender, capitulation, giving up; resignation, act of leaving a post", deverbal from now-obsolete ombijar "surrender, capitulate, give up; resign, leave a post". This descends with a change of valency from Old Boral onbiȝar "subdue, quash, overcome, bring under control", itself borrowed from local Old English onbiegan "bend, subdue".

The verb phrase translates literally as "to release resignation, to let go of resignation". Compare var souvr "declare war" and ley souvr "uphold the law".
