139.2: truc "shove"

truc /trɪk/ [tʀɪk]
- shove, thump, jab, jostle, tackle, thrust, a forceful push without gentleness;
- try, go, stab, an (especially unpractised or clumsy) attempt at doing something

Etymology: Old Borlish deverbal from truccar "shove, jostle" (now archaic, superseded by truc fair), which reflects a Vulgar Latin extension trūdicō of Classical trūdō "I shove, thrust". In the latter senses it is attested from the nineteenth century.
