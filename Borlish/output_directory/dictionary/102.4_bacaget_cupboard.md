bacaget /ˌba.kaˈʒɛt/ [ˌba.kɐˈʝɛt]
- cupboard, cabinet, a piece of furniture with shelves for storing cookware or food;
- closet, wardrobe, a similar piece of furniture for storing clothes

Etymology: Middle Borlish, from contemporary French metathetic variants bacaget, cabbagès "cupboard; lean-to, cabin, hut". The first part of this word is related to cabbas "basket; storeroom" < Latin capāx "spacious", while the second may reflect ajouster "to add" (in dialect form agestir) or jeter "to throw".
