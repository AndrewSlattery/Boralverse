javigar "trawl"

javigar /ˌʒa.viˈgar/ [ˌʝa.vɪˈgɑː]
- trawl, to fish from a slow-moving vessel using a trawlnet;
- (by extension) sweep, scour, ransack, comb through, to make an exhaustive and methodical search over a defined area or down an explicit list of options;
- search, query, index, locate, to perform a search of a information organisation system (e.g. in a library) or, later, of a database or of webpages using a computer

Etymology: originally in the first sense, borrowed along with the noun javig "trawlnet; later, (a) methodical search" from synonymous Portingale xaviga in the thirteenth century; the initial voicing is unexplained and has been attributed to dialect variation. The Portingale word is a borrowing from Arabic شَبَكَة (shabaca) "fishing net", likely via Mostara Spanish.
