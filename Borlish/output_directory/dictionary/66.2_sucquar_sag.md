66.2: sucquar "sag"

sucquar /sɔˈkwar/ [sʊˈkwɑː]
- sag, droop, slump, to sink in the middle under the force of gravity;
- flag, tire, to begin to show signs of exhaustion;
- have enough, run out of patience, to no longer have the energy to deal with some nuisance

Etymology: from Old Boral sucquar "to sink, sag, slump", from synonymous søcqua in Old Norse. Seen in the last use especially in the phrase jo sucq den "I've had enough" from the sixteenth century. The latter meanings may have been influenced by Dane sʉg "ill, weary, fed up" or a similar cognate.

Jo sucq de ty connardaç!
