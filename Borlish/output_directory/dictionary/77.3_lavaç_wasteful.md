77.3: lavaç "wasteful"

lavaç /laˈvats/ [lɐˈvas]
- wasteful, prodigal, thriftless, lavish, not being economical with one's resources;
- extra, superfluous, gratuitous, redundant, spare, unnecessary, surplus to requirements

Etymology: Middle Boral borrowing from early Roun French lavace "wasteful, spare", originally "abundant, copious". This comes from a homonymous noun meaning "abundance" (originally "torrential rain"), a derivation from verb laver "to wash", from Latin lavō "I wash, bathe".
