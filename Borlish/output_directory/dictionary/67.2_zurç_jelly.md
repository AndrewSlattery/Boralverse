67.2: zurç "jelly"

zurç /zɪrts/ [zɪːs]

- jelly, a dessert made by boiling gelatin with sugar and fruit;
- aspic, a savoury dish of the same texture often made from meat stock;
- (more generally) gel, any substance having the same consistency as jelly

Etymology: early eighteenth century borrowing from French zurce "jelly, aspic", itself from sürze in Bavarn. This derives from a Classical German root sultiō "brine", related to English "salt". The word displaces now-obsolete veros "aspic" (apparently from veðr os "bone glass") in line with the substance's increasing use in sweet dishes.
