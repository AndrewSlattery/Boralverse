13.4: jolleistr "jaunt"

jolleistr /ʒoˈlistr̩/ [ʒʊˈli.stɐ]
- excursion, jaunt, outing, night out, a recreational trip especially lasting the evening and into the night;
- (obsolete) the Revillon, the evening meal eaten the night before Christmas usually in a public hall

Etymology: from Middle Boral jolveisr "Revillon", itself from Old Boral iolveisle with the same sense. Possibly influenced in form by Old French jolif "merry, joyful" (which may have been borrowed into southwestern dialects of Middle Boral; attestations are alleged but uncertain). The source of the Old Boral is in Norse jólveizla "Yule feast", a transparent compound (cf. modern Horther veizel "banquet").
