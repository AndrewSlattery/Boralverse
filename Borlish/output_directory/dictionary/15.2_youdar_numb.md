15.2: youdar "numb"

youdar /juˈdar/ [ʝʊˈdɑː]
- to numb, deaden, to cause a sensation (physical or emotional) to become less intense;
- to dull, blunt, to lessen the sharpness of an edge;
- to mitigate, palliate, extenuate, to lessen the harmful or otherwise negative impact of something

Etymology: from Middle Boral youdar, itself from Old Boral ievdar "to blunt, dull (an edge)" with unexplained vowel shift (possibly a result of interdialect borrowing) from /əw/ to /ow~u/ completed in the standard language by the thirteenth century. The Old Boral descends from synonymous Latin hebetō "I blunt", from adjective hebes "dull, blunt".
