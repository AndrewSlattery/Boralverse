41.4: soçavau "aside"

soçavau /ˌso.tsaˈvo/ [ˌso.tsɐˈvo]
- aside, sidenote, comment, remark, an incidental statement made quietly or in such a way that most people cannot hear it;
- (theatre, film) nondiegetic dialogue, dialogue said by characters or a narrator directly to the audience, so that the (other) characters cannot hear it;
- afterthought, a post-hoc idea or comment that only occurs after the time when it might have been a useful contribution

Etymology: eighteenth-century borrowing from Vascon soza-vau "aside, commentary, lit. under-voice", originally in the context of theatrical performance. The preposition soza "under, beneath" descends from Latin adverb subta, with influence from the form soz < subtus; the noun vau "voice" is an alteration of earlier vou, from the synonymous Latin vōcem.
