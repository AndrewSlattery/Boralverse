Etymology: phrase comprising or "well, however" and bon "good, correct". The particle or (now archaic in isolation) descends from Old Borlish or "now", either straight from Latin (hāc) hōrā "in (this) hour" or via synonymous (a)ore in Old French. The adjective bon comes directly from Latin bonus "good, right".
