noncupað /ˌnɔn.kiˈpaθ/ [ˌnɔŋ.kɪˈpah]
- so-called, nominal, commonly referred to by said name;
- self-styled, self-proclaimed, soi-disant, claimed as a title by the recipient;
- wannabe, tryhard, would-be, attempting or desiring to be worthy of some label or title;
- supposed, purported, alleged, commonly referred to (often mistakenly or deceptively) by said name

Etymology: Middle Boral borrowing from contemporary legal Latin nuncupātus "nominal, by name", a variant of Classical nuncupātivus "so-called, nominal". These are derivatives from verb nuncupō "I name, I announce publicly".
