168.4: pereð "bulkhead"

pereð /peˈrɛθ/ [pɪˈʀɛh]
- bulkhead, a vertical separator dividing the hull of a ship into separate compartment, often made watertight;
- an inner wall in a building;
- partition, any structure that divides an area into sections;
- (anatomy) septum, a biological structure analogous to a partition and often specifically the nasal septum

Etymology: via Old Borlish pereð, paired "bulkhead" from Latin pariēs "wall". This was outcompeted outside nautical contexts by the descendant of Latin mūrus "wall (orig. of a town or city)". The word's anatomical sense is first attested from the seventeenth century in translation from Scholastic Latin.
