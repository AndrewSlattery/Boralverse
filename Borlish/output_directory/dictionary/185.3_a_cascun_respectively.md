185.3: a cascun "respectively"

a cascun /a kaˈxɪn/ [a kɐˈçɪn]
- each, apiece, (e.g. of a price) for an individual item from a set;
- per head, per capita, (of a statistic) divided by the population of the region in question;
- respectively, corresponding in the order given when comparing two lists of things;
- pointwise, (in mathematics) occuring or true independently for each point in a set

Etymology: literally "to each one", in idiomatic use attested from the twelfth century. The pronoun cascun "each one" descends directly from Vulgar Latin cascūnum "each one", a conflation of Classical quisque ūnum and Late Latin cata ūnum "each one". The phrase's use extended beyond financial and census-taking contexts through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
