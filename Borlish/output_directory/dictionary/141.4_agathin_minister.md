141.4: agathin "minister"

agathin /ˌa.gaˈθɪn/ [ˌa.gɐˈθɪn]
- minister, office-holder, official, chancellor, executive, secretary, a politician in charge of a government department;
- aide, advisor, councillor, member of a group of people advising a ruler
- (chess) queen, the piece located on on the back row in the d file

Etymology: from Middle Borlish, a borrowing from Scholastic Latin agathīnus "minister". This was altered by analogy to Greek ᾰ̓γᾰθός • agathós "good, noble, useful" from contemporary words like Italian agazzino and Barcelon agutzir "bailiff, sheriff". These originate in Arabic الوزير • al-wazīr "the minister", from which the chess sense also derives.
