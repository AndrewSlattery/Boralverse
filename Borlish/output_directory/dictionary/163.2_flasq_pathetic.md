163.2: flasq "pathetic"

flasq /flask/ [flask]
- limp, sagging, flaccid, flabby, flimsy, loose, not taut or otherwise lacking stiffness;
- unenthusiastic, half-hearted, dispassionate, tepid, lacking interest or passion;
- pathetic, pitiful, hapless, inspiring scorn or compassion due to inadequacy or ineptitude

Etymology: borrowed in the Middle Borlish period from early Norman flasque "soft, malleable". This appears to be a hypercorrected variant of earlier flaque, descending from Latin flaccus "flabby, sagging". The unetymological /s/ would reflect analogy from other words whose coda /s/ had been lost in Parisian French. The term has been applied to emotion since the seventeenth century, and to people since the nineteenth.
