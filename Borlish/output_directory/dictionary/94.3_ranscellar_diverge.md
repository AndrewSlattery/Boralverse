94.3: ranscellar "diverge"

ranscellar /ˌran.xɛˈlar/ [ˌʀan.çɪˈlɑː]
- branch, fork, bifurcate, to split into two as a path or a plant might;
- diverge, deviate, run apart, separate, vary, to tend to different directions;
- oppose, contradict, disagree, to hold different opinions or to imply different things

Etymology: verbal derivative of ranscel "branch, Y-shape, divergence", which reflects Vulgar Latin *rāmuscellum "little branch". This is a double diminutive of Classical rāmus "branch, bough, limb".
