76.2: caum "piece"

caum /kom/ [kom]
- (obsolete) prayer, psalm, canticle, a religious text when set to music;
- hymn, any song of praise or worship;
- (more broadly) song, piece of music, an individual work of musical expression with or without lyrics;
- poem, artwork, piece, any artistic creation and especially one which is written;
- article, story, report, piece of nonfiction writing as might be published in the press;
- (mesh) post, any original work (prototypically writing) published to the mesh

Etymology: disputed. Semantically it should derive from Latin carmen "poem, incantation, prayer", but the phonological development is troublesome. Vocalisatio of /r > u/ is otherwise only attested in the presence of following /r̩/, as in Maucr "Wednesday" < *Marcre < Mercuriī; this has led some scholars to postulate an Insular Latin variant *carmus, carmera, but this is unattested.

Reanalysis of the plural carmina as a feminine singular is, however, not out of the question. One might then suppose that dissimilation produced *carmira, but again this is unattested.

The word has seen significant semantic bleaching over time; the sense "poem" is first seen in the fifteen century, the sense "article" in the eighteenth, and the sense "(mesh)post" in the late twentieth.
