gallaið "galaxy"

gallaið /gaˈleθ/ [gɐˈleh]
- galaxy, collection of stars all orbiting a common centre;
- seemingly-uncountable collection of people of things conceptualised as comprising a vast variety;
- (dated) the Milky Way, the galaxy in which the Sun and Earth are found and which is most readily visible in the night sky

Etymology: from late Old Boral galaix, galais "the Milky Way", learned borrowing from synonymous Latin galaxiās and Ancient Greek (κύκλος) γᾰλᾰξῐ́ᾱς, literally "milky circle". Altered in the early Middle Boral period under the influence of laið "milk", from Latin lac, lactem "milk" (or possibly from a Borland Kelt form; compare Cambrick łaeth "milk").

Used as a proper noun until the discovery of other galaxies in the Good Game period of the late nineteenth century. Metaphorical use for other vast collections of things is seen since the seventeenth century, especially in poetry.
