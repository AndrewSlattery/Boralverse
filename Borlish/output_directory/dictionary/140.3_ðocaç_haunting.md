140.3: ðocaç "haunting"

ðocaç /ðoˈkats/ [ðʊˈkas]
- bedevilment, torment, vexation, the affliction of (especially mental) distress;
- trauma, haunting, hell, the aftereffects of terrible experiences

Etymology: noun derivation from the verb ðocar "harrow, till; afflict, bedevil, torment, haunt" with the pejorative suffix -aç (from Latin -āceus "shaped like"). The verb descends from Vulgar Latin adoccō "I till, harrow", an extension of the synonymous occō in Classical Latin. The verb gains its emotional senses in the sixteenth century.
