148.2: 17th Lexember - ja sceint "extant"

ja sceint /ʒa xint/ [ʝa çint]
- extant, in existence, surviving, not yet having disappeared or died;
- attested, recorded, present, in evidence, proven to exist or have once existed;
- (orig. law) preexisting, being present before some other event (and thus having certain legal privileges or protections)

Etymology: phrase meaning "still being there", used as legal jargon from the early Middle Borlish period. The adverb ja "already, still, yet" descends directly from Latin iam "already, now" (the homonym ja "yes" is a Germanic borrowing and thus likely unrelated). The participle sceint "being there, existing" comes from the verb sceir "for there to be" used in existential sentences (scey uncos "there is something"). This descends via Old Borlish seer, sier, scer "exist, be located" from Latin sedeō "I sit".
