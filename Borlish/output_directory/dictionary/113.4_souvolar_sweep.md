113.4: souvolar "sweep"

souvolar /ˌsu.voˈlar/ [ˌsu.vʊˈlɐː]
- sweep, be swept, to be caused to rise up into the air from the ground (as of the clothing of a person spinning, or of dust);
- glide, to move through the air gracefully and unpropelled;
- go along with something, play along, to cooperate in continuing something by passively allowing it;
- (in a performative context) yes-and, commit to the bit, take things in stride, go with the flow, stay in character

Etymology: borrowing from Latin subvolō "I fly upwards from below", adapted to existing sou- "under" and volar "fly". In metaphorical use the word is attested from the eighteenth century; in a theatrical context it is seen from 1888, originally in use by a specific school of acting in Axbane.
