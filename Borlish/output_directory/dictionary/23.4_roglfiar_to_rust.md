23.4: roglfiar "to rust"

roglfiar /rɔjlˈfjar/ [ˌʀɔ.jʊˈfjɑː]
- to rust, oxidise, to combine slowly with oxygen to form an oxide as a natural process;

Etymology: an Old Boral verbal derivation from roȝl /roʎ/ "rust, mildew" (modern rogl "rust") via the factitive ending -fi(ȝ)ar, which comes from Latin -ficō as an inherited descendant. The noun roȝl reflects Vulgar Latin robicula, a diminutive of Classical rōbīgō "rust", which is related to rōbus, rūfus "red".
