5.3: deðal "thimble"

deðal /deˈðal/ [dɪˈðaw]
- thimble, cup-shaped cap worn on the tip of a finger and used in sewing to push a needle through material
- thimbleful, traditional unit of liquid volume denoting as much as fits in a thimble and which is equal to roughly half a millilitre
- (by extension) a vague but small amount of liquid, especially of alcoholic spirits

Etymology: From Old Boral deiðal, de(ȝ)dal "thimble" (in various forms), descending from Latin digitālis "belonging to the finger". Coexisted with non-native thumel, an Old English borrowing, before supplanting it outside rural western dialects by the seventeenth century.
