183.4: nis tenir "be at fault"

nis tenir /nɪz teˈnɪr/ [nɪz tɪˈnɪː]

Etymology: idiom from the seventeenth century, originally seen in legal contexts, literally "to hold effort". The noun nis "effort, vigour; force; obligation; attention" comes from Old Boral nis, neȝs, niȝs et al. "effort, vigour", which descends uncomplicatedly from Latin nīxus, nīsus "strain, forward momentum". This is the participle of deponent verb nītor "I lean on, advance, strive, contend".
