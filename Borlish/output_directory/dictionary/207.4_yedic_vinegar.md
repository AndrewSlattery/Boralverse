207.4: yedic "vinegar"

yedic /jeˈdɪk/ [ʝɪˈdɪk]
- vinegar, a sour liquid formed from the fermentation of alcohol;
- acetic acid, the principal acidic component of vinegar;
- (attributive) irritable, narky, testy, responding nastily to any interaction

Etymology: descendant of Old Borlish iedic, edic "vinegar", borrowed from synonymous edic in Old Dutch. This is apparently a metathetic variant coming from late Classical German aceda, acita "vinegar", a borrowing from Latin acētum "vinegar" possibly influenced by related acidus "sour". The Borlish word is attested as an adjective in the modern sense from as early as the twelfth century.
