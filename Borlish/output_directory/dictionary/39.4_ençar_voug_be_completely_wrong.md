39.4: ençar voug "be completely wrong"

ençar voug /ɛnˈtsar vuj/ [ɪnˈtsɑː vuj]
- be completely wrong, to miscalculate or misjudge entirely so that one's answer or action does not resemble the correct one in any respect;
- do something incorrectly, to perform an action (especially to operate a machine or to attempt an artistic endeavour) with absolutely nothing approaching expertise or skill;
- be utterly useless at, to have no talent whatsoever for a particular skill

Etymology: Idiom attested from the sixteenth century, literally meaning "to start incorrect". The verb ençar "to begin, start" is a direct descendant of Latin initiō "I begin, originate", while the adjective voug "wrong, mistaken, incorrect" is a medieval borrowing from Old English wōh "wrong, crooked, bent" (giving modern Merch ough /uːf/ "bad").
