Etymology: descendant of Old Borlish cauȝ, cuȝ /kaˈyɣ ~ kyɣ/ "fall, descent", which reflects Latin adjective cadūcus "falling; doomed; futile; (law) lapsed". The word is seen in metaphorical use almost at once; for physical downward slopes it may have been influenced by Norman cute "fall; chute". Poetic and legal usages are both attested from the late Middle Borlish period.
