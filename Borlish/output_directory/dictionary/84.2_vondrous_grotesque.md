84.2: vondrous "grotesque"

vondrous /vɔnˈdruz/ [vʊnˈdʀuz]
- grotesque, distorted, caricatured, having abnormal proportions in a stylised manner;
- shocking, outrageous, egregious, bad in an impressive way;
- hideous, ugly, displeasing to the eye

Etymology: from Old Boral vondrous "miraculous, awe-inspiring, unbelievable", adjective derivate of vondre "miracle, marvel" (now obsolete). This is borrowed from the synonymous wundor in Old English. The worsening semantic shift was entirely complete by the seventeenth century.
