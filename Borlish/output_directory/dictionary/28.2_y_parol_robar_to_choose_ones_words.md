28.2: y parol robar "to choose one's words"

y parol robar /i paˈrɔl roˈbar/
- to phrase, to choose one's words in a particular way in order to achieve a desired effect;
- to dissemble, prevaricate, to disguise one's true intentions by employing specific phrasing

Etymology: idiom first attested in the fifteenth-century poetry of Manuel Kigman, literally meaning "to dress (up) one's words". The noun parol "word" descends directly from Vulgar Latin paraula "(the power of) speech, language", from parabola "comparison, parable"; the verb robar "to dress (someone)" is a derivation from rob "robe, dress, longcoat", which is a borrowing from Old French.
