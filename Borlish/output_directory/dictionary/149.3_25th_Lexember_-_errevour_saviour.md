149.3: 25th Lexember - errevour "saviour"

errevour /ˌɛ.reˈvur/ [ˌɛ.ʀɪˈvʊː]
- saviour, rescuer, deliverer, person who prevents danger or harm befalling another;
- the Redeemer, the figure of Jesus Christ in his role as deliverer from sin;
- (attributive, of meat) stuffed with a particular combination of breadcrumbs, wine, herbs and chestnuts

Etymology: descendant of Old Borlish erevor "saviour", agentive derivation of erevre, erever "save" (which gives modern errevir "rescue"). This comes from Latin ēripiō "I set free; I remove", related to rapiō "I grab, seize". The term has been applied to Christ along with similar sauvour, reðentor "saviour" since the tenth century. In the last sense referring to a preparation of meat now often served around Christmas on Borland (although historically it, minus the chestnuts, was usually eaten on Easter Sunday).
