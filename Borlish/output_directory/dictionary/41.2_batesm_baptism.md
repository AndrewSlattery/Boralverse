41.2: batesm "baptism"

batesm /baˈtɛ.zm̩/ [bɐˈtɛ.zɐm]
- baptism, christening, the Christian rite in which a person (usually a child) is received into the church and given a name;
- (more generally) naming, the act of giving a person or thing a name;
- induction, hazing, any ceremony whose purpose is to introduce new members to some association, especially if the process if unpleasant or even dangerous

Etymology: via Old Boral batesme "baptism, christening" and synonymous Late Latin baptisma from Ancient Greek βάπτισμα (báptisma, "dipping in water, baptism"). Used outside of a Christian context from as early as the late thirteenth century; in the last sense it arises in the student culture of Vithor in the eighteenth century.
