Etymology: Old Borlish, verbal derivation from tis, tes "taut, stretched". This descends from synonymous tēnsus in Latin, past participle of tendō "I stretch; I strive". The senses pertaining to traps and weaponry, first attested in the fourteenth century, derive from the action of arming a trap or crossbow by placing a string under tension. More general mechanical senses are attested from the seventeenth century, along with the reflexive usage.
