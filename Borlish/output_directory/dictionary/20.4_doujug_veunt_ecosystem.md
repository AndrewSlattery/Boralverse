20.4: doujug veunt "ecosystem"

doujug veunt /duˈʒaj vawnt/ [dʊˈʝaj vawnt]
- ecosystem, food web, a biological system composed of all the organisms interacting with each other in a particular physical environment;
- (by extension) any complex network of interdependent parts which is difficult to understand except by considering it as whole

Etymology: attested from the Long Peace in the late eighteenth century to translate Mashick zawalli ca'irát "web of living things", from the work of Iscoval or his contemporaries.

The noun doujug "spiderweb" descends from northern dialect phrase doun jug /dundʒəj/ "July's down feathers" (standard pluot jugler /pljɔt ʒajˈlɛr/); the noun doun "soft, immature feathers" is borrowed from synonymous Old Norse dúnn, while jug reflects Latin Iūlius "July".
