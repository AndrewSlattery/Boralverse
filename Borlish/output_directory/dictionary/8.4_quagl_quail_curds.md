8.4: quagl "quail, curds"

quagl /kwɛjl/ [ˈkwɛ.jʊ]
(1)
- quail, any of various small game birds related to pheasants or partridges, or the meat from such a bird eaten as food
- (more generally) quarry, an animal which is hunted or by extension a person or object which is being pursued
(2)
- curds, the part of milk that coagulates when it sours or is treated with enzymes
- any of several pressed, unmatured cheeses made from curdled milk with a high melting point and therefore popular in fried dishes

Etymology: in the senses at (1), a descendant of Late Latin quaccola "quail" with a somewhat irregular outcome—we would expect quacr /ˈkwa.kr̩/. One way to resolve this is to hypothesise an intermediate variant *quacula having undergone degemination; another is to suggest that the word was reborrowed from Old French coaille, which has the same origin. The metaphorical extension to other sought-after things is attested from the poetry of the sixteenth century, though is likely earlier.

In the senses at (2), a descendant of Late Latin quāglum < coāgulum "milk curd", reinforced by Portingale or Leon quallo from traders in the Old Boral period (explaining the retention of initial qu- where we would expect c-).
