147.7: 15th Lexember - kiveury "herdtale"

kiveury /ˌki.vauˈri/ [ˌki.vɐuˈʀi]
- herdtale, a genre of fiction originating in nineteenth-century Hasiny and depicting rural (prototypically, cattle-herding) life as a virtuous idyll;
- pastoralism, bucolicism, Arcadianism, the idealisation of rural life perceived as morally superior to urban modernity

Etymology: 19th-century derivative of kiveu "cattle, herd" with the suffix -ry "a collection of things, a shop, a gestalt quality", coined as a calque of Hasinic Welsh jadełath "herd-dom". The noun kiveu descends from Old Borlish kifew "cattle", a borrowing a Borland Old English cyfeoh "cattle-herd". To describe an ideology the term is seen from the early twentieth century, usually in critical contexts.
