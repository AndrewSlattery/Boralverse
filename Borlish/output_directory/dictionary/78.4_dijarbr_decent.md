78.4: dijarbr "decent"

dijarbr /diˈʒar.br̩/ [dɪˈʝɑː.bɐ]
- decent, acceptable, fine, OK, of a sufficiently-high quality but not particularly impressive;
- manageable, doable, feasible, not daunting in scope or difficulty;
- wieldy, handy, able to be handled with grace while not being overly heavy or awkwardly shaped
- (rare) digestible, edible, capable of being eaten and digested

Etymology: adjectival derivation from dijarr "to bear, cope with, deal with, stomach". This verb descends from Middle Boral dijarr "parse, classify, sort out; digest, stomach", a borrowing from Latin dīgerō "I disseminate, disperse, arrange" altered by analogy with now-archaic verb enjarr "to eat" < ingerō "I carry in, pile up".
