130.4: effus "extensive"

effus /ɛˈfɪz/ [ɪˈfɪz]
- extensive, wide-ranging, covering a large area;
- far-reaching, comprehensive, big, major, significant, affecting many things

Etymology: 16th-century borrowing from Latin effūsus "poured out, discharged", past participle of effundō "pour out, discharge" (itself borrowed at roughly the same time as effondr "spread out, disperse, scatter"). As a vaguer word simply meaning "significant" it is seen from the late 18th century.
