Etymology: agentive formation from dialect verb quallar "to ride, travel by horse", which along with qual "horse" are nonstandard variants of covallar and coval in standard Borlish. These all descend from Vulgar Latin caballus "horse", from Gaulish. In latter usages clipped from compounds desc quallour "passenger meal" and plant quallour "passenger plant".
