161.3: senglottaç "whine"

senglottaç /ˌsɛn.glɔˈtats/ [ˌsɛŋ.glʊˈtats]
- whine, whinge, moan, a noise of complaint or pain;
- gripe, grievance, cavil, a petty or trivial objection or criticism;
- any long, drawn-out, high-pitched sound (especially one which is annoying)

Etymology: nineteenth century derivative from senglot or the related verb senglottar "sob, sigh, lament". These descend from Vulgar Latin singluttus "sob, hiccup", a alteration of synoynmous singultus in Classical Latin under the influence of gluttiō "I swallow, gulp". Metaphorical use is attested from the early twentieth century.
