174.4: plentivous "brimming"

plentivous /ˌplɛn.tiˈvuz/ [ˌplɛn.tɪˈvuz]
- brimming, awash, flush, overflowing, in such an abundance as to be almost too much;
- (in physics) charged, having an electrical charge;
- suspenseful, tense, thrilling, expectant, filled with the tension of awaiting an uncertain outcome or event

Etymology: late Middle Borlish, borrowed from French plentiveus "flush, rich". This is a derivation from plentif "abundant" and plenté "abundance", via Latin plēnitās "fullness" from plēnus "full". The emotional senses, attested from the seventeenth century, appear to evoke the danger of an overfull vessel. In scientific use the word is modelled on prior plentað "fullness; (physic) electric charge" (compare the analogous plentiful "charged" in Merch).
