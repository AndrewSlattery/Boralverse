193.3: desjovar "uncouple"

desjovar /ˌdɛz.ʒoˈvar/ [ˌdɛz.ʝʊˈvɐː]
- unyoke, uncouple, unlink, to remove from a yoke or harness;
- detach, disengage, unfasten, separate, to cause to be apart;
- liberate, free, to deliver from oppression or imprisonment;
- (colloquial, reflexive) divorce, to end a marriage;
- unplug, disconnect, to sever the link between an electrical appliance and the mains

Etymology: Middle Borlish, derivative of jovar "yoke, tie together, match; (later) plug in". This is either a direct descendant of Latin iugō "I join, yoke" or more likely a re-verbing via jou < Latin iugum "yoke". The term was used metaphorically almost at once, especially in religious contexts. In both the colloquial and electrical senses the word is first attested in the nineteenth century.
