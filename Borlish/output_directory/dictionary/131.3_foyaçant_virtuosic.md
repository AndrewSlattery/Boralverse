131.3: foyaçant "virtuosic"

foyaçant /ˌfɔjɐˈtsant/ [ˌfɔjˈtsant]
- virtuosic, gifted, masterful, demonstrating immense technical skill;
- flamboyant, resplendent, dazzling, theatrical, bold or audacious in the way one does something;
- showy, showing off, peacocking, ostentatious, being prideful in demonstrating one's abilities

Etymology: present participle of foyaçar "glare, shine brightly, dazzle; show off, flaunt". This is itself a derivation from foyaç "glare, intense light; gaudiness, extravagance", an Old Borlish extension of foy "fire" < focus "hearth" with the pejorative suffix -aç < -āceus "shaped like". The noun foyaç "mess, jumble" < fodiō "I dig up" is unrelated but may have had semantic influence.

The word appears in both approving and disapproving contexts from as early as it is attested.
