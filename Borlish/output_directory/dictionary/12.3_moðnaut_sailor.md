12.3: moðnaut "sailor"

moðnaut /mɔðˈnot/ [mʊðˈnot]
- sailor, seaman, mariner, person in the business of navigating ships or a member of the crew of such;
- fellow, chap, man, a male person often held in some regard by the speaker

Etymology: from Middle Boral moðnaut "sailor", of uncertain origin. Most likely, although somewhat phonetically implausible, is that is descends from Middle Dutch matenout "bunkmate" < mate "mat, hammock" and henout "companion" (whence also Middle French matelot "sailor" and thus Kentish mattlet "(lower) seaman, below-decks shipworker".

Alternatively, an earlier origin in the (probably Horther) Old Norse compound møtu-nautr "food companion" has been proposed; some also claim that this is the original etymon later influenced in meaning by the Middle Dutch above. Despite superficial similarity, certainly unrelated to Latin nauta or Greek ναύτης <naútes> "sailor".
