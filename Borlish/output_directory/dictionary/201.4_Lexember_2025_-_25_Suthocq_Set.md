201.4: Lexember 2025 - 25: Suthocq "Set"

Suthocq /siˈθɔk/ [sɪˈθɔk]
- Set, Seth, Sutekh, an Egyptian deity with dominion over the desert and foreigners;
- Puck, Robin Goodfellow, a recurring trickster figure in various folk/fairy tales;
- an avatar of Christmas jollity in various parts of northern Europe and Mendeva, representing defiance, glittering frost and brightness in the dark

In the last sense, compare Har Suthock /haː ˈsʊ.ðʊk/ "(lit.) frost Set" in Merch, and Nacho Suthoc "(lit.) little-brother Set" in Ambrosian Vask [Basque].

Etymology: 18th century, originally in translation from Arabic سُتُخ • Sutuch "Set". This in turn comes from the very new (and still somewhat inaccurate) decipherment of hieroglyphs, leading to a surge in interest in Egyptian mythology, reflecting the name now usually transcribed as /suː.tiç/ (whence Coptic ⲥⲏⲧ /seːt/).

The transfer of the name from Egyptian mythology to general folktales is the fault of Dutch writer Ton Cráyenschot, who in the early 19th century repurposed the names of deities of various traditions for the supernatural characters in his short stories. The puckish figure of Har Suttock spread into the culture at large far more successfully than most of his inventions, and had become associated with winter festivals in general and Christmas in particular by the turn of the 20th century.
