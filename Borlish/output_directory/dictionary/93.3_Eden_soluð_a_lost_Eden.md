93.3: Eden soluð "a lost Eden"

Eden soluð /eˈdɛn soˈlɪθ/ [ɪˈdɛn sʊˈlɪh]
- lost Eden, Arcadia, Shangri-la, utopia, an imagined paradise of complete bliss and peace conceived of as being located in a distant past

Etymology: literally "an Eden that has been let go", an idiom first attested in Kigman's fifteenth-century poetry. The adjective soluð is the past participle of souvr "solve, let go, release, launch", which descends directly from the mostly synonymous solvō in Latin.
