75.4: astr mirar "stargaze"

astr mirar /ˈastr̩ miˈrar/ [ˈas.tɐ mɪˈʀɑː]
- stargaze, to look up at the stars at night;
- to perform astronomy, to act as an astronomer;
- daydream, woolgather, to have a spontaneous series of thoughts disconnected from reality

Etymology: phrase meaning "to look at stars", employing the poetic term astr "celestial body, star", borrowed from synonymous astrum in Latin. This sense of mirar "be amazed by, marvel at" to mean "look at" is also somewhat formal or poetic. In metaphorical use the phrase is seen as early as the fifteenth century.
