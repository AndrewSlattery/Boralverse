psolic "deoxygenated"

psolic /psoˈlɪk/ [psʊˈlɪk]
- deoxygenated, of lower oxidation number, containing a smaller proportion of oxygen in its chemical composition;
- pertaining to the process of incomplete combustion, whereby a fuel burns in the presence of insufficient oxygen

Etymology: originally in the latter sense to denote combustion products such as carbon monoxide (in-universe, psolick aphlox), coined by Kievan alchemist Sogut Ranhalov in 1765 and derived from Ancient Greek ψόλος (psólos) "soot, smoke".
