175.3: ollom "relic"

ollom /ɔˈlɔm/ [ʊˈlɔm]
- relic, an ancient object (originally as kept for religious veneration);
- heirloom, a valued possession passed down over generations;
- artefact, antique, a very old item;
- keepsake, souvenir, token, memento, an item with sentimental value often as a reminder of something or someone

Etymology: a descendant of Old Borlish onlom "vessel; (religion) relic", borrowed from Borland Old English ondlōma "utensil, vessel". By the thirteenth century the word had become restricted to religious usage (viewing a relic as a vessel for holy power), from which the other senses have sprung.
