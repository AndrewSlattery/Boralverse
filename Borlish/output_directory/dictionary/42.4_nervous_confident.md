42.4: nervous "confident"

nervous /nɛrˈvuz/
- confident, assured, optimistic, having confidence in one's ability to accomplish something;
- bold, fearless, daring, showing a willingness to take risks or acting without reservation;
- vigorous, robust, energetic, being healthy and strong and characterised by lively activity;
- (dated or humorous, of meat) sinewy, stringy containing tough fibres and thus being difficult to eat

Etymology: from Middle Boral nervous "sinewy; vigorous", borrowed from synonymous Latin nervōsus along with noun nerf < Latin nervus "nerve, sinew; vigour". The extension in meaning from "vigorous" to "bold" and then to "confident" had taken place by the start of the nineteenth century.
