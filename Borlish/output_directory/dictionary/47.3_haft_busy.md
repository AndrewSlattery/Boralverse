47.3: haft "busy"

haft /haft/ [haft]
- busy, occupied, engaged in activity to a sufficient extent that one would have difficulty doing something else at the same time;
- in use, occupied, active, currently being used in a way that prevents others from using the same thing;
- full, booked out, having been reserved for use entirely so that there is no space for anyone new

Etymology: via Old Boral haft "seizure, capture, imprisonment", apparently a deverbal of an unattested *haftar which would reflect Old English hæftan "to seize, capture, imprison". Its use in apposition as an adjective is seen from the fourteenth century, originally in the sense "captive, unfree" and soon after in its modern senses.
