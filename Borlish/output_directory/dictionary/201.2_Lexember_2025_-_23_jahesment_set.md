201.2: Lexember 2025 - 23: jahesment "set"

jahesment /ˌʒa.hɛˈzmɛnt/ [ˌʝa.hɪˈzmɛnt]
- device, contraption, gadget, gizmo, a clever or complicated otherwise-unspecified machine;
- set, receiver, transmitter, a piece of electronic equipment which participates in signalling (as of telegraphy, telephony or television);

Etymology: borrowed from Vascon jahesment "contraption", a derivative of jahès "harness, rig". This in turn was borrowed from Arabic جَهَاز • jahāz "gear, utensil", from a root meaning "to prepare". Specialisation to devices such as telephone or radio sets was first applied to steeplepost equipment around the turn of the 19th century.
