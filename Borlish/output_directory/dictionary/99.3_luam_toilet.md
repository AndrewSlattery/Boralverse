99.3: luam "toilet"

luam /ljam/ [ljam]
- toilet, loo, a fixture used for urination and defecation;
- toilet, restroom, water closet, washroom, a (public or private) room containing such a fixture

Etymology: late eighteenth century, originally in university slang and then in euphemistic use, borrowed from the Latin verb form luam "I will wash, cleanse". Semantic transfer from the room to the fixture had occurred by the mid-nineteenth century.

Puns involving the homophony of luam "toilet" and l'yam "the uncle" < Old English ēam "maternal uncle" are attested from 1910.
