142.2: beuscr "monster"

beuscr /bauxr̩/ [ˈbau.xɐ]
- monster, beast, an animal considered dangerous and violent;
- brute, lout, hooligan, thug, a person considered to behave like a mindless and violent beast;
- bro, dude, guy, an ironic term of approbation for a male friend (especially one who has just been particularly cool);
- (colloq, adv.) very, extremely, particularly, to a surprisingly great extent.

Etymology: somehwat muddled. The -scr ending likely descends from Latin diminutive suffix -usculus, here used in either a belittling or euphemistic sense. The rest is thought to reflect Latin bēlua "wild animal, beast", although the development of the /l/ is irregular.

In ironic usage it is attested from the early twentieth century; as a generic intensifier somewhat later. The derived comparative beuscerrem "to an even greater extent" is seen only very occasionally as a one-off neologism.
