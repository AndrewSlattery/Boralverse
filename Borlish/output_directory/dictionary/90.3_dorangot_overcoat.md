90.3: dorangot "overcoat"

dorangot /ˌdo.ranˈgɔt/ [ˌdo.ʀɐŋˈgɔt]
- overcoat, a heavy knee-length garment worn over other clothes as protection against bad weather

Etymology: from the eighteenth century, borrowed from Paris French dourangote "riding coat, overcoat". This is adapted from the now-obsolete Kentish term Durham-coat, named for the city in Northumber.
