57.3: got ag mar fondr "tilt at windmills"

got ag mar fondr /gɔt ɛj mar ˈfɔn.dr̩/ [gɔt ɛj ˈmɑː ˈfɔn.dɐ]
- tilt at windmills, go on a wild-goose chase, to persist in attempting something with no chance of success;
- waste time, faff around, to use up some period in doing nothing productive;
- (euphemistic or jocular) masturbate, jerk off, to pleasure oneself

Etymology: idiom attested in various forms since the sixteenth century, and in the modern form since the eighteenth, literally "to spill a drop of the sea". Likely at first a reference to events in a burger play of the period. Extension to the last sense is attested only from 1968 but may be much older.
