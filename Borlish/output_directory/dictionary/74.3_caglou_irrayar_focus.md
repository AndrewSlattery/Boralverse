caglou irrayar /kɛjˈlu ˌɪ.reˈjar/ [kɪjˈlu ˌɪ.ʀɪˈʝɑː]
- focus, concentrate, place emphasis, to direct energy or attention to the exclusion of other things;

Etymology: idiom from the nineteenth century, literally "to shine (a) spotlight", transferred from its literal sense in the theatre. The noun caglou "lens, perspective, focus, spotlight; thrust, gist, nub (of an idea)" comes from Norman caillow "small stone, lens", possibly of Kelt origin. The verb irrayar "to shine, radiate, illuminate"  reflects post-Classical Latin irradiō "I light up".
