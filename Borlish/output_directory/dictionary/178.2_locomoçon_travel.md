178.2: locomoçon "travel"

locomoçon /ˌlo.ko.moˈtson/ [ˌlo.kʊ.mʊˈtsɔn]
- locomotion, motion, movement, the act or capability of changing position by going from one place to another;
- travel, the activity of going from place to place (usually when in a vehicle like a car or train);
- (physics) displacement, the vector quantity measuring the difference between two points in space

Etymology: sixteenth century, borrowed from Scholastic Latin locomōtiō "movement from place to place", from Classical Latin noun locus "place" and verb moveō "I move". The word is sometimes in technical contexts contrasted with moçon "motion of parts of a body relative to other parts". Its mathematical sense is attested from the eighteenth century as the vector counterpart of scalar lonctumn "length, distance".
