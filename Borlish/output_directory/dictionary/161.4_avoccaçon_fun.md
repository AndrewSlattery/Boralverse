161.4: avoccaçon "fun"

avoccaçon /ˌa.vɔ.kaˈtsɔn/ [ˌa.vʊ.kɐˈtsɔn]
- leisure, diversion, recreation, time off from work doing activities for their own sake;
- fun, entertainment, amusement, activity designed to give pleasure or relaxation to their audience or participants;

Etymology: nominal derivation from avoccar "divert, amuse, entertain" or directly from Latin āvocātiō "distraction", both originally from Latin āvocō "I call away, distract, dissuade". The meaning was influenced by contrast to its traditional counterpart voccaçon "career, occupation".
