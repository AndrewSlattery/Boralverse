125.4: govondry "canteen"

govondry /ˌgo.vɔnˈdri/ [ˌgo.vʊnˈdʀi]
- canteen, cafeteria, a small cafe inside a larger establishment (e.g. military base, school, prison or workplace);
- tuck shop, lunch counter, snack bar, a counter selling small items of food

Etymology: Middle Borlish govonry "inn, eatery", place derivation from now-obsolete govon "innkeeper, barkeeper". This appears to descend directly from Latin caupō "tradesman, innkeeper". It specialisation to small eateries and counters within organisations takes place first in a military context during the eighteenth century.
