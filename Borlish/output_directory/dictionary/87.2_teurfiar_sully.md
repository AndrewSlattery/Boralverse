Etymology: Middle Boral derivation from noun teur "tar" with the suffix -fiar (< Latin -ficō) which forms verbs meaning "to make/render _". The noun teur is an Old Boral borrowing from Old English teoru "tar, resin, earwax", which is related to "tree". Almost immediately we see use of the verb, particularly in contemporary legal cases.
