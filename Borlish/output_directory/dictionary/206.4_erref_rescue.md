206.4: erref "rescue"

erref /ɛˈrɛf/ [ɪˈʀɛf]
- retrieval, recovery, restoration, return, salvage, the act of getting something back that was lost;
- rescue, salvation, liberation, relief, delivery, the saving of something or someone from danger;
- redemption, reformation, changing of one's character for the better

Etymology: Middle Borlish, deverbal from errevir "rescue". This reflects Old Borlish erever, erevre "save, redeem", from Latin ēripiō "I set free; I remove", related to rapiō "I grab, seize". In early use the term often had religious connotations, referring to the redemption of the world by Jesus Christ.
