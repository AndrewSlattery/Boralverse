65.4: gamblas "barge"

gamblas /gamˈblaz/ [gɐmˈblaz]
- barge, punt, flat-bottomed boat used for transport of cargo along rivers and canals;
- houseboat, a vessel such as a barge used as a dwelling

Etymology: Middle Boral borrowing from contemporaneous Kentish gamblass "barge", itself extracted from Welsh łong gamblas "canal ship". It is presumed that the first component łong "ship" was treated in Kentish by folk-etymology as the adjective "long", in a reversal of its Latin origin in (navis) longa "longship".
