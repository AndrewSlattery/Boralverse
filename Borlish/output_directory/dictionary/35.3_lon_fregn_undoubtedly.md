35.3: lon fregn "undoubtedly"

lon fregn /lɔn frijn/ [lʊɱˈfʀin]
- secure, completely safe, utterly protected from any danger or harm;
- certainly, definitely, unquestionably, without any doubt;
- no problem, no worries, phatic expression responding to an expression of thanks

Etymology: literally "without risk", phrase first seen in the sixteenth century in the first sense, extending to the second in the first few decades of its use. As a phatic expression it is briefly fashionable in the Good Game period, and returned to common use in the late twentieth century.

The preposition lon "without" descends from Latin longē "far off" (used as a preposition in Insular Latin even in the late Classical period), while the noun fregn "risk" is a borrowing from Old English frēcne "dangerous, risky".
