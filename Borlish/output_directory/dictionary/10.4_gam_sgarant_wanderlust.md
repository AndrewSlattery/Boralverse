10.4: gam sgarant "wanderlust"

gam sgarant /gam sgaˈrant/ [ˌgan.zgɐˈʀan(t)]
- wanderlust, itchy feet, a strong impulse or longing to travel;
- malaise, a generalised sense of dissatisfaction with one's current circumstances

Etymology: the phrase literally means "legs wandering" and is attested from the eighteenth century. The noun gam descends from Late Latin gamba, which itself is from Ancient Greek κάμπη (kámpē)  "turn, bend".

The verb sgarar "to wander, get lost" comes from Old Boral isgarar "to lead astray", a borrowing from Old French esgarer in the same sense. This is a derivation of garer "to place, position" which is from Frankish warón "to guard, keep watch".
