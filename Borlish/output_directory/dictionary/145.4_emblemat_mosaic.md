145.4: emblemat "mosaic"

emblemat /ˌɛm.bleˈmat/ [ˌɛm.blɪˈmat]
- mosaic, artwork comprising small coloured tiles in a pattern;
- gallimaufry, medley, mishmash, miscellany, hodgepodge, assortment, an unstructured collection of various things;
- pixellation, the lowering of screen resolution due to expanding an image or for purposes of censorship/redaction

Etymology: borrowing from Napolitan emblemata "mosaic, tilework", itself from Latin emblēma "mosiac, marquetry" or directly from Greek ἔμβλημᾰ • émblēma "insertion, ornament; mosaic". Metaphorical extension is attested from the start; the last sense is a late twentieth-century innovation.
