Etymology: originally in the first sense, a deverbal noun from dobar "confer knighthood upon, dub". This is a borrowing of Old French adober "equip, arm; dub", which appers to come from a German root related to Classical German dubilas "peg, dowel". In extended use the word is seen from as early as the fourteenth century; the first attestation of the last sense is from 1964.
