trave /traˈve/ [tʀɐˈve]
- parquetry, the technique of using wooden tiles to create geometric patterns especially as used in flooring;
- jigsaw, tangram, a puzzle in which the aim is to reconstruct a picture or shape that has been cut into small pieces

Etymology: from a specialised use of Middle French travé "crossed with wooden beams", via noun traf, tref "beam, mast" from Latin trabs "timber, beam, rafter". The puzzle sense is attested from the late nineteenth century.
