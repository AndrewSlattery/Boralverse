104.2: cougt droccað "CD"

cougt droccað /kujt droˈkaθ/ [kujt dʀʊˈkah]
- CD, compact disc, an disc-shaped form of data storage read by laser

Etymology: literally "notched disc", attested from the late twentieth century as a calque of Cambrick coetan dolkiada "disc with indentations" (partly chosen so as to preserve the abbreviation CD). The noun cougt "disc, discus; annulus, quoit" is a Middle Borlish borrowing from French couite "discus, quoit, flat stone", of unknown further origin. The adjective is related to droc "notch, indentation", from Germanic.
