30.4: baury "panic"

baury /boˈri/ [bʊˈʀi]
- panic, frenzy, overwhelming fear or anxiety;
- despair, hopelessness, the utter loss of any hope that one's circumstances can improve

Etymology: from Old Boral bauri, baari et al. "panic, alarm", borrowed from the synonymous northern dialect word baar, baor with the addition of the redundant nominal suffix -ri (modern Boral -ary). This word, whence also baurous "desperate, frantic", is of obscure origin, but the traditional view is that it descends from Latin pavor "fright, anxiety".
