124.3: fis "done"

fis /fɪz/ [fɪz]
- set, stuck, immovable, placed somewhere on a more-or-less permanent basis;
- done, complete, finished, having nothing else of an activity or project to do;
- spent, exhausted, empty, having been entirely used up;
- despairing, hopeless, resigned to the inevitability of failure or defeat;
- screwed, finished, in a hopeless situation

Etymology: past participle of figr "set down, place down, lay" used also as the past participle of figr a "finish, finish off, complete, stop" (where perhaps fis la would be more regular). In the sense of having run out of something, the word is seen from the sixteenth century; in the last senses it is seen from the seventeenth.
