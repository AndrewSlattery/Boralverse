84.3: lodrignether "technical"

lodrignether /loˌdraj.neˈθɛr/ [lʊˌdʀaj.nɪˈθɛː]
- surgical, diagnostic, pertaining to medical intervention;
- technical, procedural, operational, formal, relating to some form of protocol;
- detailed, pedantic, hair-splitting, persnickety, being (overly) concerned with rules or trivia

Etymology: first attested in the eighteenth century, adjectival derivation from somewhat older noun lodrigneth "medical intervention, operation; technique, procedure, protocol". This is borrowed from Welsh łodrinnaeth "surgery, medical intervention" (cf. also the calqued Merch handiwork "surgery"), whose root is in trinna "to handle, treat".
