139.3: zovay cavir "take a taxi"

zovay cavir /zoˈve kaˈvɪr/ [zʊˈve kɐˈvɪː]
- take a taxi, go via cab, to travel somewhere as a passenger in a taxicab;
- take the easy way out, follow the path of least resistance, to take a course of action which requires minimal personal effort

Etymology: late ninetenth century, literally "to get (a) taxi". The noun zovay "taxi" is a clipping of earlier carrot zovay "taxi carriage", often mistakenly capitalised to carrot Zovay by analogy with other types of carriage named after places.

The word was borrowed via French from Furlain slang term zovaie "coach for hire with a taximeter", literally "convenience" (one did not have to pay up front, unlike earlier hired coaches). This is a derivative of verb zovà "be useful, be convenient", from Latin iuvō "I help; I please".

In the metaphorical sense the phrase is seen only from the 1970s.
