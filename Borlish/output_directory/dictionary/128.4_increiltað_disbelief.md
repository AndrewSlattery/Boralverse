128.4: increiltað "disbelief"

increiltað /ˌɪn.krilˈtaθ/ [ˌɪŋ.kʀɪlˈtah]
- doubt, disbelief, incredulity, the inability to believe something;
- doubt, suspicion, mistrust, the inability to trust someone

Etymology: Middle Borlish noun derivation of increil "disbelieving, mistrustful", orphaned negative of (by then obsolete) creil "gullible, trusting". This descends from Latin crēdulus, whence also creu "an oath of frustration or (ironically) appreciation, lately particularly in sexual contexts", which is a 20C borrowing from Portingale créu via the meaning "idiot, git, jerk".
