197.3: plouçastr "theatre"

plouçastr /pluˈtsas.tr̩/ [plʊˈtsa.stɐ]
- pretence, charade, deception, a faked appearance or series of events;
- pantomime, harlequinade, a clowning and fantastical theatrical performance;
- farce, sham, a ridiculous or inane show;
- theatre, lip service, tokenism, window dressing, pointless actions taken entirely for the look of the thing

Etymology: nineteenth century, pejorative derivation from plouç "screen, disguise; façade, persona". This is a descendant of Latin pluteus "railing; screen", possibly via Old French. The term was originally used in the playhouse senses to describe a style of theatre imported from Saxony. In the last senses it dates to the 1940s in political criticism.
