159.2: occajonal "opportune"

occajonal /ɔˌka.ʒoˈnal/ [ʊˈka.ʝʊˈnal]
- well-timed, timely, seasonable, opportune, taking place at the correct moment;
- expedient, adventitious, convenient, happening more generally in a helpful manner;
- occasional, intermittent, on and off, occurring at many well-separated times;
- sporadic, ad hoc, catch-as-catch-can, only whenever the opportunity presents itself (indicating a lack of forethought or predictability)

Etymology: adjectival derivation from occajon "opportunity, the right moment", which is a Middle Borlish borrowing from synonymous occāsiō in Latin. The word's semantic extension is in line with similar shifts in cognates across the Romance languages.
