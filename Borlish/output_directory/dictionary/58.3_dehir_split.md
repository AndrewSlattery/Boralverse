58.3: dehir "split"

dehir /deˈhɪr/ [dɪˈhɪː]
- split, split open, dehisce, separate, to break apart (especially along a seam) and fall into two halves;
- gape, yawn, to open wide;
- burst, rupture, to come apart (often violently) due to internal pressure;
- fall apart, collapse, topple, to lose structural integrity and fall to pieces;
- (figuratively) fall apart, unravel, break down, go to pieces, to suddenly lose all hope for success (especially of plans)

Etymology: Middle Boral borrowing from Latin dehīscō "I gape, yawn, split open", used primarily in botanical contexts as of blossoms or fruits. Ending in -ir modelled after other change-of-state verbs like finir, jo finisc "to finish, I finish". In figurative use it may have been facilitated by the pre-existing metaphor of the flower as a work or achievement.
