46.3: descorçar "peer"

descorçar /ˌde.xɔrˈtsar/ [ˌde.xʊːˈtsɑː]
- peer at, eye, to look at deliberately as if with difficulty or apprehension;
- inspect, scrutinise, to examine something with great care or detail;
- (rare, literally) peel, shell, to remove the bark or peel from the surface of a tree or plant

Etymology: originally in the last sense, either a native formation in the Middle Boral period from noun scorç "bark, peel" and prefix de- indicating reversal or movement away, or else a calque of Latin dēcorticō "I remove the bark or peel" formed in the same way.

Metaphorical use is seen almost immediately and by the eighteenth century the verb has almost entirely been supplanted in its literal sense by periphrastic construction scorç delir de "to remove bark/peel from".
