51.3: 21st Lexember

livað "weary"

livað /liˈvaθ/ [lɪˈvah]
- weather-beaten, scuffed, having a damaged or discoloured surface due to exposure to the elements;
- weary, frustrated, fed up, having one's reserves of patience or contentment entirely exhausted

Etymology: past participle of livar "tan, darken, make leather from rawhide", itself a verbal derivation from noun lif "tan, oak bark or similar compound using in tanning leather". This reflects either an unattested Latinate derivative of līveō "I am bruised" or a Kelt form cognate with Cambrick łiw "dye, paint".
