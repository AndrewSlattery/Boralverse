170.3: souquondar "lurk"

souquondar /ˌsu.kwɔnˈdar/ [ˌsu.kwʊnˈdɐː]
- lurk, hide, skulk, to lie in wait out of sight;
- prowl, sneak, to move stealthily to avoid detection;
- be dormant, bide one's time, to appear to be inactive while waiting for the best opportunity;
- (botany) of a bulb, to remain underground over winter;
- (medicine) of a disease, to be asymptomatic but still contagious;
- stake out, case, to conduct surveillance upon a location

Etymology: Middle Borlish, derivation with the prefix sou "under, below" from the root aquondar, covondar et al. "lie in wait, ambush". This appears to reflect an unattested Vulgar Latin adjective *accupābundus "lurking, hiding, hunting animals", which would be a confused form influenced by Classical aucupor "I catch birds or bees" and occupō "I occupy, seize, anticipate".

The botanical sense is attested from the seventeenth century, and the medical sense from the nineteenth. The last senses appear to have arisen in journalistic circles within the past few decades.
