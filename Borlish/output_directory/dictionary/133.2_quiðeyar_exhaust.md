133.2: quiðeyar "exhaust"

quiðeyar /ˌkwi.ðiˈjar/ [ˌkwiðˈjɐː]
- exhaust, tire, frazzle, (as of work) to be physically gruelling;
- tax, challenge, to be difficult to accomplish

Etymology: the descendant of Old Borlish quiðeȝar "sicken, nauseate; unsettle, rattle, unnerve", derived from dialectal quið "belly, stomach, intestines". This is a borrowing from Old English cwiþ "womb; stomach". The shift in meaning from disgust or emotional disturbance towards hard work is complete by the eighteenth century (although related forms in rural dialects retain some earlier senses).
