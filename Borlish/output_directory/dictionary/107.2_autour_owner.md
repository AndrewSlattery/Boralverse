107.2: autour "owner"

autour /oˈtur/ [ʊˈtʊː]
- owner, possessor, proprietor, one who has something;
- author, creator, originator, someone who is responsible for the creation of something

Etymology: conflation of two unrelated words. Partly from aut "had, owned, possessed" and auteç "ownership, possession, control" with an agentive suffix, and partly a borrowing via Old French from Latin auctor "vendor; author".
