19.3: illabond "collapsible"

illabond /ˌi.laˈbɔnd/ [ˌi.lɐˈbɔnd]
- collapsible, fold-away, telescoping, designed as to fold up into a more compact form;
- (music) accordion, concertina, squeezebox, a portable wind instrument consisting of a bellows and keys;
- spyglass, a small and portable refracting collapsible telescope;

Etymology: first attested in Boral in the early eighteenth century, borrowed from slightly-earlier Vascon or possibly Kentish forms which each come from Latin illābundus "disposed to collapse", a participial form of illābor "I flow into, I tumble to ruins, I penetrate". In the last sense, shortened from veðr illabond "collapsible lenses".
