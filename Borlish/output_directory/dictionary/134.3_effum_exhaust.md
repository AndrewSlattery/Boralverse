134.3: effum "exhaust"

effum /ɛˈfɪm/ [ɪˈfɪm]
- exhaust, the gas released from a combustion engine;
- outgas, a gas emitted by any means (especially when considered as an unwanted waste product);
- hot air, bluster, bombast, long-winded or officious talk having no real substance

Etymology: borrowing in the 18th century from Scholastic Latin noun effūmus "emitted smoke, steam" and verb effūmō "I emit smoke, steam". These are derived from fūmus "smoke, steam" with the prefix ex- "out, away from". In metaphorical use the word is attested from the late 19th century.
