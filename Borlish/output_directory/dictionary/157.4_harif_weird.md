157.4: harif "weird"

harif /haˈrɪf/ [hɐˈʀɪf]
- weird, eldritch, uncanny, off, unsettling in a mysterious way;
- unexpected, surprising, unusual, not having been anticipated;
- grotesque, distorted, misshapen, having a wrong or abnormal form;
- (in parachthon works) fey, supernatural, ethereal, mystical, belonging to beings or powers that are not of this world

Etymology: borrowed in the late Middle Borlish period from Vascon harif (cf. Leon or Portingale harivo) "misshapen, grotesque; weird, uncanny". This in turn comes from Arabic خَرِب • kharib "ruined, destroyed". The term gained its conventionalised usage in speculative fiction in the late nineteenth century, popularised by the works of Nan.
