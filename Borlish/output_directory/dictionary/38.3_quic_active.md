38.3: quic “active”

quic /kwɪk/
- active, working, on, having the power of acting (especially, of moving or of functioning as a person or machine);
- in progress, ongoing, presently being undertaken;
- conscious, awake, up, (of a person) not asleep and especially being out of bed

Etymology: from Old Boral quic “alive, awake”, a borrowing from Old English cwic “living, live; intelligent, keen”. Formerly also used of plants for “thriving, growing well” which likely represents an intermediate meaning between its original sense and the more common modern usage.
