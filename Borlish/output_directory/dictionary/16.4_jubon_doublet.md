16.4: jubon "doublet"

jubon /ʒiˈbɔn/
- doublet; close-fitting jacket without sleeves (especially in more recent use);
- wrapper, wrapping; the material in which something is wrapped to protect it from the elements

Etymology: from fifteenth century jubon "doublet", borrowed via Vascon from synonymoys Mostara (al)juba, itself adapted from Arabic جُبَّة "jubbah, long garment". Variously in and out of fashion across Europe and her diasporas since the Revitalist period; notably absent for almost a century from the advent of Straightforward Fashion during the Long Peace. Extension to other wrappings and packaging is seen from the eighteenth century.
