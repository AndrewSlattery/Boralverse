Etymology: idiom attested from the late nineteenth century, literally "out of (one's) socks". Thought to have arisen in Damvath slang as a sexual metaphor (taking one's socks off prior to sleeping with someone), although in modern usage it is not considered at all obscene. The noun caucet "sock" is a diminutive of obsolete cauç "hose, stockings, tights", via Medieval Latin calcea from Classical calceus "boot".
