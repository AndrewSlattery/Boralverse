10.2: sbolognment "burden"

sbolognment /ˌsbo.lɔjnˈmɛnt/ [ˌzbo.lʊjmˈmɛn(t)]
- chore, burden, onus, an unwanted obligation imposed upon one;
- (more concretely) encumbrance, load, something unwieldy to carry around with one

Etymology: sixteenth-century noun derivation from verb sbolognar "to foist upon, saddle with", borrowed from synonymous Italian sbolognare in the Revitalist period. This verb is presumably a pejorative derivation from the name of the city Bologna, although the cultural context that led to the current sense is not well understood.
