144.3: parsemnar "dot"

parsemnar /ˌpar.sɛmˈnar/ [ˌpɐː.sɪmˈnɐː]
- plant, sow, to throw (the seeds of a crop) onto fertile ground;
- spread, disperse, scatter, sprinkle, strew, to throw anywhere in such a manner;
- broadcast, disseminate, to make widely known;
- dot, stud, to place at regular or irregular intervals across the whole expanse of something

Etymology: Middle Borlish, either a native derivation of semnar "sow, plant" or directly from a Scholastic Latin perseminō "I sow throughout" (compare cognate pessembrar in Vascon). Almost immediately extended from its agricultural roots, and used of news since the seventeenth century.
