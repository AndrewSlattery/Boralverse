33.4: gur "dread"

gur /gɪr/ [gɪː]
- dread, suspense, the feeling that something terrible is about to happen;
- gloom, pessimism, a black outlook resigned to terrible things happening
- sadness, depression, a state of melancholy

Etymology: from Old Boral g(r)ur "fear, dread", a borrowing from Old English gryre "terror, horror". This reflects Classical German grusias "fright" which is related to greusō "to frighten". Use of the noun in the shifted sense "sadness" is seen from the eighteenth century, principally in the constructions gur aïr "to be sad" and gur dar "to make sad".
