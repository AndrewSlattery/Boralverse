193.4: outrvalir "overestimate"

outrvalir /ˌut.r̩.vaˈlɪr/ [ˌu.tɐ.vɐˈlɪː]
- overrate, inflate, to imagine to be better or greater in some respect than in truth;
- highball, overestimate, to make a guess at a value that is too high;
- (reflexive) overween, boast, swagger, brag, vaunt, to act in an arrogant or conceited manner

Etymology: early Modern Borlish, derivation of valir "be worth" < Latin valeō "I am strong" with the prefix outr- < Latin ultrā "beyond" (compare independent Borlish words outr "complete, utter" and doutr "beyond"). In reflexive use the word is attested from the Long Peace period at the turn of the nineteenth century.
