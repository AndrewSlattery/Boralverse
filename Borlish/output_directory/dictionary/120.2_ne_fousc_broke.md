120.2: ne fousc "broke"

ne fousc /ne fux/ [nɪˈfux]
- broke, penniless, destitute, having no money;
- bankrupt, ruined, in a position of not having enough money to pay one's debts

Etymology: nineteenth-century idiom literally meaning "in (a) pit". The noun fousc "pit, hole in the ground; trap, snare, pitfall" descends with meaning pracatically unchanged via Old Borlish fouz /futʃ/ from fovea in Latin. The coventionalised intensifier for this idiom is arð "steep", which has been analogised to other expressions for poverty; cf. povr arð "very poor".
