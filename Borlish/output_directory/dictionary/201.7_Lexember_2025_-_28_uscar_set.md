This is a borrowinng of Kentish usher "doorman", via synonymous ussier in Old French and ultimately ōstiārius in Latin. This etymon is an agentive formation from ōstium "door". The word was first used for changing the orientation of inanimate objects in the 19th century, and in the computing sense in theoretical work during the 1910s.
