101.3: scroçabr "agonising"

scroçabr /xroˈtsa.br̩/ [xʀʊˈtsa.bɐ]
- agonising, painful, excruciating, torturous, causing extreme pain;
- harrowing, terrifying, nerve-racking, causing extreme fear or emotional distress;
- (sometimes proscribed) bothersome, exasperating, vexing, mithering, causing annoyance

Etymology: derivative of scroçar "to agonise, torment, vex", which descends directly via Old Borlish from synonymous excruciō "I torture" (related to cruciō "I crucify"). The last sense is disliked by some but is attested from the early nineteenth century.
