117.2: mallovicher "naïve"

mallovicher /ˌma.lo.viˈkɛr/ [ˌma.lʊ.vɪˈkɛː]
- naïve, rose-tinted, ingenuous, overly optimistic or blind to obvious pitfalls and downsides;
- chipper, bubbly, pert, peppy, cheerful in an annoying way

Etymology: 19C, adjectival derivation from mallovic "someone who is naïve and cheerful to a ridiculous or irritating extent". This is a borrowing from synonymous Merch mallowick or directly from the character Mall-Lowick /ˈmal ˈlu.ɪk/ and her eponymous novel, in which she is a young girl subjected to various travails but never losing her hopeful demeanour. Her name is a compound of Mall, a hypocoristic form of Mary, and Lowick, which comes via Old French Loïc from Frankish Hloðwig (cf. Vascon Luixa and Napolitan Ludgia [and IRL Louise]). The name was applied almost immediately in a mocking way to a person seen as similar to Mall-Lowick.
