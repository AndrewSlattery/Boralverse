107.4: collujon "bloc"

collujon /ˌkɔ.liˈʒɔn/ [ˌkɔ.lɪˈʝɔn]
- bloc, alliance, confederation, federation, a group of states acting together and linked to a significant extent both politically and economically;
- pact, treaty, compact, agreement, a document with binding legal force conducted by subjects of international law

Etymology: Middle Borlish, originally restricted to pejorative use and directed at one's political enemies. Borrowed from Latin collūsiō, noun derivative of collūdō "to collude, to secretly work (with someone) to the detriment of another". Nowadays used neutrally for alliance-federacies like the Drengot Collusion.
