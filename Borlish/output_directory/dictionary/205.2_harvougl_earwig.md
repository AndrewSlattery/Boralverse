205.2: harvougl "earwig"

harvougl /harˈvujl/ [hɐːˈvwɪl]
- earwig, any of various winged insects with elongated bodies and rear-pointing pincers;
- earbud, a small speaker placed into the ear canal;
- (intelligence) handler, someone at a base who remotely directs an intelligence asset in the field

Etymology: originally in the first sense, from Old Borlish horvoȝl, erveȝl "earwig". Thought to be partially from Vulgar Latin forficula "small scissors", diminutive of forfex "scissors", and partially from Old English ēarwicgel "earwig". The development of the initial consonant is unexplained, but compare Vascon horveix "earwig". Folklore connecting the insect to ear-burrowing influenced the modern senses, first attested in the twentieth century.
