27.3: kireðam “wholeheartedly”

kireðam /ˌki.reˈðam/ [ˌki.ʀɪˈðam]
- wholeheartedly, sincerely, earnestly, without any reservations or other any other mitigating factors;
- full steam ahead, balls-out, recklessly, with great abandon heedless of any negative consequences

Etymology: appears in the seventeenth century in the standard language, taken from an earlier northern dialect idiom cur eð am "earnestly" (often written as one word). The phrase literally means "heart and soul"; the first noun may have been influenced in its vowel by medieval Borland English hierte /ˈhi͡yrte/ "heart", while the second descends directly from Latin anima (the modern language having reborrowed anim "soul").
