32.4: vraseyant "impressive"

vraseyant /ˌvra.ziˈjant/ [vʀɐˈzjant]
- impressive, splendid, surprisingly good and tending to make a positive impression;
- moving, affecting, having a strong effect on somebody and especially causing them to feel a strong emotion;

Etymology: participial adjective from verb vraseyar "to impress, to surprise (positively), to move emotionally", itself a late medieval borrowing from Saxon wrasijn "to impact, affect, impress". This is thought to be of Slavic origin, from some descendant of *raziti "to strike, to astound" (usually supposed to be Polish wraziç "to instil, push").
