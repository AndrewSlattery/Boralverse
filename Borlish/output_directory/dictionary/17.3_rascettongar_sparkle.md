17.3: rascettongar "sparkle"

rascettongar /raˈxɛ.tɔnˈgar/ [ʀɐˈçɛ.tʊŋˈgɑː]
- sparkle, twinkle, scintillate, to shine as if throwing off sparks or to emit flashes of light;
- crackle, spark, to make a fizzing/popping sound as of a lively fire;
- engross, fascinate, captivate, spellbind, to evoke an intense interest or attraction in someone

Etymology: verbalisation of Middle Boral noun (ra)scetonc "spark, flash of light", [the initial ra- seems for a while to have been reanalysed as an intensive prefix] from Old English adjective ræscettung "sparkling, gleaming". The related verb ræscettan "crackle" reaches western dialects of Boral as scettar "[of metal] to glitter, to be valuable" (possibly influenced in meaning by scet "coin").
