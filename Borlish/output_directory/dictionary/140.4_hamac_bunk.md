140.4: hamac "bunk"

hamac /haˈmak/ [hɐˈmak]
- bunk, berth, cot, one of a series of beds installed in rows or tiers (especially in a nautical context);
- hammock, a hanging bed made of cloth or netting;
- swing, a seat hanging from two cords or cables and free to move back and forth;
- (mechanics) oscillation, harmonic motion, the behaviour of an object undergoing a returning force proportional to its distance from equilibrium

Etymology: originally in the second sense, borrowed via Morrove Arabic همك · hamaca and French hamac from Tainow [Taino] hamaca "hammock". Extended in two directions, to various cramped sleeping arrangements aboard ships as well as to other swinging objects. The word's use in physics is attested from the nineteenth century.
