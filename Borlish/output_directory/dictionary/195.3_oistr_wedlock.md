195.3: oistr "wedlock"

oistr /ˈɔjs.tr̩/ [ˈɔi.stɐ]
- (poetic) marriage, wedlock, matrimony, the state of being married;
- unity, agreement, consonance, harmony, compatibility, the condition of fitting well together

Etymology: borrowed in the early modern period from old northern dialect term oistre "wife", which descends directly from synonymous uxor in Latin (compare Old French uissor "wife"). The shift in meaning appears to be due to the poet Bautrmeu, who introduced the term to standard Borlish in her work Mornç a Morn "A Piece of the Action". It is presumed that she misinterpreted the (even then archaic) northern idiom prendr n'oistr "to wed, lit. to take as wife" as "to take in wedlock".
