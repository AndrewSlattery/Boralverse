38.4: hiat “pause”

hiat /hjat/ [çat, jat]*
- pause, lull, a period of reduced activity;
- gap, break, an interval in space or time which interrupts an otherwise-continuous object or process;
- (theatre, film) intermission, interval, the break between two parts of a drama;
- (music notation) rest, a symbol indicating that one’s instrument is not to be played

Etymology: sixteenth-century borrowing reflecting Norman hiat, Lombard hiato or another similar cognate, originally in the musical sense. These are taken directly from Latin hiātus “opening, gap, aperture, cleft”, a noun derivation from hiō “I yawn, gape, am open”.
