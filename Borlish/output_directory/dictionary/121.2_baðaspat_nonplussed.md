121.2: baðaspat "nonplussed"

baðaspat /ˌba.ðaˈspat/ [ˌbaðɐˈspat]
- nonplussed, bewildered, perplexed, puzzled, thrown, at a loss, in a state of confusion;
- indignant, outraged, startled, astonished, in a state of heightened emotion and reflexive disapproval

Etymology: first mentioned in the eighteenth century as a new piece of fashionable slang, probably of dialectal origin. Thought to be a compound; the first part is a form of baðar, local variant of sbayar "gawp, goggle" descending from Medieval Latin (ex)batō, exbadō "I gape, yawn". The second part spat is presumably a variant of spait, past participle of spagir "frightened, scared" and descending from Vulgar Latin expaveō "I am terrified of".
