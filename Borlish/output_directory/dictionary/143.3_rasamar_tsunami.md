143.3: rasamar "tsunami"

rasamar /ˌra.zaˈmar/ [ˌʀa.zɐˈmɐː]
- tsunami, tidal wave, a very large and destructive wave as caused by an earthquake or eruption;
- flood, onslaught, onrush, the sudden appearance of a large number or mass of things or people

Etymology: Middle Borlish, a univerbation of the earlier phrase ras a mar "onrush of sea". The now-obsolete word ras "rush, stampede, running" was borrowed either from Old English or Norse. In metaphorical use the word rasamar is attested from as early as the fifteenth century.
