179.2: martelment "thud"

martelment /ˌmar.tɛlˈmɛnt/ [ˌmɐː.tɪlˈmɛnt]
- hammering, pounding, the act of hitting something with a blunt implement;
- thud, thump, whack, knock, the sound made by a blunt collision;
- emphasis, accent, stress, focus, drawing attention to something particular

Etymology: noun derivation from martellar "hammer, pound; emphasise, accentuate", which itself comes from noun martel "hammer". This descends from Late Latin martellus "hammer", a variant diminutive of synoymous marculus in Classical Latin. This term developed its metaphorical senses in tandem with the verb, during the late Middle Borlish period.
