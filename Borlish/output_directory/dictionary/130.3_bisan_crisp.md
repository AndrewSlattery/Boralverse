130.3: bisan "crisp"

bisan /biˈzan/ [bɪˈzan]
- crisp, fresh, (of the air) dry and cold;
- bracing, refreshing, invigorating, giving someone energy or alertness;
- candid, hard-hitting, blunt, frank, truthful without consideration for finer feelings

Etymology: originally in the first sense, a Middle Borlish derivation from now-obsolete bis "cold air; specifically, a north wind". This is borrowed via French bise "north wind", of uncertain origin. Possible connections include Tuscan bigio "grey, cloudy" or Classical German *bibō "I shiver".
