26.3: madarc "beat cop"

madarc /maˈdaʀk/ [mɐˈdɑːk]
- lawman, beat cop, police officer and especially one on patrol;
- (dated, Axbane and environs) truncheon, cudgel, a short heavy club used as a weapon

Etymology: in its current sense formed in the early twentieth century by metonymy from its original meaning, from the prevalent use of such clubs by city constabularies. Meaning "club" it is much older; a Middle Boral borrowing from Arabic مَطَارِق‎ (maṭāriq) "hammer, fighting club", plural noun from the verb stem meaning "to knock, to hammer".
