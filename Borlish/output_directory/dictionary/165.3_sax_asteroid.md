165.3: sax "asteroid"

sax /saks/ [saks]
- asteroid, planetoid, comet, a naturally occurring solid object orbiting the Sun which is too small to become spherical under gravity;
- (specifically) such a small body located with the cisjovial ring [asteroid belt]

Etymology: 1813, a borrowing from Latin saxum "stone, rock", used as a calque from synonymous tsa'ra in Mashick Arabic. The term was originally used to describe the various apparently-pointlike bodies in the cisjovial ring, which at that time were being discovered by telescope. The first celestial body this word was applied to, Ixion [Ceres], is now known to be spherical under gravity and so is no longer considered to be a sax. In modern usage saxes include comets, although knowledge of comets dates back to antiquity.
