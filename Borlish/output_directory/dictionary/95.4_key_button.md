95.4: key "button"

key /ki/ [ki]
- button, a fastener for fabric comprising a knob or disc passed through a loop or hole;
- toggle, pin, a rod-shaped fastener bound at right angles to a cord
- switch, toggle, button, a physical device that is pressed to (de)activate a mechanism (or a virtual representation of such a device);
- key, one of several small buttons corresponding to characters on a device for typing text

Etymology: from Old Borlish key, keȝ, caiȝ "toggle, dowel, pin for securing rope or fabric", a dialect form of stanard caiȝle /ke(j)ʎə/ (soon lost). This reflects Vulgar Latin cavicla (cf. French cheville, Venisian caúcia), from Classical Latin clavicula "bolt, bar, small key".
