126.4: soccos destr "red-handed"

soccos destr /sɔˈkɔz ˈdɛstr̩/ [sʊˈkɔz ˈdɛ.stɐ]
- made, rumbled, caught, red-handed, having been discovered doing deceitful or illicit behaviour;
- unmasked, exposed, outed, having had some formerly secret information revealed

Etymology: past participle of soccoðr des "to shake out of; to unmask". The verb soccoðr "shake, mix up" descends directly from Latin succutiō "toss up, fling into the air". The adverb destr "out of there" reflects Latin dē "from" and exter "on the outside".
