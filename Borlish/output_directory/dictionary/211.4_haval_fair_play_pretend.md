211.4: haval fair "play pretend"

haval fair /haˈval fer/ [hɐˈval feː]
- play pretend, make believe, role-play, to engage in imaginative activity;
- feign, dissemble, put on an act, to perform insincerely;
- go through the motions, to do something perfunctorily or without conviction

Etymology: idiom from the sixteenth century, literally "do dolls". The noun haval "doll, puppet" was originally a southern dialect term out of Pentrose, borrowed in the Middle Borlish period from Welsh haval "likeness, image; doll, effigy". Extension out of the realm of childhood play is seen from the nineteenth century.
