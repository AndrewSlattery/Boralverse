177.2: ubicqfeyar "promote"

ubicqfeyar /ˌi.bɪk.fiˈjar/ [ˌi.bɪkˈfjɐː]
- market, publicise, promote, to make everyone aware of;
- popularise, to cause to be mainstream or fashionable;
- (reflexive) go viral, trend, to suddenly become popular or well-known;

Etymology: twentieth century, a derivation from adjective ubicq "ubiquitous, omnipresent" < Latin ubīque "everywhere" with the causative suffix -feyar < Latin -ficō "I make _". This was originally a somewhat derogatory term for annoying advertisement. The word has not entirely shaken off this connotation, partially due to its shared root with the totalising ideology of Ubiquity to which many of Borland's geopolitical rivals subscribed during this period.
