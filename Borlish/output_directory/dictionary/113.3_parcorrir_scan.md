113.3: parcorrir "scan"

parcorrir /ˌpar.kɔˈrɪr/ [ˌpɐː.kʊˈʀɪː]
- scan, examine, go over, skim, to look at sequentially or from one end to the other;
- traverse, cross, to go through;
- rehearse, to practise by acting out

Etymology: Middle Borlish borrowing from Latin percurrō "I run through; I look over", modelling on inherited par- "through" and corrir "to run". In the last sense it is attested from the eighteenth century.
