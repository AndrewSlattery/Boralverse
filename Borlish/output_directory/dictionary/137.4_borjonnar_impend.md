137.4: borjonnar "impend"

borjonnar /ˌbɔr.ʒɔˈnar/ [ˌbɔː.ʝʊˈnɐː]
- impend, forthcome, loom, be imminent, show signs of, to be about to start;
- bring forward, prepone, expedite, accelerate, to make something happen sooner

Etymology: Middle Borlish verb from borjon "bud; beginning, first sign", cognate with Old French burjon "bud, sprout". This is either from Frankish burio "offshoot, descendant", or from Latin burriō "down, fluff" (or both). Proscribed in the latter senses by stickler, although attestations are widespread from the 19th century.
