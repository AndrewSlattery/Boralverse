137.3: tourf "furore"

tourf /turf/ [tʊːf]
- furore, uproar, outcry, tumult, a loud or angry commotion;
- protest, riot, demonstration, gathering of people in public to demand something

Etymology: early modern borrowing from Welsh twrf "disturbance; crowd, mob", itself originally a borrowing from Latin turba "disorder; throng". The word gained currency during the Democratic Wars of the mid-eighteenth century, form which it obtained its political undertones.
