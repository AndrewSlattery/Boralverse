118.3: balis "beacon"

balis /baˈlɪz/ [bɐˈlɪz]
- beacon, signal fire, a warning light to communicate some message (especially in a military context);
- lighthouse, a tower supporting a light to guide sailors;
- (metaphorically) anything designed to be extremely conspicuous or mark the way;
- aerial, antenna, a device for transmitting electronic signals into the form of radio waves

Etymology: a borrowing via Middle French balise "beacon; buoy" from contemporary Portingale baliza "buoy". This appears to be from an unattested Late Latin pālītia, related to pālus "stake, post". In the sense "lighthouse" it is clipped from the phrase tour balis "beacon tower"; in the last sense it is attested from the early twentieth century.
