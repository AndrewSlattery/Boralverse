81.2: ajoutaçar "be fun"

ajoutaçar /ˌa.ʒu.taˈtsar/ [ˌa.ʝʊ.tɐˈtsɑː]

    be fun, entertain, divert, engage, to be interesting in an enjoyable way;
    charm, please, delight, to receive pleasure or satisfaction from something

Etymology: eighteenth-century verbal derivation from ajoutaç "gratification, enjoyment, satisfaction", itself derived from ajoutar "gratify, help out, please" with the somewhat-pejorative or diminishing suffix -aç (from Latin -āceus "shaped like"). This root verb descends via Old Boral aioftar from post-Classical Latin adiuvitō "I help out, assist, am useful", from earlier synonymous adiuvō with a frequentative derivation.
