161.2: sbayour "bystander"

sbayour /sbɛˈjur/ [zbɪˈʝʊː]
- bystander, onlooker, witness, spectator, rubbernecker, a person present at but not involved in some event;
- voyeur, peeping Tom, someone viewing a scene from hiding for their own  (often erotic) pleasure;
- gossip, busybody, quidnunc, nosy parker, somebody considered to have an inappropriate interest in others' affairs

Etymology: first seen with the later senses in the nineteenth century, agentive derivation from sbayar "gawp, goggle". This reflects Medieval Latin exbadō "I gape", from early slang verb badō "I yawn". Originally the term was exclusive negative or insulting; by the early twentieth century more neutral usage begins to be attested.
