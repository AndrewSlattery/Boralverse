146.4: 5th Lexember - roç "cabbie"

roç /rɔts/ [ʀɔts]
- cabbie, taxi driver, driver hired by a passenger and paid according to the distance and time of the trip;
- cab, taxi, the vehicle driven by such a person

Etymology: early 20C from Napolitan rozzo "cabbie", further origin disputed. Formally identical with earlier rozzo "boor, lout", from Latin adjective rudis "rough, unskilled, rude", but this term seems to have been obsolete by the mid-19th century. Occasionally identified with dialect ruzza "wheel", from Latin rotula "small wheel, scroll".
