94.7: jusser "downstairs"

jusser /ʒɪˈsɛr/ [ʝɪˈsɛː]
- downstairs, on a lower storey;
- downwards, lower, further down, below, at an inferior point along some space or scale;
- more specific, more particular, focused more on details or applying in fewer contexts

Etymology: redundant adjectival derivative of Old Borlish juss "below, further down", from late Insular Latin iūrsum, iūssum, a nonstandard form of Classical deorsum "downwards". In the latter sense extended by analogy to tauger "upstairs; more general".
