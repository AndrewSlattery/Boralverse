31.3: guyer “anti-clockwise”

guyer /gaˈjɛr/ [gɐˈʝɛː]
- anticlockwise, (of circular motion) moving so as to progress in the opposite direction to the shadow of a gnomon on a sundial;
- awkward, perverse, obstinately refusing to act correctly or in a conventional manner

Etymology: borrowed in the eleventh century from Old French adverb guier “in the opposite direction, anti-clockwise” (modern guyaire by analogy with solaire “solar, clockwise”), from Frankish wither “back, against, again”. The word is attested in metaphorical use from as early as the thirteenth century, in records of medieval springtide ballads.
