37.2: seucq "footpath"

seucq /sawk/
- footpath, trail, a way set intentionally for people to walk along;
- trail, tracks, footsteps, those marks left by an animal or vehicle after it has passed by and which can be followed;
- legacy, aftereffects, impact, the consequences of a person's life and the ways in which they have changed the world;
- (in particular) descendants, progeny, one's children and their children etc. as opposed to one's forebears

Etymology: from Old Boral seucque, siuke "track, path", from Borland Latin silqua, sēlqua "track, trail (of an animal)". Thought to reflect a Borland Kelt word *seilquar, from earlier *sleiquro (in which case cognate with Welsh łωybr "path").  Extended in sense to metaphorical "things left behind one" at least by the fifteeneth century but probably earlier.
