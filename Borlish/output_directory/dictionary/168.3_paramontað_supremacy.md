168.3: paramontað "supremacy"

paramontað /ˌpa.ra.mɔnˈtað/ [ˌpa.ʀɐ.mʊnˈtah]
- supremacy, dominance, primacy, precedence, the quality of having power or priority;
- liegedom, suzerainty, the political arrangement inverse to vassalage in which one polity has legal control over the governance of another

Etymology: nominal derivation from paramont "supreme, primary". This is a borrowing from Old French, a univerbation of par amont "by upward", from Latin per "through" and ad montem "to a mountain; upwards". The word was originally used in the thirteenth century to describe the relation of the Drengot Emperor over the kings in his demesne.
