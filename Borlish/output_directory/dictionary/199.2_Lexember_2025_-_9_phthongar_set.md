Etymology: originally in the first sense and specifically in religious contexts, as of writing choral music whose lyrics were taken from a particular hymn or homily. The term is a borrowing from Scholastic Latin phthongō "I set (to music)", itself from synonymous φθογγῶ • (phthongṓ) in Malchassian Greek. Broadening of the word's senses to other forms of art and writing is seen from the eighteenth century.
