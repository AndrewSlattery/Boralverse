174.2: de sanc ðus "horny"

de sanc ðus /de sank ðɪz/ [de saŋk ðɪz]
- hot-blooded, hot-tempered, heated, easily provoked to anger or excitement;
- passionate, ardent, zealous, fervent, given to strong expression of emotions;
- horny, lustful, torrid, beset by sexual feelings

Etymology: idiom attested from the seventeenth century, coined approximately at the same time as de sanc freit "cold-blooded, emotionless", literally meaning "of burning blood". The noun sanc "blood" descends directly from Latin sanguis "blood" (albeit from a Vulgar oblique form like sanguem rather than Classical sanguinem). The adjective ðus "on fire" is the past participle of now-archaic verb ðurr "burn (tr.), set on fire", which reflects Latin adūrō "I kindle, set fire to". In the last senses the phrase is attested from the nineteenth century.
