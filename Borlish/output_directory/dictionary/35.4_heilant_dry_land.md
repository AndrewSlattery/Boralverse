heilant /hiˈlant/
- dry land, terra firma, land as opposed to the sea (or later, the sky);
- landmass, a (typicaly large) continuous area of land surrounded by sea

Etymology: descendant of late Old Boral halant, haglant, helant etc. "dry land, places inland", a borrowing from Old English hēahland "the high ground". Formerly in use as an adverb meaning "inland, away from the shore" but replaced in this sense by derim by the seventeenth century outside of rural dialects.
