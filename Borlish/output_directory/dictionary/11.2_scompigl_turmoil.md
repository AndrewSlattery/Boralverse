11.2: scompigl “turmoil”

scompigl /xɔmˈpajl/ [xʊmˈpa.jʊ]
- disruption, turmoil, upheaval, a state of rapid change and impermanence as an interruption to  the flow or sequence of something;
- (more generally) havoc, chaos, widespread devastation or mayhem

also scompiglar /ˌxɔm.pajˈlar/ [ˈxɔm.pɐjˈlɑː] to disrupt, to thow into chaos

Etymology:  Borrowed in both noun and verb forms from Italian scompiglio, scompigliare "(to cause a) mess" in the Middle Boral period. The Italian is a derivation of pigliare "to grab", which descends from Latin pilō  "to pull out hair, to plunder"—whence also Boral piglar "to loot,  pillage" (which may have influenced the modern meaning).
