zygom /ziˈgɔm/ [zɪˈgɔm]
- valve, device that controls the flow of a gas or fluid through a pipe
- switch, device that controls the flow of electric current through wires
- (canal) lock, segment of a waterway enclosed by gates used to raise or lower boats
- (by extension) airlock, airtight chamber providing access to a sealed area without allowing air out or water in

also derived verb zygomar /ˌzi.goˈmar/ [ˌzi.gʊˈmɑː] to operate a valve or switch; to act as a valve or switch

Etymology: first attested in Boral from the seventeenth century, a borrowing from Scholastic Latin zygoma "(anatomy) valve, canal lock", which is from Greek ζῠ́γωμᾰ (zúgōma) "bolt, bar, yoke, cheekbone, canal lock". It displaces native sclus "canal lock" outside dialect usage by the early twentieth century. The senses "switch; airlock" are clippings of original compounds zygom baric "electric valve" and cambr zygom "valve room" respectively.
