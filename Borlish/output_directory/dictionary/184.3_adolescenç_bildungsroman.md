- bildungsroman, coming-of-age story, a genre of tales about the growth (in several senses) of characters from children to adults

Etymology: Middle Borlish, a borrowing from Scholastic Latin adolēscentia "maturation, growing up", nominal derivative of Classical verb adolēscō "I grow up, become an adult". In the meaning of a type of tradition, the word is a clipping of former phrase rit d'adolescenç "coming-of-age rite". The term was first used for the literary genre in the early 20C to describe the works of London author Dorotha Quistack.
