13.3: groglon "brook"

groglon /grɔjˈlɔn/ [gʀʊjˈlɔn]
- brook, beck, stream, a small watercourse especially flowing over rough and rocky terrain;
- (more generally) a small flow of any liquid, as of water poured from a handheld vesssel

also a groglon "(of alcohol etc) on tap, available directly from a barrel or other storage by means of a valve"

Etymology: via metathesis from Old Boral gorȝlon /gɔrˈʎɔn/ "flow of water, small stream", itself descending from Latin gurguliō "windpipe, gullet". It is plausible that its use in reference to drinking is retained from the Latin, but it is not attested in writing until the fifteenth century.
