2.3: dessoclar "to topple"

dessoclar /ˌde.soˈklar/ [ˌde.sʊˈklɑː]
- to topple, push or throw something over, especially something intentionally erected
- to overthrow a regime or oust someone from a position of authority

Etymology: from Middle Boral desçoclar "to topple, knock over", a verbal derivation from noun çocle "pedestal, plinth" (cf. modern but archaic çocr "bust, head-and-shoulders statue"). This is a thirteenth-century borrowing either from Vascon çocle "plinth" or perhaps directly from Mostara zocolo, both from Latin socculus "little shoe".
