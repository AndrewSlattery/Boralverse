180.3: vanaglous "jargony"

vanaglous /ˌva.nɛiˈluz/ [ˌva.nɪiˈluz]
- vernacular, vulgar, colloquial, slangy, basilectal, demotic, coming from informal speech as used in lower-class contexts;
- jargony, technical, filled with specialised or technical vocabulary;
- obscurantist, obfuscating, sesquipedalian, grandiloquent, difficult to comprehend due to overuse of complicated or rare verbiage

Etymology: nineteenth century, adjectival derivation from vanagl "cant, jargon, slang". This reflects Old Borlish vanagle "the Borlish language (as opposed to Latin)", which is thought to reflect Latin vernāculus "native, domestic". This comes from the root verna, which refers to a homeborn slave.
