24.3: gaddar "screw"

gaddar /gaˈdar/ [gɐˈdɑː]
- to screw, to connect or assemble pieces of a construction using a screw;
- to hang on to, to grasp a surface tightly so as not to be pulled off;
- to propel oneself through water or air by the action of a screw propeller

Etymology: verbal derivation from obsolete gad (modern Boral gaddet "screw"), descending from Old Boral gad(d) "rivet, bolt". This in turn is a medieval borrowing from Old English gád "metal point, spearhead" or Old Norse gaddr "spike".
