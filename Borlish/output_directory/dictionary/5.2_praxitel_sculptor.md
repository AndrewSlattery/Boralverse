5.2: praxitel "sculptor"

praxitel /ˌprak.siˈtɛl/ [ˌpʀak.sɪˈtɛw]
- sculptor, artist who produces sculptur and especially statuary
- (sensu latu) artist, one who shows great skill and artistry in their craft
- carving knife, as used in carpentry to pare or smooth wood and as used to cut large cooked meat dishes
- ski, one of a pair of long flat runners designed for gliding over snow
- (archaic or ironically) gynophile, lover of women, one who appreciates the female form to an exaggerated extent

Etymology: in the first sense attested from the fourteenth century, a genericisation from renowned Athenian sculptor Praxiteles. First citation of more general use for skilled craftspeople is in the poetry of Dronimir, while the knife sense appears roughly contemporaneously in expository culinary texts.

Meaning "ski" it is a clipping of earlier sci praxitel "sculptor's ski", originally referring to a specific type of ski shaped so as to experience less friction in turns. Finally, the sculptor Praxiteles' work on the nude female body inspired the late eighteenth-century varsity slang term, which spread into more widespread use in the following decades and survives in the language mostly as a self-consciously old-fashioned term.
