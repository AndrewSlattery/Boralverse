8.2: sviðour "fan"

sviðour /sviˈður/ [zvɪˈðʊː]
- (archaic) day labourer, itinerant worker, one who travels to find employ which is usually temporary and revocable at any time
- patron, regular, customer of an establishment who is a reliable source of custom and so is well-known there
- fan, enthusiast, aficionado, one who admires a particular person or thing usually to the point of zealotry

Etymology: originally in the first sense (all the newer senses are attested from the late nineteenth century only), having shifted slightly from the more specific "(itinerant) farm labourer". In this use it is an agentive derivation from earlier (and similarly archaic) svið "area of farmland, especially one that has been newly-cleared for cultivation".

This noun descends from Old Boral svið(re) "field cleared by burning; the practice of clearing fields for cultivation by burning", which is a borrowing either from Old Norse sviða "to burn" or from sviðna "to be burnt".
