97.2: ignoscr "forgive"

ignoscr /ajˈnɔ.xr̩/ [ɐjˈnɔ.xɐ]
- forgive, pardon, excuse, to let go of negative feelings towards or the desire for punishment;
- overlook, to pretend not to have noticed or choose not to point out (a flaw);
- waive, remit, forgo, to relinquish a right or claim

Etymology: Middle Borlish borrowing from Latin ignōscō "forgive, pardon", perhaps influenced in some uses by similar-looking ignorar "not know, fail to perceive". Its conjugation is modelled on connoscr "to know of, to be familiar with".
