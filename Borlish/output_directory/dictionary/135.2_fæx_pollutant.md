135.2: fæx "pollutant"

fæx /fɛks/ [fɛks]
- slag, dross, waste products from some chemical process (including mining or combustion);
- waste, detritus, any discarded or unwanted material;
- pollutant, a harmful substance which contaminates the environment;
- (figuratively) dregs, scum, the worst and lowest part of something (especially of people)

Etymology: modern borrowing from Scholastic Latin faex "unwanted product of a chemical reaction", a specialised use of Classical faex "sediment, brine, rouge, dregs". Extension from scientific usage is attested from the eighteenth century, and its use as an insult is seen soon afterwards.
