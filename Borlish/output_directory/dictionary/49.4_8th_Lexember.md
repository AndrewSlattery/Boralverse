ploghar "process"

ploghar /plɔˈjar/ [plʊˈʝɑː]
- till, cultivate, plough, to prepare (ground) for the growing of crops;
- process, render, work on, to apply a given process to;
- alter, synthesise, convert, to cause to undergo a process so as to turn a material into something else

Etymology: from Old Boral ploȝar "to till, plough" and now-obsolete noun plouȝ "plough", both originally in western dialects and borrowed from Old English plōg "land for ploughing, (later) plough". In its latter senses it is a metaphorical extension from the agricultural use, seen from the fifteenth century.
