43.2: janualtað "hindsight"

janualtað /ˌʒa.njalˈtaθ/ [ˌʝa.njɐwˈtah]
- hindsight, retrospection, an understanding of the significance and nature of events after they have occurred;
- perspective, unblinkeredness, the ability to see a situation from a sufficiently uninvolved position that one can understand it without distraction or bias

Etymology: Middle Boral borrowing alongside adjective janual "retrospective, backward-looking" from Scholastic Latin iānuālitās "hindsight", both derivatives of iānua "doorway, entrance" or Iānus "Janus, two-headed god of transitional spaces".
