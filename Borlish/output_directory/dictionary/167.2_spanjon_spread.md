167.2: spanjon "spread"

spanjon /spanˈʒɔn/ [spɐɲˈʝɔn]
- expansion, growth, spread, increase of size, territory or influence;
- elaboration, explanation, further description;
- extension, addition, putting more pieces or sections onto something;
- generalisation, broadening, applying something to new contexts

Etymology: noun derivation from spandr "expand, spread, broaden, explain" or directly from Latin expansio "an instance of spreading out". In either case these derive from Latin root verb pandō "spread, unfold, narrate". The metaphorical senses of expansion are partially modelled after use of the term in Scholastic Latin.
