195.4: foncçondry "agency"

foncçondry /ˌfɔn.ksɔnˈdri/ [fɔŋ.ksʊnˈdʀi]
- agency, business, establishment, an entity engaged in commerce (usually in the service industry) or the building in which it is located;
- department, office, an administrative unit of a government or its headquarters;
- (in particular, euphemistically) intelligence agency, an organisation for gathering information relevant to national security and defence

Etymology: eighteenth century, derivation via the gestalt-forming suffix -ry from noun foncçon "purpose, use". In turn this was borrowed from Latin fūnctiō "performance, execution (of a task)". The governmental sense is original; in commercial use compare similarly-formed words like vessondry "clothier" and govondry "canteen". In espionage the word is seen from the twentieth century, originally as in-house slang.
