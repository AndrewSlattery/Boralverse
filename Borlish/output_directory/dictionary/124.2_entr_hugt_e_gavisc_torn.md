124.2: entr hugt e gavisc "torn"

entr hugt e gavisc /ˈɛntr̩ hajt e gaˈvɪx/ [ˈɛn.tɐ hajt e gɐˈvɪç]
- torn, unable to decide between two (good) options;
- living it up, going from strength to strength, experiencing a continual abundance of good fortune

Etymology: idiom from the fifteenth century (Kigman), literally "between happiness and joy". The noun hugt "happiness" descends from Old Borlish huȝt, a borrowing from Old English hyht "hope"; the noun gavisc is a deverbal from gavir "enjoy, feel happy", which descends directly from Latin gaudeō "I rejoice, make merry". Used primarily with negative valence (portraying the necessary choice as an imposition) until the nineteenth century, at which the latter sense begin to be attested.
