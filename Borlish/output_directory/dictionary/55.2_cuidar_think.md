55.2: cuidar "think"

cuidar /kajˈdar/ [kɐjˈdɑː]
- think, cogitate, ponder, to consider something carefully;
- think, believe, suppose, to have an opinion about something;
- propose, intend, mean, have in mind, to fix one's mind upon something

Etymology: from Old Boral, borrowed from Old French cuidier "to consider, presume, think", which reflects the synoymous cōgitō in Latin. Displaced always-rare coiðar "to think" from the same source.
