bos "gun"

bos /bɔz/ [bɔz]
- gun, firearm, a handheld device for projecting a hard object very quickly as a ranged weapon;
- (specifically) rifle, shotgun, musket, a less portable long-barrelled gun and especially in reference to historical firearms;
- (by extension) any handheld device which is activated by a trigger and shoots or sprays objects or substances from a tube

Etymology: clipping of armbos, arm bos "boss weapon", folk-etymological borrowing (after arm "weapon") from Dutch armbósz "gun, (originally) crossbow". This is itself adapated from earlier forms such as arbalst under the influence of arm "arm (limb)", and these forms reflect Medieval Latin arbalista "crossbow".
