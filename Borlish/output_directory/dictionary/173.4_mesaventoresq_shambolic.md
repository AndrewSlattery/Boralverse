173.4: mesaventoresq "shambolic"

mesaventoresq /ˌme.zaˌvɛn.toˈrɛsk/ [ˌme.zɐˌvɛn.tʊˈʀɛsk]
- farcical, clownish, slapstick, comprising a series of ridiculous goings-on;
- shambolic, pell-mell, haphazard, with a complete lack of sensible organisation;

Etymology: nineteenth century, a blend of two preexisting words. The first is mesaventur "mishap, accident", which comprises the prefix mes- "badly" (from Germanic) and the obsolete noun aventur "event, chance"; the second is aventoresq "swashbuckling, gleefully adventurous", a borrowing via Parisian from synonymous avventoresco in Tuscan.
