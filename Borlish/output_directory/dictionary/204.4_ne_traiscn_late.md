204.4: ne traiscn "late"

ne traiscn /ne trex.n̩/ [ne ˈtʀe.xɐn]
- slow, behind, (of a timepiece) showing a time earlier than the true time;
- late, delayed, occurring after the scheduled time due to unforeseen events or inefficiencies;
- laggy, buffering, responding slowly due to high latency

Etymology: originally horological jargon used by clockmakers, attested from the seventeenth century, literally "in lag". The noun traiscn "lag, delay" is a deverbal from traiscnar "trail, drag behind, lag", which reflects a Vulgar Latin verb traxinō "I drag, pull, tug" which extends the verb trahō in Classical Latin. The word has been extended from clocks to public transportation and then to computing in the modern era.
