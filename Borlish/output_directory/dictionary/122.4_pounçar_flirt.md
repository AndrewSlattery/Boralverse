122.4: pounçar "flirt"

pounçar /punˈtsar/ [pʊnˈtsɐː]
- abrade, exfoliate, to use pumice stone to smooth or clean;
- (archaic) snog, neck, kiss, make out, to kiss passionately;
- charm, coax, flatter, to use one's words and manner to persuade or seduce someone;
- flirt, woo, to play at courtship or seduction

Etymology: originally in the first sense, a verbal derivation from pounç "pumice stone", itself via Norman from synonymous pūmex in Latin. In its archaic sense its usage mirrors others slang terms relating rubbing motions to sexual activity. By the mid-nineteenth century the term had weakened to describe flirtatious behaviour.
