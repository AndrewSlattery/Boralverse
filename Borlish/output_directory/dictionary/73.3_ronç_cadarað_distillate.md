73.3: ronç cadarað "distillate"

ronç cadarað /rɔnts ˌka.daˈraθ/ [ʀɔns ˌka.dɐˈʀah]
- distillate, the liquid that has been condensed from a vapour during distillation and thereby purified;

Etymology: phrase meaning "distilled portion", first attested in the sixteenth century. The noun ronç "portion, part, component; fraction, ratio" descends from Old Boral romnç "shard, piece broken off something", a derivation of rompre "to break". The adjective cadarað is the past participle of cadarar "to distil", a late medieval borrowing from Spanish related to Arabic قطرات <qaṭarāt> “droplets”, in reference to the process of distillation.
