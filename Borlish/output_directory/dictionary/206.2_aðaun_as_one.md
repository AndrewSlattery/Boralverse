206.2: aðaun "as one"

aðaun /aˈðon/ [ɐˈðon]
- (archaic, poetic or dialect) as one, together, at the same time or place or doing the same thing;
- (legal) in agreement, united, unanimous, without any dissent;
- in unison, in chorus, tutti, acting together in e.g. playing music or singing;
- (interjection) let's go, now, an exhortation to simultaneous action

Etymology: descendant of Old Borlish aðaun, extended variant of synonymous aun "together, at the same time". This comes either from a Late Latin phrase ad ūnum "at one" or from a deverbal of adūnō "I unite". Current in the language until the early modern period, it has fossilised in legal and musical uses; the interjection appears to have been reborrowed in the twentieth century from rural dialects that retained the term.
