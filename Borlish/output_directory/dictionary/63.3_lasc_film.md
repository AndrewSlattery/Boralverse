63.3: lasc "film"

lasc /lax/ [lax]
- film, membrane, coat, a thin layer of some substance;
- iconic [photography] film, the medium (originally ivorine [celluloid]) by which images are captured with a camera;
- film, movie, motion picture, a work of visual art in the medium of recorded moving images

Etymology: borrowed in the Middle Boral period originally in the first sense, either via Roun French lage "film" or directly from synonymous lágye in Dorstad Dutch. This is a diminutive of lágh "layer", cognate with English "low". Extension to photography took place in the nineteenth century; the word was applied first to the light-sensitive coating and then to the film as a whole.
