121.4: desbiacq "hung"

desbiacq /dɛˈsbjak/ [dɪˈzbjak]
- imbalanced, lopsided, skewed, leaning to one side or having inequal quantities in different parts;
- aslant, askew, diagonally, obliquely, turned or twisted to one side;

Etymology: early modern borrowing via French desbiaque "slanted, lopsided" from synonymous di sbiaco in an Italian language. The noun sbiaco "slant, bias tape" comprises the prefix s- and a descendant from Vulgar Latin oblaecus, variant of oblīquus "sidelong, awry; hostile". Used in a musical context since the nineteenth century; in the last sense (lately often clipped to biacq) it is seen from approximately the same time.
