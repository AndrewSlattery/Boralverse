70.2: haubrjoranç "advertising"

haubrjoranç /ˌho.br̩.ʒoˈrants/ [ˌho.bɐ.ʝʊˈʀans]
- advertising, publicising, promotion, marketing, communication whose purpose is to inform or influence customers about products or services;
- advertisement, commercial, ad, spot, an instance of advertising something

Etymology: seventeenth-century coinage from verb haubrjorar "to announce, to herald, to make public", itself a derivation from noun haubrjour "herald, town crier, one whose job is to announce things publicly". This had shifted from the sense "scout, sentry, lookout; omen, advance warning", in which form it was borrowed from Old French herbergeor "one sent ahead (of a military camp)".
