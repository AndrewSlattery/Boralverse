32.3: oblimanç "passion"

oblimanç /ˌo.bliˈmants/ [ˌo.blɪˈmans]
- desire, craving, longing, strong attraction towards something or the condition of wanting something deeply;
- passion, enthusiasm, zeal, fervour, a powerful emotion or excitement in the pursuit of some end goal;

Etymology: nominal derviation from oblimar "to desire, crave", from synonymous Medieval Latin oblīmō (or directly from a Latin noun oblīmantia, though there is no record of this derivation in Latin until the fifteenth century). This verb is formed from the intensive prefix ob- and the verb līmō "I am eager for, I lust after".

In turn, līmō and the related noun līmus reflect a relatinisation of Old Boral lim "lust" (now archaic outside the expression lim aïr "be eager"), which must be a descendant of synonymous Latin libīdō (accusative libīdinem; compare the outcome of Latin -tūdinem as -tum in e.g. soltum "solitude", presumably via an intermediary -tūmine).
