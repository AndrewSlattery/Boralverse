94.6: cigl "boyfriend, girlfriend"

cigl /tsajl/ [tsajl]
- boyfriend, girlfriend, significant other, partner, one member of an unmarried romantic and/or sexual relationship;
- darling, dear, honey, baby, a generic term of endearment for one's lover

Etymology: from Old Borlish cigle /tsiɣlə ~ tsiʎə/ "trinket, tchotchke, proverbially worthless object", from synonymous *cīculus in Vulgar Latin. This is a diminutive from Latin cīccum "trinket", from an Ancient Greek form κίκκος which is probably imitative. Semantic drift to the modern sense (via the term of address) is evidenced from the eighteenth century.
