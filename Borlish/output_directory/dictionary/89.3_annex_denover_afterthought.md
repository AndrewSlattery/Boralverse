89.3: annex denover "afterthought"

annex denover /aˈnɛks ˌde.noˈvɛr/ [ɐˈnɛks ˌde.nʊˈvɛː]
- afterthought, an action or reflection done after the fact;
- something done at the last-minute or in an improvised manner, like a correction, addition or improvement

Etymology: idiom attested from the nineteenth century, literally "final-stage addition". The noun annex "supplement, appendix, addition, boost, enhancement, refinement" is a deverbal from verb annexar "to supplement, append, boost, refine", which comes via Scholastic Latin annexō from Classical annexus "attachment".

The adjective denover is a contemporary derivation from denou "conclusion, ending, denouement; the final stage of any process", itself also a deverbal from denovar "untie, unravel; end". This is an Old Borlish derivation from nou "know, tangle", from the synonymous nōdus in Latin.
