92.2: scagl a natur "the way of things"

scagl a natur /xɛil a naˈtɪr/ [çɛil a nɐˈtɪː]
- convention, the way of things, elements of society or the wider world considered innate and unchangeable;
- hierarchy, pecking order, a social economic or political system in which people or things are ranked and given corresponding status

Etymology: literally "nature's staircase", derived in the Middle Boral period from the Scholastic Latin scāla nātūrae "the Great Chain of Being" (literally, the ladder of nature). This is the theological concept of the hierarchy of all matter and life, thought by medieval Christianity to have been decreed by God, and adapted from similar ideas in Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy.

Often in the phrase step ny scagl a natur "part of the natural order of things, one's place in a hierarchy", where step "step, rung, foothold" is a borrowing from Old English.
