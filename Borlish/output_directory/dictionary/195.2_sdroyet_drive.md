195.2: sdroyet "drive"

sdroyet /sdrɔˈjɛt/ [zdʀʊˈʝɛt]
- (archaic, historical) étui, toolbox, a miniature (often ornamental) case for holding small items like needles or other utilitarian things;
- drive, card, a device for storing digital data;

Etymology: diminutive of noun sdroy "depot, warehouse, stockpile", first attested in Middle Borlish isdroȝ "freight, goods transported by water". This was borrowed via synoymous zdruog in contemporary Saxon, likely from Polish zdroi "spring, small stream; origin, source". The historical and modern senses are presumed to be independent derivations; the latter first appears over a century after the former became practically obsolete.
