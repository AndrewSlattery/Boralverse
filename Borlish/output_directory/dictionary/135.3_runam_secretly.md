135.3: runam "secretly"

runam /riˈnam/ [ʀɪˈnam]
- secretly, in secret, covertly, on the QT, not letting anyone else know about something;
- privately, in private, sub rosa, behind closed doors, in a setting conducive to secrecy

Etymology: from Middle Borlish runam "by magic, using sorcery; in secret, hidden from view" (the semantic shift mirroring that of "occult"). This is a derivative of contemporary run "symbol, spell, talisman" using the now-unproductive adverbial suffix -am, descending from Latin anima "soul" (compare kireðam "wholeheartedly", coram "in person").
