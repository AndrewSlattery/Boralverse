119.2: sleut "politician"

sleut /slawt/ [zlawt]
- politician, representative, someone engaged in politics as an elected or appointed official;
- smooth talker, sycophant, silver tongue, someone skilled in charming people or especially in keeping the peace

Etymology: substantive use of the past participle of verb sleir "to elect, to vote for", itself via Old Borlish isler "elect" from Vulgar Latin exligō (Classical ēligō "I pick, choose, elect"). The term was used almost immediately as a somewhat derogatory term for anyone perceived to act in the manner of a politician.
