152.2: præmiar "reward"

præmiar /preˈmjar/ [pʀɪˈmjɐː]
- reward, recompense, honour, to recognise (some achievement) and give some boon for it;
- incentivise, encourage, motivate, to incite (an action) by giving something as a reward for doing it

Etymology: borrowed from Scholastic Latin præmiō "I reward, honour", a verbal derivative from præmium "profit, prize, bribe". Though the verb was once poetically used with the person rewarded as the direct object, now only the honourable act itself may take that position.
