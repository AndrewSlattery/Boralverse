190.2: barrougl "wheelbarrow"

barrougl /baˈrujl/ [bɐˈʀʊjl]
- wheelbarrow, handcart, a small one-wheeled cart with handles used for transporting small loads;
- trolley, cart, a conveyance for carrying groceries or other items around a shop;
- buggy, pram, stroller, a small carriage in which an infant or toddler sits or lies and is pushed around

Etymology: via Old Borlish beroȝl "handcart, trolley" from synonymous birocla in Vulgar Latin. This reflects birotula, a diminutive from late Latin birota "two-wheeled cart" which comes from bi- "double" and rota "wheel". Compare Tuscan baroccio and Old French beroue, brouette, both meaning "cart". The term was likely influenced by the unrelated Old English bearwe "basket, handcart". In more general use the term is comparatively recent, only seen from the late ninteenth century.
