101.4: appragl phasm "television set"

appragl phasm /aˈprɛjl ˈfazm̩/ [ɐˈpʀɛjl ˈfa.zɐm]
- television set, an electronic device that receives and displays TV signals

Etymology: twentieth-century collocation, from appragl "device, machine, tool" and phasm "(the technology of) television, image transmission". The first component descends from Medieval Latin apparāculum "tools, equipment", a derivation of apparō "I prepare, equip". The second is a learned borrowing directly from Ancient Greek φάσμα • (phásma) "apparition, phantom, image".
