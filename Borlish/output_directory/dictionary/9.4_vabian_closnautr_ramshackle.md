9.4: vabian closnautr "ramshackle"

vabian closnautr /vaˈbjan kloˈsno.tr̩/ [vɐˈbjan klʊˈzno.tɐ]
- dilapidated, tumbledown, ramshackle, in a deplorable state lacking maintenance and upkeep;
- obsolete, deprecated, antiquated, no longer in use or neglected in favour of something newer;
- void, null, invalid, no longer having any effect or now being considered irrelevant

Etymology: compound of the two Middle Boral words vabȝan "woebegone, in a sorry state" and closnautre "beset, hagridden, burdened", originally both in reference to people. The former is borrowed from Old English wābegān "beset by woe", while the latter descends (it is thought, via some vulgar adverbial form) from Latin clausus "enclosed, shut off, inaccessible".

The shift from referring to people towards referring to buildings or vehicles (and later in extended use as above) took place slowly in the Revitalist and Romantic periods and was complete by the turn of the eighteenth century; in modern usage, if the word refers to a person it references their outdated fashions, affect or beliefs and not their emotional state.
