109.2: duvar "cheat"

duvar /diˈvar/ [dɪˈvɐː]
- cheat, connive, to violate the rules (of a game) in order to attempt to gain an advantage;
- sidestep, dodge, evade, duck, to get out of the way so that something cannot hit (or metaphorically, negatively affect) you;

Etymology: direct descendant of Old Borlish duvar, dufar "to duck, dip, lower oneself; to plunge into water", which was borrowed from Old English dyfan "to dive, submerse". In its ludic sense it is attested from the seventeenth century.
