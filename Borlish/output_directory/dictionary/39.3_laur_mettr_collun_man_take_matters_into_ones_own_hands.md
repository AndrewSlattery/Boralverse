39.3: laur mettr coll'un man "take matters into one's own hands"

laur mettr coll'un man /lor ˈmɛtr̩ kɔˈlɪn man/ [loː ˈmɛ.tɐ kʊˈlɪmˌman]
- take matters into one's own hands, to deal with a problem alone especially if due to others responsible having failed to tackle it;
- shoulder responsibility, to accept that one is responsible for something bad or difficult;
- (more generally) get to work, to start doing a (usually lengthy or otherwise-challenging) job;
- (jocular or self-effacing) masturbate, to stimulate oneself with the hands

Etymology: Idiom in use since the Middle Boral period, literally "to put work with the one hand". It is an extension of preexisting laur mettr "to tackle an issue, to take a job", from now-rare laur "work" < Latin labor (or a deverbal from laurar "to work") and mettr "to put" < Latin mittō "I send". In the last sense, first attested in writing in 1883 (possibly; more certain usages by the early c20), via a lewd reinterpretation of the literal sense of the idiom.
