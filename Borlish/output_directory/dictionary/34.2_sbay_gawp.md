34.2: sbay "gawp"

sbay /sbe/ [zbe]
- open-mouthed expression, the act of gawping at something or someone either in stupefaction or intrusive fascination

Etymology: deverbal derivation from sbayar "to gape, gawp" via Old Boral from Medieval Latin exbadō "I gape, open wide". The somewhat pejorative sense in Modern Boral is likely due to interference from the circumfix s- -ar (as in sboccar "to smirk"). The Latin is a derivative of synonymous badō, which is of unclear (possibly onomatopoeic) origin.
