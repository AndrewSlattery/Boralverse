50.6: 17th Lexember

alcheðr "once more"

alcheðr /alˈke.ðr̩/ [ɐˈgɛ.ðɐ]
- once more, anew, afresh, occurring again after a period of absence or otherwise with a definite break from the past;
- (obsolete) twice, occuring two times

Etymology: Middle Boral extension of now-obsolete eðr "again, twice, repeatedly" after various function words like alcant "once", alcun "none" and alcot "how much". The element alc- descends from Latin determiner aliquī "some, any", while the adverb eðr is either a direct reflection of Latin iterum "again, a second time" or a deverbal of eðrar "to repeat", from related Latin iterō "I repeat, I do again".
