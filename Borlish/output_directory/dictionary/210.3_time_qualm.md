210.3: time "qualm"

time /tiˈme/ [tɪˈme]
- qualm, misgiving, reservation, scruple, doubt, a feeling of unease or uncertainty regarding a course of action;
- timidity, shyness, diffidence, self-effacement, a lack of courage or confidence; 
- con, disadvantage, drawback, a weakness or undesirable feature of something

Etymology: derived from earlier adjective time "doubtful; shy, timid", a borrowing from Scholastic Latin timeus "frightened, cowrdly". This comes from the root verb timeō "I fear, I am afraid". The word is seen as a noun from the seventeenth century, and as a disadvantageous quality of something (as opposed to something felt by a person) since the mid-nineteenth century.
