garaf /gaˈraf/ [gɐˈʀaf]
- grip, friction, purchase, the state of being able to hold onto something without slipping;

Etymology: from Middle Boral garaf "grip, handle", a borrowing from Portingale garafa "handle", of indeterminate origin. Either an alteration of earlier grafio, garfio "hook", from Latin graphium "stylus, pen", or else borrowed from Andalus Arabic جَارْفَا‎ (gárfá) "handful, claw".
