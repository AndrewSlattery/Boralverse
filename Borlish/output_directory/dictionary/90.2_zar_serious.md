Etymology: from sixteenth-century zar "risky, high-stakes", transferred from the name of a gambling dice game. This comes via Napolitan zara from Arabic زَهْر (zahr) "dice". Doublet of hasart "peril, danger", which comes via French. Used exclusively of games and competitions until the nineteenth century, when the idiom with cair is first attested.
