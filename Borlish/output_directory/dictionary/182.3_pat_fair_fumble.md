182.3: pat fair "fumble"

pat fair /pat fer/ [pat feː]
- fumble, paw, to handle with clumsy hands;
- bungle, botch, mishandle, to deal with (a situation) poorly;

Etymology: idiomatic phrase attested from the fifteenth century, literally "to do paws" in reference to the unsuitability of many animal's paws for holding things. The noun pat "paw; (colloq.) hand, foot" descends from Vulgar Latin patta "paw", a borrowing from Frankish related to English "pad". In metaphorical use the phrase is seen from the seventeenth century.
