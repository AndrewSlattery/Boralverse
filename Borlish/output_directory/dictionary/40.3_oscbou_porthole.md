40.3: oscbou "porthole"

oscbou /oxˈbu/
- porthole, gunport, a window set into the hull of a ship for cannons to fire through (or in modern use simply for the view);
- hatch, an (often internal) opening in a wall for people to pass things such as prepared food through

Etymology: Middle Boral borrowing from contemporary Vascon ox (de) buy /ɔʃ de bwi/ "gunport", literally "ox's eye". The word ox "eye" descends from Latin oculus and is cognate with Boral ogl /ɔjl/, while the word buy "ox" was adapted to the Boral bou "ox", both from Latin bōs, bovem "cow".
