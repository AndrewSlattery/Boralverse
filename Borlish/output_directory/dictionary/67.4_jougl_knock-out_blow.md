Etymology: from Middle Boral jougl "death blow, killing strike", deverbal from joglar "to slay, to decisively kill, esp. to slit the throat of". This descends via synonymous Old Boral ioȝlar from Latin iugulō, verb derivative from iugulum "collarbone, throat; fig. a murder". Less-fatal use appears first in the context of prize-fighting.
