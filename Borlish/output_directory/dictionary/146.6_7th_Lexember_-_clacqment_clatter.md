Etymology: noun formation from clacquar "rattle, clatter, cause a disturbance". This was borrowed in the Middle Borlish period from contemporary French clacquer "clap, slap, slam", or directly from that word's Germanic origin (compare Willem or Kentish clacken "whack, shake"). Used for gunfire since the eighteenth century, and for general disruption from the nineteenth.
