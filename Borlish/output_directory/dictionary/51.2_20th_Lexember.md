cingr "hail"

cingr /ˈtsɪn.gr̩/ [ˈtsɪŋ.gɐ]
- hail, the phenomenon of precipitation in the form of frozen raindrops;
- hailstone, any single particle of this precipitation;
- (by extension) ball bearing, a small metal sphere used in mechanical components or (commonly) any similar-looking ball;

Etymology: from the late Old Boral period originally restricted to naval usage, from Vask chingor "hail, hailstones". In the last sense it is a clipping of cingr acier "steel hailstone", apparently a direct calque from Cambrick deurkeseir "ball bearing".
