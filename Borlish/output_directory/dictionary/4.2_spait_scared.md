4.2: spait "scared"

spait /spet/
- afraid, scared, frightened, feeling fear or apprehension about something;
- shy, timid, nervous, lacking in courage or confidence
- cautious, tentative, (of a person) restrained and not being assertive, (of a result) uncertain and subject to future change

Etymology: past participle of verb spagir "to frighten, to scare", itself descending unmolested from Latin expaveō "I am very afraid, I am terrified of"—although the meaning has tempered significantly over time. Extension to lack of confidence in oneself and lack of certainty in results is in evidence by the later Middle Boral period in the sixteenth century.
