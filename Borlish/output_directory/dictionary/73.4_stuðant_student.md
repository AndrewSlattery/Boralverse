73.4: stuðant "student"

stuðant /stiˈðant/ [stɪˈðan(t)]
- student, pupil, a person enrolled in an academic institution;
- disciple, devotee, enthusiast, someone who actively follows or admires a philosophy or similar construct;

Etymology: Old Boral stuðant "student", present participle of stuðar "excel, shine, be skilled; learn, practice, improve, train" influenced by Latin studēns "dedicating oneself to, studying". The verb stuðar is a derivative of stuð "clever, intelligent, skilled; interested, engaged, paying attention" (now obsolete outside of fixed expressions), from Latin ā̆stūtus "crafty, cunning, tricksy", and was quickly conflated with shortlived semi-learnèd studiar "to study (in the Church)", from post-Classical Latin studiō "I study" (compare earlier synonymous studeō).
