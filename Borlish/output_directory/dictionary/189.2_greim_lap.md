189.2: greim "lap"

greim /grim/ [gʀim]
- lap, the upper legs of a seated person;
- skirt, apron, the part of a garment that covers this part of the body;
- bosom, embrace, affection, care, the figurative position of being nurtured or protected by someone

Etymology: direct descendant via Old Borlish from Latin gremium "lap; bosom; embrace". The term has been used in tailoring from the thirteenth century. The metaphorical sense may continue the similar usage in Latin, but is more likely to be an independent innovation of the early modern period.
