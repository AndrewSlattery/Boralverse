200.3: Lexember 2025 - 17: govey "set"

govey /goˈvi/ [gʊˈvi]
- brood, covey, a group of game birds such as pheasants or grouse;
- clutch, a group of eggs in a nest;
- litter, a group of newborn animals or (loosely or jocularly) children;
- set, society, circle, acquaintance, a group of persons associated by status or interest (often with mildly deprecatory force)

Etymology: Middle Borlish, borrowed from contemporary Kentish or Norman covey, govee "brood". This is a substantivisation of the past participle of cover "to brood (an egg)", the regular descendant of Latin cubō "I lie down; I incubate" (from whose present tense Borlish cair "to fall" takes its suppletive past tense forms). Extension from venery to other groups of animals is seen from the seventeenth century, and to groups of people from the nineteenth.
