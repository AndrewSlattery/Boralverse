4.4: belem "scene"

belem /beˈlɛm/ [biˈlɛm]
- scene, scenery, décor, setting in which something occurs or circumstances in which a narrative (especially a play or film) takes place
- scene, discrete part of a story taking place over continuous time
- diorama, tableau, mural, model or staged version of an event or location
- (specifically) the Nativity scene, a representation of the birth of the Christchild with figurines

Etymology: borrowed in the last sense from Portingale or Leon belèm "crib, Nativity scene" in the Middle Boral period; this is a metonymic usage of proper noun Belèm "Bethlehem", from Hebrew via Latin Bethlehēmum. The word's extension to more general contexts is mostly particular to Boral, although the "diorama" sense is more widely seen.
