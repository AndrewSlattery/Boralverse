53.4: aversion "opposition"

aversion /ˌa.vɛrˈzjɔn/ [ˌa.vɪːˈzjɔn]
- opposition, resistance, pushback, dissent, the state of being in disagreement with someone's actions;
- discontent, disgruntlement, dissatisfaction, resentment, feelings of unhappiness with the status quo;
- resistance, rebellion, uprising, revolt, organisation struggling for liberation against an authority seen as illegitimate (especially when underground or otherwise cloak-and-dagger)

Etymology: from Middle Boral aversion "opposition, resistance", seemingly the confluence of the two Latin roots āvertō "I turn away, repulse" and non-classical advertō "I oppose, fight against" (a backformation from adversārius "opponent"). In the last sense used especially for Collusion-supported movements through the twentieth century in regions dominated by Ubiquitous administration.
