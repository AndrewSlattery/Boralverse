122.2: lastumnesc "haggard"

lastumnesc /ˌla.stɪmˈnɛx/ [ˌla.stɪmˈnɛç]
- haggard, drawn, stressed, appearing unwell or worried;
- weary, exhausted, tired, suffering from a lack of sleep;
- dilapidated, ramshackle, bedraggled, in poor condition

Etymology: fifteenth century, adjectival derivation from noun lastumn "exhaustion, weariness, stress". This is either a secondary derivation in the Old Borlish period from adjective las "tired, faint, spent" from synonymous lassus in Latin, or else a direct descendant of the Latin noun lassitūdō "faintness, weariness". In its use for things other than people the word is attested from the eighteenth century.
