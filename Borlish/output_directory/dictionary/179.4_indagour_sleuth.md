179.4: indagour "sleuth"

indagour /ˌɪn.daˈgur/ [ˌɪn.dɐˈgʊː]
- investigator, detective, sleuth, a person employed to discover things that are unknown or hidden;
- tracker, tracer, a person or tool that keeps an eye on where someone or something is;
- analyser, scanner, any tool that extracts information from a source

Etymology: agentive derivation from verb indagar "track, investigate, scan, analyse", which is a sixteenth-century borrowing from Latin indāgō "I track, trace; I investigate". The word was used only for people until the late nineteenth century, when the word was extended to various devices able to autonomously track or analyse things.
