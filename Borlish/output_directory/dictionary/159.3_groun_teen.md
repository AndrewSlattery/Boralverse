159.3: groun "teen"

groun /grun/ [gʀun]
- a member of a countercultural and rowdy youth movement in the latter days of the Drengot Collusion;
- (colloquial) teen, teenager, adolescent, youth, a young person in the years around the age of majority;
- rascal, hooligan, brat, scamp, rebel, an rowdy and usually immature person;
- roughcut, sketch, work-in-progress, stub, an incomplete item or piece of work;
- beta, mock-up, prototype, an early version of something

Etymology: borrowed with the first sense in the mid-twentieth century from Willem Dutch gróng "adolescence; unruly young person", cognate with growing in English. Applied to all youths of a similar age since the 1970s, the word quickly also became a mild insult describing stereotypical teen behaviours. In the final senses it is only attested in the last twenty years.
