5.4: frigsar "to fry"

frigsar /frajˈzar/ [fʀɐjˈzɑː]
- to fry, to cook food in a pan with oil or similar fat
- to aggravate, provoke, incite, to cause someone or a group of people to become angry or outraged

Etymology: first attested in early Modern Boral, apparently a backformation from noun frigsoir "frying pan" and replacing earlier verb frigr < Latin frīgō "I roast, fry, parch". The noun is an Old Boral derivation with the tool suffix -oir, modelled on the past participle friȝs < Insular Latin frīxus "roasted, fried". Use of the verb in the sense "aggravate" is first seen in the nineteenth century.
