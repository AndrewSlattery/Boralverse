100.2: aujon "magazine"

aujon /oˈʒɔn/ [ʊˈʝɔn]
- magazine, periodical, a non-academic publication comprising folded sheets attached together;
- assemblage, parade, display, gathering, a collection of people of things to be looked at;
- (military) muster, a gathering of troops for the purposes of inspection (or display, exercise, induction, etc.)

Etymology: originally in the last sense, a Middle Borlish adaptation of Medieval Latin ausiō "mobilisation, deployment, the readying of troops for battle". This is a noun from audeō "I dare, venture, risk"; the meaning passed via "(risky) manoeuvre, the act of putting (oneself or troops) in harm's way". Use outside of a military context is attested from the seventeenth century; in the (now most common) first sense it is attested from the early nineteenth.
