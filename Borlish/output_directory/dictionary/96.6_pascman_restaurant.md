96.6: pascman "restaurant"

pascman /paxˈman/ [pɐxˈman]
- restaurant, eatery, diner, an establishment where people are served food;
- restaurateur, the owner of such an establishment

Etymology: from Middle Borlish (re)pascman "eatery", derivative of repasc "meal" with the vendor suffix -man < Old Borlish manc/ç "shop, vendor". The noun repasc reflects a Late Latin repāscō "I make food, cater", from Classical pāscō "I graze, feast".
