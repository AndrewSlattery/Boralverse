86.4: bougr "fellow"

bougr /ˈbu.gr̩/ [ˈbu.gɐ]
- fellow, chap, cove, bloke, guy, a man and especially an ordinary man of the street;
- (archaic) scoundrel, rogue, cad, blackguard, someone (usually a man) without honour or virtue

Etymology: only recently (early twentieth century) ameliorated from an insult, via Middle Boral bougr "villain, criminal, enemy; pagan, apostate, non-believer" from Old Boral bougre "heretic, evildoer". This reflects Medieval Latin Bulgarus "from Bulgaria", from Old Slavonic, and was probably introduced via contemporary French legal codes.
