7.3: vorpal "diced"

vorpal /vɔrˈpal/ [vʊːˈpaw]
- diced, cut into small cubes as a preparation in cooking;
- cubic, boxy, having the shape of a cube
- (of lodgings) cramped, not spacious, uncomfortably restricted in size or space
- pixellated, blocky, of disappointingly low resolution

Etymology: originally in the culinary sense, a borrowing in the late eighteenth century from Normal vourpel "diced", itself from Saxon wurpel "die, cube". This is a native word descending from Classical German vurpilas "die" (compare Bavarn würfil with the same meaning).

To refer to housing it is attested since the nineteenth century, at around the same time as the use for imagery—in that sense, it is an 1821 calque from Provincial icon dau "die image" used to criticise the newly unveiled Steeplepost Tapestry in Ambrosia.
