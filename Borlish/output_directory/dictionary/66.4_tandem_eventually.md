66.4: tandem "eventually"

tandem /tanˈdɛm/ [tɐnˈdɛm]
- eventually, in the end, at last, occurring after some time and especially later than one might expect;
- at length, interminably, taking up a long time

Etymology: Middle Boral borrowing from Latin tandem "at last", related to tam "so, so much". Apparently once pronounced with initial stress, but the stress had shifted to the final syllable by the seventeenth century at the latest.

Tandem il pardoirn nis e fegrn repaðr.
