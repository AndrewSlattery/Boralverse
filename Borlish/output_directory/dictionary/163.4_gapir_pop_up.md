163.4: gapir "pop up"

gapir /gaˈpɪr/ [gɐˈpɪː]
- happen intermittently, to occur at unpredictable intervals;
- pop up, crop up, to appear (multiple times) without warning;
- be flaky, shilly-shally, to behave unpredictably or unreliably

Etymology: verbal derivative from gap "patch", apparently borrowed in the Middle Borlish period from Welsh gap "hole; patch, a distinct section of some larger whole". This in turn was taken from Old Norse gap "empty space, gap, chasm", deverbal from gapa "to gape, be open wide".
