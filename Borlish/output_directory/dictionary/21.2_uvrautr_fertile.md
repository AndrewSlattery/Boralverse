21.2: uvrautr "fertile"

uvrautr /iˈvro.tr̩/ [ɪˈvʀotɐ]
- fertile, fruitful, fecund, bearing a bounteous harvest or by extension producing anything in abundance;
- verdant, lush, characterised by the presence of a profusion of vegetation;
- idyllic, bucolic, pastoral, reminiscent of an idealised version of the countryside

Etymology: from Old Boral uvrautre /yˈvraw.təɾ/ "(of land) fertile", extended variant of synonymous uvre via suffixing -autre, an adjectival ending of dubious origin (often simply presented as reflecting Latin adverbial ending -āliter, but this presents issues). The earlier uvre descends directly from Latin ūber "productive, full, rich" and is still in agricultural use in some modern rural dialects.
