172.2: allocquar "address"

allocquar /ˌa.lɔˈkwar/ [ˌa.lʊˈkwɐː]
- address, speak to, to communicate with by means of speech;
- affect, touch, impact, to have some sort of relevance to or effect upon;
- (dated) court, woo, romance, to endeavour to gain someone's affections

Etymology: Middle Borlish, borrowed (with regularised conjugation modelled after collocquar "converse") from Latin alloquor "I address, greet", derived from the root loquor "I speak". The term is seen in metaphorical use from the eighteenth century, and in romantic contexts from around the same time.
