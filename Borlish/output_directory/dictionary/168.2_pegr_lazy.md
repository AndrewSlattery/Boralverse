pegr /pijr̩/ [ˈpi.ʝɐ]
- idle, inactive, motionless, not engaged in any activity;

Etymology: from Old Borlish peȝr "unintelligent; idle; lazy", a semi-learned descendant of Latin piger "dull, lazy, sluggish; loth, averse". Use of physical appearance is attested from the sixteenth century; in the latter more general senses the word is seen from the early nineteenth century.
