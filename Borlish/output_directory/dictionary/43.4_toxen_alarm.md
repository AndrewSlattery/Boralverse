43.4: toxen "alarm"

toxen /tɔkˈsɛn/ [tʊgˈzɛn]
- alarm, klaxon, a sound intended to give notice of approaching danger or an upcoming deadline;
- (more genereally) warning, alert, signal, any means of informing someone of a new (especially a problematic) development

Etymology: early Middle Boral borrowing from Old French tocsin, tocseing etc. "alarm, ringing of a bell" (originally in a military context), itself from Old Vascon toca-segn "alarm", literally "strikes (a) bell". These reflect respectively Vulgar Latin toccāre "to touch" and Latin signum "signal, mark".
