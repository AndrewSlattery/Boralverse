laundar "slip"

laundar /lonˈdar/ [lʊnˈdɑː]
- slip, skid, slide, glide, to move along a slippery surface without traction;
- trip, stumble, stagger, to walk clumsily so as to (almost) fall over;
- err, misspeak, misstep, to be mistaken about something;
- pass, elapse, (of time) to be spent, especially without one achieving anything of import

Etymology: from Old Boral laundar "slip, err", either from an unattested synonymous Latin verb *lābundō or a contemporary verbal derivation of laund "slippery, unsteady" (the modern launt "slip, misstep, faux pas" is likely a later deverbal from the Middle Boral period). In either case the word originates with Latin lābundus "slippery", participial form of deponent verb lābor "I slip, sink, vanish, err".
