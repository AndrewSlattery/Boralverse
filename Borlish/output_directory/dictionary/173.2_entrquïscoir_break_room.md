173.2: entrquïscoir "break room"

entrquïscoir /ˌɛntr̩ˌkwajiˈxɔir/ [ˌɛn.tɐˌkwajˈxɔ.jɐ]
- break room, a space in a workspace set aside for staff to spend short periods away from work to e.g. eat or talk;
- (metaphorically) respite, a brief interval of rest or relief between times of some unpleasant experience

Etymology: mid-twentieth century, place derivation (using the suffix -oir < -ōrium in Medieval Latin) from the verb entrquïr "pause, stop work". This is a late medieval borrowing from Latin interquiēscō "I rest briefly", adapted to native prefix entr- "between" and verb quïr "to put out, turn off".
