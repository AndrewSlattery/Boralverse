48.3: pernix "nimble"

pernix /pɛrˈnɪks/ [pɪːˈnɪks]
- nimble, dextrous, deft, agile, skillful with one's hands and able to make very precise movements;
- swift, fleet, rapid and graceful in motion;
- subtle, crafty, insidious, manipulative, being able to direct someone else's decisions without their knowledge

Etymology: learned borrowing in the Middle Boral period from Latin pernix "nimble, agile, swift", thought to be connected with perna "ham, haunch, gammon" (cf. inherited Boral parn "bacon"), although the expected Latin form would be *pernāx.

Its latter sense develops in the eighteenth century under the malign influence of unrelated perniçous "harmful, pernicious, deleterious", from synonymous Latin perniciōsus, a derivative of pernecō "I kill, slay, annihilate".
