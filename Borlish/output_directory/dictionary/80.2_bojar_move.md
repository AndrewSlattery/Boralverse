80.2: bojar "move"

bojar /boˈʒar/ [bʊˈʝɑː]
- move, shift, bump, budge, to cause to be displaced from a position;
- dislodge, free, extricate, to remove from a position in which something was firmly set
- reconsider, to change one's mind

Etymology: from Old Boral bojar "move, shift", originally in both intransitive (it moved) and transitive (I moved it) use but by the Middle Boral period only in the latter. This is a borrowing from synonymous Old French bougier, from Vulgar Latin bullicō "I boil, bubble up", a frequentative from bulliō (whence Borlish boglir "to boil").
