81.4: vis "in fact"

vis /vɪz/ [vɪz]

    evidently, of course, manifestly, as you know, used to introduce information which one feels is sufficiently obvious that it should have come up by now;
    in fact, actually, in reality, indeed, used to introduce a statement which corrects some part of a previous understanding;
    it transpires, it turns out, apparently, used to introduce surprising new information

Etymology: extracted in the late Middle Boral period from expressions like vis es… "it is seen that…", as the past participle of veir "to see" < Latin videō "I see". Speculation that it is instead a retention of Old Boral ivis "sure, certain", a borrowing from synonymous Old English gewiss, is unsupported by any intermediate attestations (though cf modern Merch awice /əˈwəis/ "indeed, yes").

The word is often found in the collocation Or vis… "Well, actually…", especially when it is used at the start of sentences.
