46.2: bro "dude"

bro /bro/ [bʀo]
- (vocative) dude, bro, mate, term of address for a (usually male) friend used generally in an admiring or appreciative context;
- macho, jocky, masculine (person), a person typified by the impression of physical strength and other male-associated characteristics

Etymology: often conflated with synonymous Willem broe or Merch brow /bru/ (both clippings of words for "brother") and likely influenced in usage by these, but thought to be otherwise unrelated. In the Middle Boral period we primarily see the spelling brau "hero, worthy man", suggesting a connection to braf "brave, heroic" from Italian via French.

Early and uncertain attestions of a word ?prau "poss. fighter, warrior" constitute an alternative etymology; this word may reflect the Latin adjective pravus "perverse, vicious", although the semantic connection is tenuous.
