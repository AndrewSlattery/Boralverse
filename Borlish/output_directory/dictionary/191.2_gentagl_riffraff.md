191.2: gentagl "riffraff"

gentagl /ʒɛnˈtɛjl/ [ʝɪnˈtɛjl]
- populace, population, inhabitants, demos, the people of a region (especially of a nation or polity);
- masses, rabble, riffraff, hoi polloi, the common people as opposed to the elite (often with pejorative affect)

Etymology: Middle Borlish derivative of gent "people, nation" and -agl, an unproductive instrumental or collective suffix. The noun descends straightforwardly from Latin gēns "clan, tribe, people"; the affix from Latin thematic vowel -ā- and suffix -cula "tool, instrument". Attestatations of gentācula (with a first-declension variant of the suffix) "common people" in Scholastic Latin are likely modelled after the vernacular Romance forms.
