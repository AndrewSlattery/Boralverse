206.3: çondr "pendant"

çondr /ˈtsɔn.dr̩/ [ˈtsɔn.dɐ]
- pendant, a piece of jewellery which hangs down as an ornament (as attached to a necklace or earring);
- locket, such an ornament which can be opened to store some item of sentimental value;
- charm, amulet, bead, medallion, trinket, a small item attached to e.g. a bracelet especially as having notional protective properties

Etymology: Middle Borlish, via contemporary French from Tuscan ciondolo "pendant, charm". This is a deverbal from ciondolare "dangle, swing", which is thought to reflect a Vulgar Latin exundulō "I sway", from unda "wave". The Borlish term has broadened to cheaper and less precious ornaments than its cognates in other languages.
