102.3: brag "underpants"

brag /brɛj/ [bʀɛj]
- underpants, pants, undies, knickers, drawers, a short garment worn next to the skin and going ho higher than the navel
- (historical) breeches, trousers, a tightfitting garment covering the hips and legs

Etymology: original in the latter sense and in more general use, via Old Borlish braȝ from Latin brācae "breeches", from Gaulish. Used primarily for underwear since the late nineteenth century, in which sense it is clipped from now-archaic soubrag "underpants".
