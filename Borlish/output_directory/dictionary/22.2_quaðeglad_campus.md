22.2: quaðeglad "campus"

quaðeglad /ˌkwa.ðijˈlad/
- complex, campus, base, a collection of buildings with a common purpose such as a university or military base;
- plant, works, estate, a collection of industrial warehouses or similar buildings in one area

Etymology: early modern-era borrowing from Welsh qυaðellad /kvaˈðiʎad/ "university campus, military base", a Middle Welsh compound of qυ-/kyv- "with, together" and aðellad "building, edifice, structure". This in turn is a noun derivation from aðello "to build, construct", from ello "to create, make, compose, put together".
