70.4: nacleu n'oc ort "looking up"

nacleu n'oc ort /naˈklaw nɔk ɔrt/ [nɐˈklaw nuˈgɔːt]
- looking up, optimistic, on the up, having good prospects and feeling positively abot one's near future

Etymology: idiom first attested in Manuel Kigman's poetry of the fifteenth century, literally "sloping in the ascent". The noun ort "lift, rise, ascent" directly reflects Latin ortus "risen, originated, appeared" (and given the lack of early attestations it may be a reborrowing), while nacleu is from Latin acclīvis "steep".
