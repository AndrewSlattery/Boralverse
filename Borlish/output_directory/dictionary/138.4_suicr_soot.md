suicr /ˈsai.kr̩/ [ˈsai.kɐ]
- soot, lampblack, particles of carbon and tar produced by incomplete combustion;
- blot, blemish, flaw, a mark of imperfection in or on a surface;

Etymology: via Old Borlish sui, suicle "soot" from synonymous sūdia, sūdicula in Insular Latin (compare French suie, Welsh huðygl, both meaning "soot"). In the more general uses the word is attested from the fifteenth century; the botanical senses date in writing to the seventeenth.
