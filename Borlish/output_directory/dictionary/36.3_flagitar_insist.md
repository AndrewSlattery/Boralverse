36.3: flagitar "insist"

flagitar /ˌfla.ʒiˈtar/ [ˌfla.ʝɪˈtɑː]
- insist, demand, ask continually and forcefully that something be done;
- insist, affirm, to hold up a claim emphatically;
- persevere, abide, to persist steadfastly in pursuit of an undertaking

Etymology: from the Middle Boral period in legal jargon, from Latin flāgitō "I require, solicit, accuse", possibly related to flagrum "whip, scourge, lash". The shift in emphasis to steadfastness has occurred by the eighteenth century.
