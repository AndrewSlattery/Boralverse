45.2: sortir ag vousc "to tryst"

sortir ag vousc /sɔrˈtɪr ɛj vux/
- to tryst, rendezvous, to meet somebody in private to be intimate with them;
- to hook up, to have a casual sexual experience with someone

Etymology: idiom attested from the late eighteenth century but probably older, literally meaning "to go out to the strawberries". The verb sortir "to go out" is a descendant of Latin sortior "to draw by lots, to distribute" with an unclearly-motivated but very early semantic change (compare cognate forms across Gaul and northern Italy).

The noun vousc "strawberry" reflects Old Boral baȝ vousc (cf. modern Boral bag /bɛj/ "berry"), presumably a calque of Old English’s synonymous stréawberȝe "strew-berry", so called for its plant growing low down, the fruits appearing to have been strewn across the ground. The putative verb ?voscar/vojar "to strew, scatter" is otherwise unattested, however—it is tempting to postulate a borrowing from Borland Kelt.
