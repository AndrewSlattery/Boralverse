106.2: crochet "biscuit"

crochet /kroˈkɛt/ [kʀʊˈkɛt]
- biscuit, cracker, cookie, wafer, a small flat baked good which is hard and crisp;
- puck, disc, discus, a hard squat cylindrical object especially as used in sports

Etymology: Middle Borlish diminutive from croccar "to crack", a dialect form (related to synonymous modern coroccar) which is presumably of onomatopoeic origin. Extended to other similarly-shaped objects from the nineteenth century.
