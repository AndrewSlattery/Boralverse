pille /pɪˈle/ [pɪˈle]
- felted, matted, fulled, brought together as a fabric with pressure and rolling instead of spinning and weaving;
- cushioned, padded, thick, soft, having thickness in a way which would lessen the impact of a collision;
- softened, mitigated, made less harmful or more palatable in some way

Etymology: Middle Boral learned borrowing from Latin pilleus "made of felt; felt cap"; compare inherited pegl "cap, woollen hat". Seen in metaphorical use from the sixteenth century.
