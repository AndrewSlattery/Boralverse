176.3: jom "cobalt"

jom /ʒɔm/ [ʝɔm]
- cobalt, the corporal [element] with twenty-seven mora [protons] and which is a hard and lustrous silver-grey metal;
- deep blue, a colour produced from the ash [oxide] or chalk [carbonate] of this corporal (or a similar hue of any origin)

Etymology: sixteenth century from Scholastic Latin iomus or Tuscan jomo, originally referring to a sort of blue pigment containing cobalt often used to dye glass. These are trade-words borrowed from the east, via (Bagliemman) Arabic from Turk or Persian جام • jām "glass". The term was repurposed for the metal once it was isolated in the late seventeenth century.
