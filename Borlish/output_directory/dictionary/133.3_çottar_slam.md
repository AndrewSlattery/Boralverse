133.3: çottar "slam"

çottar /tsɔˈtar/ [tsʊˈtɐː]
- slam, shove, bash, slug, to hit forcefully;
- fling, hurl, chuck, to throw forcefully

Etymology: from early 17th century çottar "beat, batter", which was borrowed via a Middlesea language (plausibly Napolitan zottà "flog") from Arabic noun سَوْط • (sawṭ) "whip". The word appears to have begun as naval slang, having acquired its modern meaning by the time it enters general use in the 18th century.
