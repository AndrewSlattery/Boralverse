93.4: ðalleyar "spread-eagle"

ðalleyar /ˌða.liˈjar/ [ˌða.ljɑː]
- spread-eagle, stretch, to lie down with the arms and legs outstretched;
- luxuriate, bask, to enjoy some luxury in the manner of (for example) a sunbather

Etymology: from Middle Borlish ðalleyar "spread-eagle, to stretch taut", extended from its used in tannery to describe leather stretched out on tenterhooks. This reflects Old Borlish ðalȝar "to be attached to, to be fastened to", directly from synonymous adalligō in Latin.
