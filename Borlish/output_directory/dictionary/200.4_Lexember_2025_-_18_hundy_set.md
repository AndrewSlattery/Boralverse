200.4: Lexember 2025 - 18: hundy "set"

hundy /hɪnˈdi/ [hɪnˈdi]
- hotel room, suite, a room or collection of connected rooms in a lodginghouse;
- chambers, apartment, a distinguished group of private rooms in a larger building used as an office or a residence;
- (university) set, lodgings, a student or faculty residence with a separate bedroom (as opposed to cubicr "bedsit, studio")

Etymology: nineteenth century, borrowed from Welsh hundy "bedchamber; (by extension) hotel room". This is a compound of hun "sleep" and ty "house". Initially confined to upmarket use, the word was extended to the university setting around the turn of the twentieth century. Compare roughly contemporaneous randy "apartment" < Welsh rhandy "wing (of a building); apartment".
