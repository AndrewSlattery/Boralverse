36.4: smuïr "shatter"

smuïr / smaˈjɪr/ [zmɐˈjɪː]
- shatter, smash, to break into tiny pieces;
- crumble, disintegrate, to fall apart into tiny pieces;
- burst, explode, rupture, to break violently due to internal pressure

Etymology: originally in the second sense, verbal derivative of muy "crumb, granule, tiny piece", which descends unproblematically (although with a change in spelling in the late Middle Boral period) from Latin mīca "crumb, grain". More violent senses are attested from the sixteenth century.
