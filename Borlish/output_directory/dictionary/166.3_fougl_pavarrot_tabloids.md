166.3: fougl pavarrot "tabloids"

fougl pavarrot /fuil ˌpa.vaˈrɔt/ [fwɪl ˌpa.vɐˈʀɔt]
- tabloids, newspapers considered to be more commercial and less prestigious than "high-brow" journalism;
- gutter press, yellow press, sensationalist reporters or newspapers in general;
- sensationalism, puffery, hype, the practise of exaggerating things for attention

Etymology: nineteenth-century phrase coined as an insult, literally meaning "little cash pages"; compare equivalent Merch term "bit-sheets". The noun fougl "leaf; page, sheet" descends via Old Borlish fouȝl from Latin folium "leaf". The noun pavarrot is a diminutive of pavar "poppy", here referring to a particular small coin used on Borland in the early modern period and reintroduced with a different denomination in the late twentieth period. The word descends from synonymous papāver in Latin, of unknown further origin.
