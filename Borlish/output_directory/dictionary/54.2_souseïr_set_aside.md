54.2: souseïr "set aside"

souseïr /ˌsu.ziˈjɪr/ [ˌsu.zɪˈjɪː]
- set aside, put away, to place something out of the way so that it can be used later;
- ground, run aground, to steer into too-shallow waters and get stuck there;
- settle, resolve, to deal conclusively with a problem;
- outclass, wipe the floor with, to surpass in a contest decisively

Etymology: from Middle Boral, a borrowing from Latin subsīdō "I crouch, subside" modelled on other verbs in -seïr like asseïr "dwell" and posseïr "own". First attested in the latter two senses in the seventeenth century, in early use seen particularly in the context of diplomatic disputes.
