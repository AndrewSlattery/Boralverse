101.2: raussið "backwards"

raussið /roˈsɪθ/ [ʀʊˈsɪh]
- backwards, backward, reversed, inverted, rotated or reflected so as to be in the opposite direction;
- unwilling, averse, reluctant, loath, not inclined or eager to do something;
- shy, timid, retiring, disinclined to social interaction;

Etymology: past participle of raussir "reverse, invert, flip". This is a motion verb derivation of now-obsolete raus "backwards", which descends via Old Borlish reaus, rears from Latin reversus "returned". In extended use the word is attested from the eighteenth century.
