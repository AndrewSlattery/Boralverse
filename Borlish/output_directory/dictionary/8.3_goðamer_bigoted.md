8.3: goðamer "bigoted"

goðamer /ˌgo.ðaˈmɛr/ [ˌgo.ðɐˈmɛː]
- sectarian, dogmatic, expressing fervent support for one set of religious beliefs over others or being unduly concerned with distinctions between people of different religious beliefs
- parochial, narrow-minded, having restricted or rigid views and being unreceptive to new ideas or focusing on local concerns to the exclusion of wider contexts
- (less charitably) bigoted, prejudiced, intolerant, forming negative opinions of groups of people without just cause

Etymology: adjectival derivation from goðam "sectarian person, dogmatist, chauvinist, bigot", itself attested from the early Middle Boral period originally in the sense "religious hypocrite, sanctimonious person, holier-than-thou person".

This comes from thirteenth-century French (likely Norman) godame, which was first used to refer to the Kentish and other English people in a derogatory manner, and is an adaptation of oath "God damn (thee)". Some commentators have suggested a source in various crusader bands of mixed Kentish and Norman soldiers, although there was sufficient contact ordinarily that such a supposition is not particularly necessary.
