211.3: lon mensc "dishonourable"

lon mensc /lɔn ˈmɛnx/ [lɔm ˈmɛŋx]
- (military) dishonourable, due to conduct that is considered reprehensible;
- without a reference, without a character, not being entitled to an employer's testimony when applying to a new job;
- (by extension) cold turkey, abruptly and without consideration for comfort

Etymology: originally in legal expressions such as destourm lon mensc "dishonourable discharge", the phrase literally means "without honour". The preposition lon "without" reflects Latin longē "far away"; the archaic noun mensc "honour; mercy; courtesy; decorum" was borrowed in the Old Borlish period from Old Norse mennska "humanity". Extension to non-miltary and non-employment contexts occurred in the mid-twentieth century.
