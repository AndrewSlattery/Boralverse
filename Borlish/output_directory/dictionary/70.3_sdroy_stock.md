70.3: sdroy "stock"

sdroy /sdrɔj/ [zdʀɔj]
- stock, inventory, stockpile, a store of goods to be sold;
- freight, cargo, goods or items in transport;
- depot, warehouse, building in which goods are stored in the course of transporting them

Etymology: first attested in the late medieval period as isdroȝ "freight, goods in transport over water; (especially) goods in the maritime trade mesh of the Stadbund [a group of cities in northern Germany and the surrounding regions]", borrowed from synoymous zdruog in contemporary Saxon. This is likely from Polish zdroi "(water) spring, small stream; origin, source, place to find something", though this word's sense development appears to be due to Saxon influence.
