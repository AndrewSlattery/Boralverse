7.4: kyriel "gamut"

kyriel /kiˈrjɛl/ [ˌkɪ.ʀɪˈʝɛw]
- (dated) a sort of short Christian prayer set to music;
- (musical) scale, sequence of notes usually contained within a single octave;
- procedure, rigmarole, a particular (often long or tiresome) method for performing a task
- range, gamut, spectrum, a complete selection of things;
- scope, compass, reach, the full extent within some scale that can be obtained or managed

Etymology: borrowed in the sixteenth century from French kyrielle, referring both to prayer set to music and to a musical scale (originally in particular the Phrygian mode, but by the time it was borrowed the usage had broadened). This word is a diminutive of kyrié, itself originally from Greek Κύριε ἐλέησον <Kúrie eléēson> "Lord, have mercy".
