74.4: commotual "turbulent"

commotual /ˌkɔ.moˈtjal/ [ˌkɔ.mʊˈtjal]
- turbulent, tumultuous, agitated, characterised by high-energy disturbance or unrest;
- disordered, in disarray, chaotic, with everything out of its proper place

Etymology: Middle Boral borrowing from Scholastic Latin commōtuālis "riotous, pertaining to political unrest", itself an adjectival derivation of commōtus "(esp. political) movement, unrest, commotion". Compare synonymous Classical mōtus and verb commoveō "I disturb, throw into disorder".
