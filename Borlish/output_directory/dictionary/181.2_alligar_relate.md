181.2: alligar "relate"

alligar /ˌa.liˈgar/ [ˌa.lɪˈgɐː]
- associate, relate, link, connect, to note resemblances or relevance of one thing to other things;
- compare, set against, juxtapose, to examine the similarities and differences between;
- match, correlate, to make the parts of two things or collections correspond

Etymology: Middle Borlish, borrowed from Latin alligō "I bind to, tie, fetter". Thus, this word is a doublet of inherited alleyar "ally, collaborate, partner". Formerly used for physical ties and links (as related ligar "bind, bandage" still is), but now restricted to abstract usage.
