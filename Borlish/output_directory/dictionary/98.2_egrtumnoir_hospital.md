98.2: egrtumnoir "hospital"

egrtumnoir /ˌijr̩.tɪmˈnɔir/ [ˌɪ.jɐ.tɪmˈnɔ.jɐ]
- clinic, hospital, a small medical facility especially for the treatment of outpatients

(compare sanatoir "hospital, infimary, asylum", which refers to larger institutions)

Etymology: Middle Borlish, location derivative of egrtumn "illness, ailment, sickness". This reflects synonymous eȝrtumne in Old Borlish, from eȝr "ill, sick" (cf. obsolete modern egr "sick") < Latin aeger "sick" and -tumne "-ness" < Vulgar Latin -tūmine (related to Classical -tūdinem).
