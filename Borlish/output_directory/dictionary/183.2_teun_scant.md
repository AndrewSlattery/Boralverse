183.2: teun "scant"

teun /taun/ [taun]
- scant, scanty, meagre, not in any great quantity;
- insufficient, paltry, not at all enough;
- rare, scarce, very uncommon;
- rarefied, thin, (of a gas) of low density

Etymology: via Old Borlish tiun, tieun "thin" from Latin tenuis "slight, weak". Thus, this word is one of the only pieces of evidence as to the development of post-stress /-w-/ (following a non-velar consonant) from Latin into Borlish. The semantic shift to senses relating to insufficiency is evidenced from the early Middle Borlish period.
