160.4: mot "lump"

mot /mɔt/ [mɔt]
- wad, lump, clod, an amorphous compact mass;
- plug, blockage, obstruction, jam, something that blocks a passage;
- issue, problem, bug, anything that holds up a process

Etymology: from Old Borlish mot "lump, mound" and thought to be of Germanic origin; possibly via Old French mote "hillock" from Frankish motta "mud, peat, turf". The term is first used in the "blockage" sense in the fifteenth century, and soon thereafter it sees metaphorical use.
