12.4: flaðrar "climb"

flaðrar /laðˈrar/ [flɐ(ð)ˈʀɑː]
- climb, scale, clamber up, to move along a vertical surface or structure by holding onto it with one's hands and feet;
- (of an insect) crawl, skitter, move nimbly with fast leg movements and especially along a wall or a ceiling;
- (by extension, of a person) manoeuvre oneself adroitly through difficult terrain or metaphorically through awkward circumstances

Etymology: originally in the first sense only, from Old Boral fladrar, flaðrar "to climb, scale", from Borland English hlǣdran "to climb (a ladder)", itself a derivation from noun hlǣder "ladder". Extension to insect movement is attested from the fourteenth century.
