132.3: run "symbol"

run /rɪn/ [ʀɪn]
- character, letter, the visual representation of a letter of a writing system;
- symbol, glyph, any non-verbal representation which imparts information;
- (historical, specifically) rune, a letter in one of the German writing systems

Etymology: originally in the last sense, descending from Old Borlish run /ryn/ "rune". This was borrowed either from Old Norse rún "secret, rune" or Old English rūn "mystery, rune". In the Middle Borlish period this word retained senses like "magic spell" and "talisman", but these became obsolete in the sixteenth century (although derivatives like runam "secretly" and runastr "sorcerer" survive to the modern day).
