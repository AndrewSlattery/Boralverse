151.4: borel "idiot"

borel /boˈrɛl/ [bʊˈʀɛl]
- idiot, fool, numpty, nincompoop, numbskull, dunderhead, a person lacking intelligence or common sense;
- sap, patsy, rube, chump, schmuck, a person who is notably naïve and easy to dupe;
- yokel, bumpkin, rustic, an unsophisticated person from a rural area

Etymology: disputed. The word is seen from the early Middle Borlish period with indeterminate meaning. Possibly a diminutive from an unattested *bour "peasant", which would have been borrowed from Old English (ġe)būr "farmer". Otherwise, perhaps a direct descendant from Latin puerīlis "youthful; childish". However, both explanations require somewhat irregular sound changes.
