Etymology: from Middle Boral adverb cosogr "as a pair, as a group"; prepositional use descends from the construction cosogr a X "in a set with X". This comes from Old Boral noun cosoȝre "the other of a pair, (in the plural) a matching pair of things" and homonymous adjective "corresponding, respective, concomitant".

The noun cosoȝre is a broadening of Borlish Latin cōsocer, cōsocrum "the other party to a contract", which is a local spelling and sense of Classical cōnsocer "the father of one's child's spouse"; the fathers of a marrying couple being prototypical counterparties to a contract.
