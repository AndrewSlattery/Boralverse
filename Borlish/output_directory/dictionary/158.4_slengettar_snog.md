158.4: slengettar "snog"

slengettar /ˌslɛn.gɛˈtar/ [ˌzlɛŋ.gɪˈtɐː]
- snog, pash, make out, French kiss, to kiss passionately (especially with tongue);
- mangle, botch, fumble, to do something sloppily;
- overegg, splurge, slather, to do something overenthusiastically;
- meddle, pry, butt in, overstep, badger, to be overly familiar or intrusive into personal or private matters

Etymology: originally in the first senses, attested along with the related noun slenget "snog, make-out session" in the late eighteenth century. It applies the somewhat pejorative verbal derivation s- -ar and the diminutive suffix -et to the root lenc "tongue" < Latin lingua "tongue". The first metaphorical extensions are each attested from the early twentieth century; in the sense of "meddle" it is an innovation of the last couple of decades.
