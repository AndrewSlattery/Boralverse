ðorn /ðɔrn/ [ðɔːn]
- punch, slug, blow, jab, a strike with one's fist;
- impact, oomph, welly, clout, force, the power to have an effect on something;
- charisma, charm, magnetism, the force of personality that inclines people to like one

Etymology: Middle Borlish deverbal from aðornar "punch", via Old Borlish from Insular Latin addurnō "I punch". This (possibly along with an unattested noun *durnus "fist") is borrowed from Borland Kelt; compare modern Welsh dyrnod "punch".
