208.2: a to-rutto "single file"

a to-rutto /a ˌto.rɪˈto/ [ɐˌto.ʀɪˈto]
- single file, in a line or queue one person wide;
- in a row, sequentially, one after another, successively, located in a linear span across space or time;
- one at a time, individually, occurring in discrete instances

Etymology: attested in various forms since the late Middle Borlish period, an ideophonic idiom used to refer to single-file sorts of arrangement or motion. The phrase is hypothesised to originate in farmers' livestock-counting numerals, which may be reflected by the modern appearance of to-rutto in counting-style nursery rhymes. These rural tally-like systems (e.g. an, to, ry, bo, bum, ...), which are present across Borland, derive from Germanic or Celtic numbers.
