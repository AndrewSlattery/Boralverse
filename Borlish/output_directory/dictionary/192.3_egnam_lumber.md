192.3: egnam "lumber"

egnam /ijˈnam/ [ɪjˈnam]
- timber, lumber, wood from trees used for construction;
- plank, a long and thick piece of timber;
- beam, post, rafter, a heavy piece of wood used to provide support for some part of a building;
- (colloquial, dated) idiot, dumbass, pillock, simpleton, somebody stupid;
- (vulgar, usually jocular) dick, cock, a penis

Etymology: Middle Borlish, rebracketing of earlier legnam "timber" reinterpreting the initial <l-> as the definite article. This is a borrowing from some Romance language's cognate of Medieval Latin lignāmen "timber"; it cannot be a direct descendant because native words reflect -āmen as -amn, cf. eramn "bronze", scamn "swarm". The word is no longer current as a personal insult except in one-off comparisons of somebody to a literal plank; in vulgar use the term is attested from the 1970s but may be much older.
