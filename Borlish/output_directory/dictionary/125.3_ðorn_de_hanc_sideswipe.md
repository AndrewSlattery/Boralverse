125.3: ðorn de hanc "sideswipe"

ðorn de hanc /ðɔrn de hank/ [ðɔːn de haŋk]
- swipe, sideswipe, hook, a punch or other strike from the side;
- bolt from the blue, a completely unexpected event (especially one for which you are utterly unprepared)

Etymology: phrase meaning "punch from (the) flank", used figuratively to describe an unexpected event since the late eighteenth century. The noun ðorn "punch" is a deverbal from now-obsolete aðornar "to punch", itself directly from synonymous addurnō in Insular Latin (of ultimate Kelt origin). The noun hanc "hip, hipbone; flank, loin, side" descends from Vulgar Latin hanca "hip", from a German source related to ankle in English.
