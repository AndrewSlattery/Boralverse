118.2: rostr "prow"

rostr /ˈrɔ.str̩/ [ˈʀɔ.stɐ]
- prow, bow, the front part of a ship or boat;
- vanguard, the leading members of a convoy of travellers or the leading part of a vehicle (especially of a train);
- (in extended use) forefront, leader, the front part of anything and especially in metaphor to denote the earliest adopters of a technology or custom;
- nib, the point of a pen or similar tool;
- tip, any pointed extremity

Etymology: an uncomplicated descendant from Latin rōstrum "bill, beak, snout, muzzle; prow". The latter meanings are thought to derive from the anatomical senses of the Latin word. Extension from boats to other vehicles and then into metaphorical usage occured during the Middle Borlish period.
