77.2: egreir "disembark"

egreir /eˈgrir/ [ɪˈgʀɪː]
- disembark, get off, go ashore, to leave a vehicle;
- step out, to exit a place on foot;
- sally forth, to set out in the manner of a soldier onto a battlefield;
- pass away, expire, perish, (euphemistically) to die

Etymology: Middle Boral borrowing from Latin ēgredior "I step out, disembark, overstep, leave", a compound of prefix ex- "out" and root gradior "I walk, march". It was modelled on the sole native descendant of a gradior compound, engreir "to begin; to sleep with" (since lost, although the participle engres "way in, starting point; sexual intercourse" remains). In euphemistic use the verb is first attested in the eighteenth century.
