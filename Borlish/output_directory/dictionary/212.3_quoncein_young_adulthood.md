212.3: quoncein "young adulthood"

quoncein /kwɔnˈtsin/ [kwʊnˈtsin]
- (strictly) twenties, the decade when a person is aged between 20 and 29 inclusive;
- young adulthood, a nebulous period of one's life which follows childhood and lasts approximately a decade;
- prime, trial run, Arcadia, a period in the existence of something which has any of various similarities to a person's young adulthood (the precise sense depending heavily on the speaker)

Etymology: twentieth-century calque of Willem quonzerád "young adulthood", an abstract derivation from southern dialect quonze "twenty" (standard twinte); the second element was replaced with the Borlish suffix -ein denoting a number of years (as in dezein "decade", carantein "a period of forty years"), which descends from Latin -ennium "years". Metaphorical extension of the word usually refers either to inexperience and naïveté or to a pinnacle of performance and flourishing.
