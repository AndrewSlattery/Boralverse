132.2: big "chariot"

big /baj/ [baj]
- (historical) chariot, a two-wheeled horse-drawn vehicle as used in Bronze and Iron Age warfare;
- bed, flatbed, a platform at the back of a vehicle on which one can sit or load cargo;
- trunk, boot, an enclosed space at the back of a vehicle for storage;
- sidecar, an attachment to a (motor)bike adding space for a passenger or cargo;
- (chess) rook, castle, the chess piece which moves orthogonally

Etymology: direct descendant via Old Borlish biȝ "wagon, haycart" from Latin bīga "chariot" (reflecting a reduced bi-iuga "two-yokes"). Revived in the sixteenth century in its historical sense, by which time it had shifted to "a platform for loading cargo", from which the other vehicular senses stem. Applied to the chess piece since the seventeenth century (formerly we see roc < Arabic رُخّ "rook").
