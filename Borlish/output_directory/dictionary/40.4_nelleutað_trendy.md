40.4: nell'eutað "trendy"

nell'eutað /ˌnɛ.lawˈtaθ/ [ˌnɛ.lɐwˈtah]
- fashionable, trendy, à la mode, in, up to date with the latest fashions and allowing one to display having good taste, a refined aesthetic sense or simply ample wealth

Etymology: adpositional phrase literally meaning "in the current fashion", attested since the late eighteenth century originally among the aristocratic melle of Borland's major cities. The noun eutað "mode, fashion, vibe, zeitgeist, style" is a nominal derivation from the verb eir "to go" (compare the past participle eut "gone"), which descends directly from Latin eō "I go".
