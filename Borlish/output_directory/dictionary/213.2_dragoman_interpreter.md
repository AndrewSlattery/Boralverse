dragoman /ˌdra.goˈman/ [ˌdʀa.gʊˈman]
- interpreter, translator, a person who translates speech to enable people without common languages to communicate;

Etymology: originally in the first senses and in particular with reference to interpreters of Arabic and Turk languages. The word was borrowed in the Middle Borlish period via Latin from Malchassian Greek δραγομάνος (dragomános) "interpreter"; this in turn came via Arabic and Syriac from Acadian 𒅴𒁄 (targumannum) "interpreter". Later semantic development was influenced by the suffix -man "-monger; seller, shop".
