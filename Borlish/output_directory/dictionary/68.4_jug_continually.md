68.4: jug "continually"

jug /ʒaj/ [ʝaj]
- continually, ever, still, remaining in a given state or continuing on a given course;
- immediately, instantly, now, starting at this exact moment;

Etymology: from Old Boral iui /dʒyj/ "always, forever, without stopping", which descends directly from Late Latin iūge "constantly, all the time". Replaced in the "always" sense by tojorn < toð jorn "all day" by the Middle Boral period. The expected modern spelling juy was over time altered to jug under the influence of the Latin form. In modern spoken usage the word is confined mostly to imperative constructions.
