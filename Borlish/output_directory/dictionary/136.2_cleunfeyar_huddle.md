cleunfeyar /ˌklawn.fiˈjar/ [ˌklawɱˈfjɐː]
- huddle, crowd, to stand close together;
- snuggle, cuddle, to be cosy or intimate with someone;
- clump, aggregate, to amass into a loose collection

Etymology: sixteenth century, verbal derivative of cleun "clump, lump" (now obsolete). This noun reflects Old Borlish cliun "ball, lump", a borrowing from synonymous clīewen in Old English which also gives e.g. Merch clewn "yarn".
