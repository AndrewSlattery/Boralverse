caugtrbal /ˌkoj.tr̩ˈbal/ [ˌkoj.tɐˈbal]
- football, kickball, any of a number of sports in which a ball is passed from person to person by kicking it

Etymology: eighteenth-century compound from caugtrar "to kick" and bal "ball". The verb descends from Latin calcitrō "I strike with the heel", itself from calx "heel". Used predominantly of various amateur activities until the introduction of (multiple sets of) standardised rules in the twentieth century.
