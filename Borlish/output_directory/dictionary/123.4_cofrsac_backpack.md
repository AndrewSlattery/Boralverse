123.4: cofrsac "backpack"

cofrsac /ˌkɔfr̩ˈsak/ [ˌkɔ.fɐˈsak]
- backpack, rucksack, a case of leather or fabric for carrying things on the back;
- shoulder bag, messenger bag, a sack worn on one shoulder and around the chest

Etymology: Middle Borlish, compound of cofr "basket" (now archaic or dialect) < synonymous cophinus in Latin, and sac < Latin saccus "bag, sack". Originally in the latter senses, denoting a bag carried like a basket; in the "backpack" sense it is attested only from the late nineteenth century.
