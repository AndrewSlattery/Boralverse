a plaç entarn /a plats ɛnˈtarn/ [ɐ ˈplats ɪnˈtɐːn]
- some way in, lodged, embedded, inside, located (usually not far) underneath the surface of something;

- after a while, not at first, eventually, only at some time later than the beginning of something

Etymology: phrase meaning "at (a) position inside", used idiomatically from as early as the fourteenth century. The noun plaç "position" is an Old Borlish borrowing via Old French place "location" from Latin platea "courtyard". The adverb entarn "inside", which corresponds to the preposition ne "in", descends directly from Latin adjective internus "internal, interior".
