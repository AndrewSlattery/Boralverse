19.4: xiphar "scimitar"

xiphar /ksiˈfar/ [ksɪˈfɑː]
- scimitar, falchion, sabre, single-edged sword with a somewhat-curved blade reminiscent of a scythe;
- sellsword, freelance, a mercenary of the medieval period and especially such a person from the Masreck [the Levant]
- henchman, lackey, loyal subordinate usually working for someone with criminal  or otherwise-ill intent

Etymology: via Italian from late medieval Greek ξιφάρα <xiphára> "longsword, scimitar", an augmentative of ξῐ́φος <xíphos> "sword". Used metonymically in the second sense since the early nineteenth century in selfconscious reference to a fictionalised medieval period.
