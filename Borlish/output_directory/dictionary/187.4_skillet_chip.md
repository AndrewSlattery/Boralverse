187.4: skillet "chip"

skillet /skɪˈlɛt/ [skɪˈlɛt]
- chip, fragment, shard, piece, a small part broken off a larger whole;
- splinter, sliver, a long and sharp fragment of a material such as wood;
- chip, fry, a fried strip of potato or similar food

Etymology: early modern Borlish, apparently from Kernish askleut or Devoner skylot "chips, shavings, splinters". These both descend from Classical British asclod "splinter", a borrowing from Late Latin ascla which itself is a variant of Classical assula "splinter". The word was first applied to foods in the seventeenth century and had specialised to starches like potatoes by the nineteenth.
