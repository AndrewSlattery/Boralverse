alçor /alˈtsɔr/ [ɐlˈtsɔː]
- higher, further, additional, advanced, (education) more difficult or complex and requiring some prerequisite;
- (colloquial) tricky, 4-D, clever, (with sarcastic force) requiring great intelligence and strategy especially applied to contexts that fully don't need cleverness

Etymology: eighteenth century, originally in universities to refer to subjects like Rhetoric Alçor "Higher Rhetoric"; a direct borrowing from Latin altior "higher". Eventually the word was applied to institutions as a whole, like the Schol Alçor de Nadacou "Nadacow Higher School". Its vernacular extension originates in student slang during the Good Game period.
