80.4: rif "riverbank"

rif /rɪf/ [ʀɪf]
- bank, riverbank, the area along the sides of a river or stream;
- shore, seashore, strand, a stretch of coastline (especially when stony as opposed to sandy);
- beachfront, seaside, promenade, terrace, esplanade, a walkway between land and sea often lined with shops

Etymology: uncomplicated descendant via Old Boral rif from Latin rīpa "riverbank, seashore". By the Middle Boral period we see a clear semantic separation between sandy play "beach, bay" and stony rif, although some place names like Volandry (from dialect volan "gull" and rif "beach") fail to fit this dichotomy.
