89.4: sveldr "whittle"

sveldr /ˈsvɛl.dr̩/ [ˈzvɛl.dɐ]
- pluck, to remove the feathers from a bird;
- whittle, carve, to cut or shave a piece of wood with a knife;
- reduce, thin, cut away at, to gradually make something smaller or less numerous;
- winnow, to separate out the best members or items of a group and remove the rest;

Etymology: from Old Borlish isveldre "to pluck, remove parts of", a pleonastic derivative of a presumed *veldre descending directly from Latin vellō "I pluck, depilate, demolish". Extension to woodworking is attested by the thirteenth century, in abstract use it is seen from the fifteenth, and the colloquial sense first arose in the late eighteenth before a revival (or re-coining) in the twentieth.
