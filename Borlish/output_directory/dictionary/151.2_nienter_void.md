151.2: nienter "void"

nienter /njɛnˈtɛr/ [njɪnˈtɛː]
- (rare) void, empty, vacant, not filled or occupied;
- useless, ineffective, futile, vain, not producing any effect;
- invalid, worthless, without legal force or other analogous use;
- nihilist, pessimistic, holding that things do not have any point or purpose

Etymology: adjective derivation from nien "nothing" (earlier nient), which reflects either nē gentem "no person" or nē entem "no being" in Late Latin. Even in early texts the word has seldom been used literally (competing with vogt "empty"); senses to the effect of "amounting to nothing" predominate.
