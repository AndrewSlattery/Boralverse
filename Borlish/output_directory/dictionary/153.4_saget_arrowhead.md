153.4: saget "arrowhead"

saget /saˈʒɛt/ [sɐˈʝɛt]
- arrowhead, the pointed part of an arrow or similar projectile;
- arrow, the pictorial representation of an arrow used to indicate direction;
- chevron, vee, a V shape;

- one of the suits in the so-called "Maritime" card deck [1]

Etymology: Old Borlish saget "arrow", a semi-learned form reflecting Latin sagitta "arrow, shaft, bolt". The term was displaced in referring to the whole arrow by Germanic loan flesc "arrow". Metaphorical extensions are seen first in heraldic descriptions; the computing sense dates to the late twentieth century.
