188.2: bechettar "dig in"

bechettar /ˌbe.kɛˈtar/ [ˌbe.kɪˈtɐː]
- dig in, chow down, tuck in, to begin eating;
- munch, nosh, to eat vigorously or noisily;
- get stuck in, engage, to become enthusiastically involved in an activity

Etymology: nineteenth century verbal derivative of the noun bec "beak, snout, muzzle; (colloquial, of people) mouth". This descends directly from Latin beccus "beak, bill", a borrowing from Gaulish. In metaphorical usage the word is seen from the early twentieth century.
