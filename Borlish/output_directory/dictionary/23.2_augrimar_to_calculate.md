23.2: augrimar "to calculate"

augrimar /ˌo.griˈmar/ [ˌo.gʀɪˈmɑː]
- to calculate, compute, reckon, to determine an unknown quantity by mathematical means;
- (by extension) to perform algebraic manipulations on a mathematical expression;
- to reckon, suppose, guess, to deduce or conclude by the weighing of possibilities

Etymology: fifteenth-century verbal derivation from earlier augrim /oˈgrɪm/ "calculation, computation, arithmetic", which originally meant in particular "calculation using Arabic numerals". This comes from synonymous early Kentish or Norman augri(s)me, from Medieval Latin algorismus; this is taken from the name of the Persian mathematician al-Khawarismi, whose works introduced the positional number system to Europe.
