209.2: cirteyar "peddle"

cirteyar /tsɪrˈtjar/ [tsɪːˈtjɐː]
- peddle, hawk, solicit, flog, to travel around (e.g. from door to door) in order to sell;
- (archaic) sojourn, itinerate, peregrinate, tour, to travel from place to place;
- (reflexive) importune, bother, pester, mither, disturb, to harass with e.g. persistent requests;
- (reflexive) come on to, proposition, to make amorous advances

Etymology: originally in the first sense, an extension from early old Borlish ceȝrtar "peddle, itinerate" with a causative suffix. This in turn descends from Late Latin circitō "I peddle, frequent", from circō "I traverse, wander through". In reflexive use the word is attested from the early modern period.
