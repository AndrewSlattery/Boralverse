Etymology: from Scholastic Latin congenēscō "I bring into being", a regularised derivative of gignō "I beget" (past participle genitus "begotten"). Originally restricted to familial legal contexts, the word had entered the wider lexicon via patent law by the early modern period. In modern usage the verb is preferentially used as an infinitive or participle, although conjugated forms are still well attested.
