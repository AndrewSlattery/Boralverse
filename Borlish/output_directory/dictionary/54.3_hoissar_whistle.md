54.3: hoissar "whistle"

hoissar /hɔjˈsar/ [hʊjˈsɑː]
- whistle, to make a sound by forcing air through one's mouth;
- blow, to make music with a wind instrument or noise with a whistling device;
- disobey, flout, to express contempt for rules or laws by word or action;
- skive, skip, shirk, to renouce one's responsibilities especially with regards to school or work

Etymology: from Middle Boral hoisçar "whistle, flout", probably of onomatopoeic origin. Otherwise, perhaps a borrowing from Old English hwistlian "to whistle". Its subsequent semantic development is unclear but mirrored in e.g. Dutch fluiten "to play the flute, to scorn, to scoff".
