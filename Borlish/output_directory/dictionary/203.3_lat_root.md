203.3: lat "root"

lat /lat/ [lat]
- side, edge, a one-dimesional segment of the surface of a shape;
- root, a number which when raised to a given power yields a particular quantity (especially the square root);
- cusp, precipice, an abrupt boundary between two relatively smooth planes;
- verge, brink, threshold, an edge or margin before a sudden or dramatic change

Etymology: Middle Borlish, a borrowing from Latin latus "side, flank". Originally used in geometry, and extended to the arithmetic usage by analogy to the example of a square's area and side-length. Senses referring to metaphorical sudden boundaries are attested from the eighteenth century.
