123.3: ðorof "drove"

ðorof /ðoˈrɔf/ [ðʊˈʀɔf]
- drove, a group of animals being driven as to market or between fields;
- (by extension) any group of people or animals on the move being led by someone;
- herd, flock, a group of certain animals such as rabbits and hares

Etymology: from Old Borlish ðor(o)f "assembly, herd", a borrowing influenced both by Old English þorp, þrop "village, assembly" and by drāf "the action of driving; herd, company; road". Compare the word garaf "grip" from Old Portingale grafo, garfo "hook" for the result of Vr, rV metathesis.
