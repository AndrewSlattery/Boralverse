16.3: kenopleus "space travel"

kenopleus /ˌke.noˈplawz/
- voidsailing, space travel, voyage through space

Etymology: nineteenth-century derivation coined during the voidtale craze sparked by Durgh'nen Shorzen Shouer (Through a Black Mirror) in 1795, from Ancient Greek prefix κενο- "empty" and stem πλεῦσις "sailing". Since then, both components have been in somewhat productive use in the field (both real and fictional, the latter often inspiring terminology in the former); see for example kenomaturg "astronaut, lit. void-worker" attested from 1876 and augeopleus "space travel by means of a solar sail, lit. sunlight-sailing" from 1909.
