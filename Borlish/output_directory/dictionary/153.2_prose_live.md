153.2: prose "live"

prose /proˈze/ [pʁʊˈze]
- direct, straight, immediate, proceeding by the shortest possible route;
- unmediated, firsthand, primary, without any intermediary;
- live, in real time, having no delay between recording and broadcast

Etymology: either from Scholastic Latin prōseus "direct" or prōsē "directly", both derivatives of prō(r)sus "direct". This in turn appears to be from the prefix prō- "forward" and Old Latin vorsus "turned". In the last senses the term is attested from the 1920s.
