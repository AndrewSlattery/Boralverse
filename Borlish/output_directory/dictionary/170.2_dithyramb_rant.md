170.2: dithyramb "rant"

dithyramb /ˌdi.θiˈramb/ [ˌdi.θɪˈʀamb]
- (historical) dithyramb, a raucous and ardent choral hymn sung in ancient Greece in honor of the god Dionysus;
- ode, ballad, any of various poetic or musical forms characterised by the communication of intense emotions;
- diatribe, rant, tirade, polemic, an impassioned oration or piece of writing (often with positive affect)

Etymology: originally in the first sense, borrowed in the early modern period via Latin from δῑθῠ́ρᾰμβος • dīthŭ́rămbos in Ancient Greek. In poetic use the word has never denoted any particular metre or form; its intentional vagueness has allowed poets to use the term for a diverse array of works. In the last senses the term is attested from the nineteenth century.
