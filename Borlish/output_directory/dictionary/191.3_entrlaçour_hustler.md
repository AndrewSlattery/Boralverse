191.3: entrlaçour "hustler"

entrlaçour /ˌɛnt.r̩.laˈtsur/ [ˌɛn.tɐ.lɐˈtsʊː]
- wheeler-dealer, hustler, schemer, a shrewd or unscrupulous operator in politics or commerce;
- swindler, sharpster, grifter, con artist, racketeer, someone running scams;
- pedlar, huckster, a small-time or itinerant merchant of (usually poor-quality) goods

Etymology: nineteenth century, borrowed (probably via intermedaries) from Sicilia ntrlazzaturi "swindler, racketeer". This is an agentive derivation from the noun ntrlazzu "scam, racket", which reflects Latin inter- "between" and laqueus "noose". Specialisation to politics probably occurred before the word entered Borlish, although there was no shortage of corruption in contempory governance on Borland to inspire the shift.
