- preeminent, superior, leading, distinguished, held in particularly high regard;
- noteworthy, famous, renowned, widely known or celebrated for something or somebody's qualities or deeds;
- noticeable, conspicuous, standing out, blatant, remarkable or evident to the senses or the mind

Etymology: Middle Borlish borrowing from Latin excellēns "surpassing, eminent", the present participle of verb excellō "I rise, project, excel". The extension of the word both to general noteworthiness and to obviousness had occurred by the eighteenth century.
