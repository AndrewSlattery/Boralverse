Etymology: literally "to write on the walls of Pompeii", first attested as an idiom in Napolitan some years after the unearthing of the ruins of Pompeii and the uncovering of its trove of graffiti. The verb scaur "write", which displaced now-obsolete or poetic scrir "write", descends from Latin scalpō "I scratch; I engrave". The last sense, attested in Borlish since the 1920s, refers directly to the volcanic eruption of 79N which buried the city.
