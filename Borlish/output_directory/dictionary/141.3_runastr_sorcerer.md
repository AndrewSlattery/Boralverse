Etymology: Middle Borlish, derivative of run "magic spell, talisman" with the pejorative suffix -astr < Latin -aster "resembling, quasi-" (compare contemporaneous but now obsolete runart "sorcerer"). Originally restricted to those doing evil or harm with magic, the word had become a generic word for a magic user by the late eighteenth century. In the last senses it is seen in slang from the early twentieth century.
