45.4: birgasq "apricot"

birgasq /bɪrˈgask/ [bɪːˈgask]
- apricot, pale orange-coloured fruit of a tree in the Prunus genus which spread throughout the Roman Empire by way of Armenia;
- a pale yellow-orange colour like that of the fruit;
- something or someone considered particularly admirable or coveted;
- a particularly contented or satisfied emotional state;

Etymology: from the Middle Boral period, a borrowing from northern Portingale o birgasque "the apricot", variant of earlier obirgoque apparently influenced by synonym damasco, literally "from Damascus". This in turn comes from Arabic الْبَرْقُوق (al-barqūq) "apricots, (later) plums", probably via the form albercoc in Barcelon.

Its figurative extension is in evidence from the eighteenth century, originally used to describe particularly attractive women; compare similar uses of various words for fruits in other languages.
