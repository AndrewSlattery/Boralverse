110.2: plouç "screen"

plouç /pluts/ [pluts]
- screen, windbreak, a moveable (often folding) barrier;
- disguise, camouflage, guise, concealment, anything that serves to hide something from view;
- front, cover, façade, the public-facing version of something concealed for personal or legal reasons;
- act, persona, show, an intentional and false impression of oneself

Etymology: originally restricted to the first sense, a direct descendant (or via Old French, but the cognate plouce "shutter" is unattested before the twelfth century, and may instead be from Borlish) of Latin pluteus "railing; screen; bookcase". Metaphorical extension to other forms of concealment is attested from the Middle Borlish poetry of Kigman in the fifteenth century.
