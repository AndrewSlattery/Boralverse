186.4: y sona hurstar "take one's place"

y sona hurstar /i soˈna hɪrˈstar/ [i sʊˈna hɪːˈstɐː]
- take one's place, make it, to attain a position that one is supposed or destined to reach;
- step up, rise to the occasion, to assume some responsibility;
- come into one's own, flourish, thrive, to begin to do well in a newly cquired role

Etymology: idiom from the nineteenth century, literally "to equip the role". The noun sona "role" derives from thespian slang in the early modern period, a clipping of Latin persōna "mask; character, part, role". The verb descends from Old Borlish hurstar "decorate, adorn", a borrowing from synonymous hyrstan in Old English (compare Merch hirstend "superfluous").
