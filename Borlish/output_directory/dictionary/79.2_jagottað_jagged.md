79.2: jagottað "jagged"

jagottað /ˌʒa.gɔˈtaθ/ [ˌʝa.gʊˈtah]
- jagged, notched, serrated, rough, being unevenly cut or having a similar texture to something so cut;
- craggy, rugged, (of landscape) characterised by unpredictable changes in elevation;
- abrasive, harsh, disagreeable, being overly agressive in one's manner and causing irritation

Etymology: past participle of jagottar "to notch, serrate", from noun jagot "notch, snag, sharp projection", of uncertain origin. Likely a diminutive of a form *jac, jag, which must be related somehow to the synonymous jag in Merch—the direction of borrowing is however unclear since the Merch is only attested from the fifteenth century. Attempts have been made to connect the words to Borland English çagge "shrub" but the semantics are doubtful.
