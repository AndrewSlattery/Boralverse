Etymology: 1812, coined along with the noun impisantour "weightlessness" during the voidtale craze of popular fiction set out among the stars. The noun is from the much older pisantour "weightiness", itself from adjective pisant "weighty, burdensome". These all derive originally from pis "weight", the descendant of synonymous pēnsum in Latin. In extended use the word is attested from the late nineteenth century, with the slightly disparaging connotation established shortly thereafter.
