Etymology: originally in the first senses, from Old Boral teissir, tistre, teȝsre (among many other forms) "to weave, work with thread". These all derive from either Latin texere "to weave" or a Late Latin texēre exhibiting a change of conjugation. Use in the narrative sense is attested as far back as the Classical period; much of the metaphorical usage is likely extended from this first idiom.
