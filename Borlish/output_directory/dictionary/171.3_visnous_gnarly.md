171.3: visnous "gnarly"

visnous /vɪˈznuz/ [vɪˈznuz]
- wizened, rugged, made rough by age or exposure;
- gaunt, haggard, emaciated, looking severely ill and malnourished;
- gnarly, knotty, knobbly, bumpy, shaped like wood with many knots

Etymology: Middle Borlish, adjectival derivation from now-obsolete verb visnar "to wither". This descends from an Old Borlish borrowing from Old English wisnian "dry up, shrivel". The arboreal senses (literally or figuratively) are now the most current, with a noun visn "knot in wood" having been backformed from the adjective.
