29.2: treublar "annoy"

treublar /trawˈblar/ [tʀɐwˈblɑː]
- to trouble, annoy, distress, bother, to cause somebody to be anxious or perplexed;
- to hinder, fetter, hold back, to be an obstacle preventing someone from acting as they wish

Etymology: from Old Boral treular, triblar (among other forms) "to pressure, to stopper", which descend directly from Latin trībulō "I press, squeeze, extract". The survival of the form treublar in particular may be due to influence from unrelated contemporary English troublen or French troubler, which are related via metathesis to Vulgar Latin turbulō "I disrupt, perturb".
