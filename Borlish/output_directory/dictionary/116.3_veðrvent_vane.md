116.3: veðrvent "vane"

veðrvent /ˌvɛ.ðr̩ˈvɛnt/ [ˌvɛ.ðɐˈvɛnt]
- vane, weathervane, weathercock, a  mechanical device rotating around one axis and attached to an elevated object such as a roof for showing the direction of the wind;
- anemometer, windmeter, a more sophisticated device for measuring and recording the speed and direction of the wind;
- (metaphorically) volte-face, about-face, U-turn, flip-flop, a sudden reversal of opinion or strategy

Etymology: folk-etymological alteration of Old Borlish veðrevit "vane" under the influence of vent "wind" < synonymous ventus in Latin. The Old Borlish is a borrowing from Old Norse veðrviti "vane", literally "weather knower". Synchronically interpretable as "wind-glass"; though they are not normally made of glass, the word has been analysed as referring to glassware used for measurement. In metaphorical usage the word is seen from the eighteenth century.
