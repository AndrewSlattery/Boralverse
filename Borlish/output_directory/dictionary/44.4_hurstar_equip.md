44.4: hurstar "equip"

hurstar /hɪrˈstar/ [hɪːˈstɑː]
- equip, be supplied with, to obtain something necessary (especially weaponry or similar tools) in order to carry out a specific action or task;
- don, put on, to clothe oneself with some article of clothing or accessory;
- be taught, self-teach, train oneself in, to learn a particular skill in preparation for some specific situation

Etymology: descendant of Old Boral hurstar "decorate, adorn" with a shift in argument structure (the patient changing from the thing receiving ornament to the items used to adorn) in evidence from the fourteenth century onward. This itself is a borrowing from synonymous Old English hyrstan; compare Merch hirstend /ˈhɪːsən/ "decorative, extra, superfluous".
