hellinar "plug"

hellinar /ˌhɛ.liˈnar/ [ˌhɛ.lɪˈnɑː]
- plug, bung, stop, to block an opening with an object making it tightly sealed;
- cope, deal, to manage a (usually difficult) situation effectively

Etymology: verbal derivation from hellin "cork; plug, bung", itself borrowed from Vascon or Leon hellino "cork (substance); bottle stopper". This is a sufficiently-early loan from Arabic فَلِّين <fallīn> "cork" that it exhibits the f > h sound shift characteristic of northern Spanish languages.

Jo's eut may hellinar a tu pos figurar.
