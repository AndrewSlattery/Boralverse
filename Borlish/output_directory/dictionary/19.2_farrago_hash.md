19.2: farrago "hash"

farrago /ˌfa.raˈgo/ [ˌfa.ʀɐˈgo]
- hash, chopped food (usually meat and potatoes) mixed together;
- jumble, hodgepodge, miscellany, a collection of various things or people

Etymology: borrowed in the seventeenth century from Latin farrago "fodder for animals, mishmash", likely via somewhat-earlier use in Italian cuisine. Used metaphorically from the very beginning, retained from its use in the way in Latin.
