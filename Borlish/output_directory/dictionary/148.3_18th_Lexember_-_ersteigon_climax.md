Etymology: originally a term of art, borrowed from Saxon ersteigon "rise, climb, ascension", a noun from steige "climb". This properly referred to the events before the climax, but by the time of borrowing the shift in meaning had become entrenched. The term was used in more general contexts in Borlish by the mid-nineteenth century.
