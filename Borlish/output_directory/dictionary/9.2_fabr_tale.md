9.2: fabr "tale"

fabr /ˈfa.br̩/ [ˈfa.bɐ]
- tale, story, narrative, the account of a sequence of events with strong connotations of being fictional (compare stoir, narrað);
- play, production, performance, story told via live actors in a theatre;
- (by extension) drama, adventure, excitement, implausible events resembling those of popular theatre;
- (in philosophy) matter, concern, a particular topic under discussion or relevant to a scenario

Etymology: from Old Boral fable "fable, tale" a semi-learned borrowing (possibly via Old French) from Latin fabula "narrative, story". Seen in the sense of "play" from the thirteenth century, which may be an independent development or perhaps influenced by Classical usage of fabula to mean "poem, dramatic narration". The philosophical sense, first seen in the nineteenth century, is definitely a learned use from the Classical word, which could be used in that way.
