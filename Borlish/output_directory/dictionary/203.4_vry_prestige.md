203.4: vry "prestige"

vry /vri/ [vʀi]
- prestige, status, cachet, fame, esteem, the state of being well-thought-of by people;
- power, influence, the ability to effect one's will or to have people consider one an authority;
- kudos, acclaim, accolades, praise, credit for one's achievements

Etymology: nineteenth-century borrowing from a lenited form of Welsh bri "prestige, honour". This descends from pre-Classical Kelt brīgos "importance, weight", though to be cognate with Latin gravis "heavy". Originally a somewhat déclassé slang term, the word had passed into the ordinary register by the mid-twentieth century. A brief period of use as a approbatory interjection was over outside ironic mimicry by the 1980s.
