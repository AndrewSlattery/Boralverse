187.3: yauvnar "pat"

yauvnar /jovˈnar/ [ʝʊvˈnɐː/
- pat, to gently tap the flat of one's hand against;
- tamp down, flatten, to hit or push against from above to make smooth or flat;
- unruffle, smooth out, to remove the bumpiness from by e.g. stretching out;

Etymology: originally in the latter senses, descendant of Old Borlish iawnar "to smooth, even, flatten". This is a borrowing from Old Norrish [Norse] jafna "to make even", a verbal derivative of jafn "even; equal, same". Specialisation to the act of tapping the flat of one's hand against something is seen from the fifteenth century.
