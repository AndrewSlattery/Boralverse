53.2: quesq "damson"

quesq /kwɛsk/ [kwɛsk]
- damson, a subspecies of plum tree with sweeter and slightly ovoid fruits;
- damson, the fruit of this tree;
- deep purple, plum, aubergine, the colour of the damson fruit;
- cream of the crop, pick of the litter, the choice or most desirable part of something

Etymology: from Middle Boral (prun) quesq "damson (plum)", borrowed from Dutch dialectal queske, queshken "damson". This is a variant of synonymous standard Saxon tweshge and Bavarn zweschen, both borrowed from Vulgar Latin davascena "damascene plum" (cf. Classical damascēnum).

In metaphorical use a clipping of phrase quesq a tort "damson in the pie", attested from the seventeenth century.
