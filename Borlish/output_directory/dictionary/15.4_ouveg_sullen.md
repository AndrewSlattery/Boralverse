15.4: ouveg "sullen"

ouveg /uˈvij/ [ʊˈvɪj]
- sullen, sulky, having a brooding temper and a tendency to anger;
- gloomy, dismal, melancholy, characterised by sadness or pessimism (either of a person or a setting)

Etymology: from a variety of Old Boral forms oȝbeu(ȝ), ovieȝ et al. "unfriendly, rude" (the variant form ogveu /ɔjˈvaw/ was formerly widespread in the southern dialects), which descends from Vulgar Latin oblaecus "hostile", a variant of Classical obliquus "sidelong, oblique, envious, hostile" (see also Lombard biego "sinister, ominous" from the same Vulgar source).
