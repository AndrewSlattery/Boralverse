bastegl /baˈstɪjl/ [baˈstɪjl]
- fortress, fortification, a strongly built and defended military structure or enclosure used in warfare;
- bastion, stronghold, a secure position or place of power and influence;

Etymology: a borrowing from Middle French bastille "fortress", itself from early Doccian [Occitan] bastida "fortress, edifice" adapted to the -ille suffix < Latin īle "enclosure". This comes from Late Latin bastiō "I build; I sew", a borrowing from Frankish. In metaphorical usage the word is in evidence from the eighteenth century.
