88.4: desveyar "deviate"

desveyar /ˌdɛs.viˈjar/ [ˌdɛ.zvɪˈʝɑː]
- swerve, veer, yaw, to go out of a straight line of motion;
- deflect, deviate, detour, turn aside, to change course (or metaphorically, plans);
- dodge, sidestep, to move out of the way of something

Etymology: from Old Boral desveyar "stray, deviate, go off course", inherited from Late Latin disviō "I leave the path", a variant of synonymous deviō in Classical Latin. Alternatively, a later formation from Old Boral vey "path, course" < Latin via "road" (compare modern veyaç "trip, journey").
