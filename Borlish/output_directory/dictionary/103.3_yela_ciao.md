103.3: yela "ciao"

yela /jeˈla/ [jɪˈla]

bye, ciao, an informal formula used by a speaker who is leaving; (archaic) goodbye, farewell, used also in formal contexts;
(sometimes proscribed) hello, hi, used also as an informal greeting

Etymology: via Middle Borlish yelað "farewell, goodbye" from Old Borlish vos ielað "may you fare well, be strong, abide, endure, persevere". This is a conjugated form of ieleir "abide, persist, persevere" (the would-be reflex yelir is obsolete by the fourteenth century), which is thought to reflect Latin haereō "I cling, adhere, remain fixed". As a greeting the word is attested from the early twentieth century.
