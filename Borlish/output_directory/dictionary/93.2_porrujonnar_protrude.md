Etymology: Middle Borlish verbal derivation of porrujon "balcony, mezzanine" (at the time meaning "overhang, bulge, thrust"). This is from Old Borlish verb p(r)odrure "thrust forward, bulge out", from Latin verb prōtrūdō "I push forwards, I protrude". In metaphorical use, seen from the seventeenth century.
