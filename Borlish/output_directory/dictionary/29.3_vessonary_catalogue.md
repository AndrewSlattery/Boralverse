29.3: vessonary "catalogue"

vessonary /ˌvɛ.so.naˈri/ [ˌvɛ.sʊ.nɐˈʀi]
- fashion plate, costumery, a collection of pictures illustrating the latest fashions in clothes;
- (more broadly) catalogue, a retailer's publication detailing their stock allowing readers to have items delivered;
- portfolio, an artist's compilation of example works used in applying to potential employers

Etymology: from the late eighteenth century, a derivation of vesson "outfit, costume". This descends from Old Boral vesçon "clothing, attire", from synonymous Insular Latin vestiō which is a Borland-specific derivative of vestis "garment, article of clothing". Extension to general collections of products is seen by the mid-twentieth century.
