153.3: çougr "wild"

çougr /tsugr̩/ [ˈtsu.gɐ]
- wild, untamed, not having been domesticated or trained for husbandry;
- uncontrolled, uninhibited, unrestrained, without limits on behaviour;
- misbehaving, unruly, acting out, disobedient, not doing as one is told;
- rude, tactless, without regard for etiquette

Etymology: 19C, imported from slang used on the Borlish-speaking islands of the Arcabil [Caribbean] but cognate with terms used across the whole region, including northern Cappatia [South America]. These originate in Run'allo [Quechua] chucru "difficult", as used to describe animals. The unrelated bougr "boor, scoundrel" may have influenced the word's sense development.
