185.2: pestriçon "formation"

pestriçon /ˌpɛ.striˈtsɔn/ [ˌpɛ.stʀɪˈtsɔn]
- formation, development, emergence, creation, genesis, the process during which something comes into being;
- assembly, arrangement, shape, form, configuration, structure, layout, the manner in which something is physically composed in space

Etymology: early Modern Borlish, a noun derivation from verb pestrir "knead; mould, form, shape". This is a direct descendant from Vulgar Latin pistriō "I knead", from Classical Latin pistor "baker, miller". Initially referring to the act of kneading dough or moulding clay, the word took on more general senses almost at once.
