15.3: ustolment "manners"

ustolment /ˌi.stɔlˈmɛnt/ [ˌi.stʊwˈmɛnt]
- manners, etiquette, decorum, courtesy, the appropriate behaviour required by a particular social context;
- refinement, sophistication, elegance, stylishness, the quality of having cultivated a high-class affect

Etymology: Middle Boral nominal derivation from verb ustoldr "to behave well, to act properly" which continues Old Boral ustolre /ysˈtol.rə/, itself a univerbation of us tolre "to uphold customs, to act honourably", both parts of which are obsolete in the modern language.

The noun us "customs, mores, traditions" descends from Latin ūsus "use, practice, custom" (compare modern usar "to use up, wear out"), while the verb toldr "to lift up, give out, pass time" is from Latin tollō "I raise, remove".
