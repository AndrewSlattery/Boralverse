169.2: sacr "wicked"

sacr /ˈsa.kr̩/ [ˈsa.kɐ]
- (formal or poetic) sacred, sainted, holy, hallowed, characterised by solemn religious ceremony or religious use;
- essential, vital, key, crucial, pivotal, of extreme importance;
- (colloquial, dated) cool, wicked, awesome, very interesting or impressive in an exciting way

Etymology: originally in the first senses, a Middle Borlish reborrowing from Latin sacer "sacred, holy". With these meanings the words is mostly confined to idioms, collocations (y Bibr Sacr "the Holy Bible") and poetry, supplanted by words like sacrað and sagntað "holy". In the last senses the word was briefly popular in the mid-twentieth century and it is occasionally still used (alongside the comparative sacherrem which saw similar use somewhat later) to evoke the period.
