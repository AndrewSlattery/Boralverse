184.2: veðrdon "prize"

veðrdon /ˌvɛð.r̩ˈdɔn/ [ˌvɛ.ðɐˈdɔn]
- prize, award, honour, a reward striven for in a competition or which may be won by chance;
- trophy, cup, an object (often a statuette or vessel) commemorating one's victory in a competition;

Etymology: the descendant of Old Borlish veðerdon "payment, reward", which comes from synonymous widerdōnum in Medieval Latin. This is a borrowing from Germanic (cf. Old English wiþerlēan "recompense", literally "counter-reward"), which the second part calqued as Latin dōnum "gift". Compare the Old French cognate guerredon "payment; spoils, booty, loot", whose first element was also adjusted to guerre "war". Conflation with unrelated Borlish veðr < Latin vitrum "glass" may have influenced the traditional concept of a trophy as made of glass or crystal.
