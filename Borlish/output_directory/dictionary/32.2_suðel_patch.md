32.2: suðel "patch"

suðel /siˈðɛl/ [sɪˈðɛw]
- patch, small piece of fabric used to mend an article of clothing;
- workaround, kludge, hack, a temporary repair intended to be of use for a limited time until a more lasting solution can be found
- plaster, an adhesive piece of material used to cover a wound

Etymology: inherited via Old Boral from Latin sūtēla "a sewing together, a cunning stratagem" (the second metaphorical sense having been lost already in post-Classical Latin). This is a nominal derivation from the verb suō "I sew, I stitch".

    Com suðel eu nos y fenestr zachettað ne closið.
