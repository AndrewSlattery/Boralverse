amaçgat ðescant /ˌa.matsˈgat ðɛˈxant/ [ˌa.mɐsˈgat ðɪˈxan(t)]
- breeding ground, fertile ground, epicentre, a place seen as creating large quantities of a stated thing or type of person;
- hotbed, hotspot, an environment that is ideal for the growth or development of something

Etymology: collocation first attested in the late nineteenth century, literally a "nourishing nursery". The noun amaçgat "nursery, childcare" is borrowed via Mostara amazgato "flowerbed; nursery" from Morrove Arabic اَلْمَسْقَى‎ <al-másqa> "seedbed". The adjective is the present participle of ðescar "nourish, feed, fuel", which descends directly from Latin adēscō "I feed, fatten up".
