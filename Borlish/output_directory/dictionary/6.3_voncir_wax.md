6.3: voncir "wax"

voncir /vɔnˈtsɪr/ [vʊnˈtsɪː]
- wax, any oily solid or semisolid substance and usually long-chain organic compounds;
- (specifically) beeswax, secreted by bees from which they make honeycomb;
- polish, glaze, shiny protective (especially waterproof) coating, traditionally consisting of beeswax

Etymology: the word appears in various forms in Old Boral—voncer, vounceir "beeswax", among others—and while the second syllable descends unproblematically from Latin cēra "wax, beeswax, honeycomb", the first syllable is of unclear etymology. 

Most accepted (though rather ad-hoc) is the theory that the first syllable derives from Old Engish bēon "bees", possibly influenced in its first consonant by Old Boral aveȝle "bee" < Latin apicula "little bee". Less likely is compounding with a hypothetical Old Boral word *awon /awˈvɔn/ "beehive", which could descend regularly from a Latin *alvō, alvōnis, an unattested declension variant of alvus/alveus "hollow, cavity, beehive".
