25.2: scon stemn "second (cousin)"

scon stemn /xɔn ˈste.mn̩/ [xɔnˈstɛ.mɐn]
- (in the phrase cosvour scon stemn) second cousin, familial relation of sharing a single pair of great-parents;
- unprototypical, non-central, being only technically a member of some reference class

Etymology: literally "second lineage"; the adjective scon derives directly from Latin secundus "second" with some irregular reduction (to wit, sporadic loss of the pretonic vowel), while the noun stemn reflects Old Boral stemn "(plant) stem, sapling", from the synonymous Old English stemn. In metaphorical usage, seen from the sixteenth century.
