150.3: bucol "idyll"

bucol /biˈkɔl/ [bɪˈkɔl]
- idyll, haven, paradise, solace, oasis, a peaceful location or circumstance especially in the countryside;
- respite, break, relief, lull, a (usually temporary) decrease in stress or difficulty;
- reverie, daydream, idle and pleasant thoughts

Etymology: Middle Borlish, a backformation from earlier adjective bucolic "idyllic, peaceful", a borrowing from Latin bucolicus "pastoral, rustic". The word had broadened from the first senses by the late eighteenth century, and has been used for purely mental peace since the early twentieth.
