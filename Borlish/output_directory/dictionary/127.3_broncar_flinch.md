127.3: broncar "flinch"

broncar /brɔnˈkar/ [bʀʊŋˈkɐː]
- flinch, wince, recoil, to reflexively move away from something perceived as unpleasant or a threat;
- stumble, trip, slip, lurch, to make a sudden unsteady movement;
- balk, back out, chicken out, get cold feet, to refuse to act due to (espeecially sudden) fear or uncertainty

Etymology: from Old Borlish broncar "stumble, misstep", cognate with synonymous bronchier in Old French but of unknown further origin. Perhaps connected to Latin broccus "buck-toothed" or truncus "docked, cut off", but neither is particularly semantically tempting. Unhelpful also are the equally unsourceable examples of Lombard bronco "thorny branch" and Barcelon bronc "knot in wood".
