Etymology: The verb enombrar is a sixteenth-century borrowing from Latin ēnumerō "I count up, I reckon", based on existing noun nombr < Latin numerus "number". Military use dates from the Democratic Wars of the mid-eighteenth century. The adjective corporal "material", a Middle Boral borrowing from Latin corporālis "physical, concrete", is from the eighteenth century used as a noun meaning "chemical element".
