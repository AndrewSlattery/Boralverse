155.4: marrenquon "nightmare"

marrenquon /ˌma.rɛnˈkwɔn/ [ˌma.ʀɪŋˈkwɔn]
- nightmare, bad dream, an unpleasant or frightening experience during sleep;
- incubus, a malevolent supernatural entity thought to cause nightmares;
- demon, bugbear, bogeyman, any menacing monster especially as used in stories to frighten children

Etymology: pleonastic compound of Old Borlish marr and enquon, both meaning "nightmare". The former is a loan either from Old French or from a German language, while the latter descends from Latin incubō "nightmare". The extension of this word to other malevolent demonic figures is seen from the sixteenth century.
