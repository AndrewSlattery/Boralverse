119.4: rubic "sporty"

rubic /riˈbɪk/ [ʀɪˈbɪk]
- pertaining to sports;
- sporty, athletic, inclined to physical activity;
- competitive, cutthroat, eager to win against others

Etymology: a 19C backformation (based on analogy to the adjectival -ic ending) from rubicon "sports, athletic activity". This itself is an 18C folk-etymological form (evoking the idiom y Rubicon trasir "to pass the point of no return; to start a fight"), possibly via a French or English language, from Willem Dutch robicong "competition, sport, athletics". This is a compound of rob "fight, contest, brawl" and iken "to be compared, compete".
