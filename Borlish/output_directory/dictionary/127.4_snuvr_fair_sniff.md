127.4: snuvr fair "sniff"

snuvr fair /ˈsnɪvr̩ fer/ [ˌznɪ.vɐ feː]
- sniff, sniffle, snivel, snort, to make an audible inhalation through the nose (especially when the nose is blocked);
- scoff, turn up one's nose, sneer, to react with contempt or scorn

Etymology: verb phrase from snuvr "sniff, snort", itself a derivation from the verb snuvlar, which had become obsolete by the seventeenth century. This descends from Old Borlish isnuvlar, a borrowing from Old English snyflan "to have a runny nose". In the latter sense the phrase is attested from the eighteenth century.
