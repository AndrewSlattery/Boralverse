20.3: y jainç tauger "the long game"

y jainç tauger /i ʒents toˈgɛr/ [ɪˈʝens tʊˈgɛː]
- the long game; long-term strategy or an entire endeavour undertaken with patience;
- the big picture; the bird's-eye view of a situation viewed objectively;
- seeing the forest for the trees; the clarity that comes with a less-invested perspective, not being blinkered by emotional involvement or petty distractions

Etymology: Literally meaning "the upstairs tactic", the phrase is attested from the late nineteenth century during the Good Game period whose politics were reflected in the popular literature.

The noun jainç "tactic, move (in a game), attempt" is an Old Boral nominalisation from verb jair "to cast, throw (as of a die)", from synonymous Latin iaciō (or perhaps directly from a Latin noun iaciēntia "an instance of casting". The adjective tauger "upstairs, (by extension) more general" is a Middle Boral adjectival derivation from noun taug /tog/ "floor, storey, level, layer", a borrowing via Barcelon from Arabic طَبَقَة <ṭabaqa> "layer, stratum".
