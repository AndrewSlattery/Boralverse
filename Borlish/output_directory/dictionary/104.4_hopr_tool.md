Etymology: from Middle Borlish hopr "tool, instrument; equipment, gear", from synonymous hople in Old Borlish. This is a borrowing via Old French from Medieval Latin hopla "gear, equipment; tackle", from Greek ὅπλᾰ • (hópla) "tackle; weaponry". Used for children's toys from the sixteenth century, for laughable people since the eighteenth, and in the last senses from the twentieth.
