112.4: abrangir "include"

abrangir /ˌa.branˈʒɪr/ [ˌa.bʀɐnˈʝɪː]
- include, comprise, comprehend, to consider a part of some set of things;
- span, cover, contain, to extend sufficiently so as to include

Etymology: via Scholastic Latin abrangeō "I include" from Portingale abranger "include", itself of obscure origin. Possibly related to Old French rengier "to line up, form rows", from Frankish (either hring "ring" or ranc "upright"); otherwise perhaps an unconventional descendant of Latin vergō "I bend, am situated".
