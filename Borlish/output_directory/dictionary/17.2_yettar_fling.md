17.2: yettar "fling"

yettar /jɛˈtar/ [ʝɪˈtɑː]
- to cast, toss, fling, chuck, hurl, to throw imprecisely with force or violence;
- to scatter, disperse, strew, pelt, to distribute objects around by throwing them out in a haphazard manner

Etymology: From late Old Boral iatar, ietar, iotar "to throw, to bestow, to offer", of uncertain origin. Likely from Old English, either from ȝéatan "to grant, approve" or ȝéotan "to pour, shed", although the semantics are somewhat tenuous; possibly it was influenced in meaning by Old Boral jaire "to cast, throw" or related Old French jeter "to throw".
