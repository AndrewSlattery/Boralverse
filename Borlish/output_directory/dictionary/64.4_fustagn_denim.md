64.4: fustagn "denim"

fustagn /fiˈstɛjn/ [fɪˈstɛjn]
- denim, a coarse textile usually made of cotton with diagonal ribbing;
- jeans, trousers made of denim fabric

Etymology: from Middle Boral, borrowed from contemporary French fustagne "twilled, coarse fabric", from Medieval Latin fūstāneum or from some Romance cognate. The Latin is of uncertain origin, perhaps related to fūstis "stick, club".
