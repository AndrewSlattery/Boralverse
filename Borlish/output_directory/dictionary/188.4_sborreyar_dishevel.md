sborreyar /ˌsbɔ.riˈjar/ [ˌzbɔ.ʀɪˈʝɐː]
- dishevel, tousle, ruffle, to render (hair, clothes, etc.) untidy or disordered;
- disarray, disorganise, to throw into chaos more generally;
- tangle, entangle, knot, snarl, mat, to mix up (e.g. strands) so that they cannot be easily separated (also metaphorically);

Etymology: early modern Borlish, borrowed from northern dialect. The word is a verbal derivative of rural term borr "tuft, burr, clump", which descends from Latin burra "ragged garment, coarse fragment". The prefix s- < Latin ex- is somewhat pejorative; the verbal ending comes from -idiō in Vulgar Latin.
