69.3: auteç "ownership"

auteç /oˈtɛts/ [ʊˈtɛs]
- ownership, possession, control, having something at one's disposal;
- responsibility, duty, obligation, liability, being able to be held to account for something;
- fault, culpability, being responsible for some state of affairs or some particular occurrence

Etymology: from Old Boral afteç "possession, ownership", used predominated in a legal context and reflecting a parallel formation to synonymous habititia in Medieval Latin: it is a nominal derivation from aft (modern aut), past participle of aeir "to have" (modern aïr). In the latter two senses (it is often difficult to distinguish them in examples) the word is attested from the twelfth century.
