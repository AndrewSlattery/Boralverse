Etymology: noun from irruniscabr "contradictory", itself formed from runir "reunite; reconcile" with the potential suffix -abr and negative suffix ir-, from -ābilis and ir- in Latin. The verb runir comes from Medieval Latin reūniō "I reunite", from ūnus "one". In concrete use describing a particular contradictory thing, the word is attested from the early twentieth century.
