114.2: xivol "waltz"

xivol /ksiˈvɔl/ [ksɪˈvɔl]
- waltz, xivola, a style of dance originating in Vascony during the Long Peace (1770–1815) characterised by triple time and a rapid tempo;
- metaphorically, the state of many people simultaneously carrying out independent tasks and moving around each other without getting in each other's way

Etymology: via French xivole from Vascon xìvola /ˈʃi.vo.la/ "waltz". This itself is a borrowing from the earlier and slightly different Italian dance scivola "waltz, word stressed on the third-from-last syllable", from verb scivolare "glide, slip". This is plausibly a descendant of Latin exsībilō "I hiss forth".

Although the original xivola dance had a rather restrained tempo, the average performance speed of xivola music has greatly increased over time. Xivola is usually conceived of as a crowd dance, in which an entire roomful of people participates.
