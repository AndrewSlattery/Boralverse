158.3: ciscr "squeal"

ciscr /tsɪxr̩/ [ˈtsɪ.xɐ]
- squeal, screech, shriek, a strident high-pitched sound as may be caused by friction;
- a loud, high-pitched animal cry;
- scream, yelp, a high-pitched vocalisaton due to fright or surprise

Etymology: attested in Old Borlish ciscle "shriek", a deverbal from cisclar "to shriek, scream" (now obsoleted by ciscr fair "to do a shriek"). This descends from a synonymous cistulō in Vulgar Latin reflected also in Vascon chillar "creak" and Parisian gicler "spurt". In turn this is presumed to be an alteration of Classical Latin fistulō "I whistle, play the flute" via assimilation or sound symbolism.
