131.4: recuidar "reflect"

recuidar /ˌre.kajˈdar/ [ˌʀe.kɐjˈdɐː]
- reflect, consider, ponder, muse, introspect, think to oneself, to actively think about something or about what one knows;
- deduce, realise, infer, construe, to reach a conclusion by reasoning

Etymology: Middle Borlish coinage derived from cuidar "think, suppose, intend". This descends directly from Latin cōgitō "I think, reflect, have in mind". The extension in Borlish to deduction is attested from the 18th century.
