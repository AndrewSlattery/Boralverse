138.3: pre un cocoro "unexpectedly"

pre un cocoro /pre ɪn ˌko.koˈro/ [pʀe ɪŋ ˌko.kʊˈʀo]
- unexpectedly, without warning, suddenly, abruptly, unannounced, occurring in a way that could not have been predicted;
- all at once, overnight, instantly, in one fell swoop, as a single action with no intervening time in which to interrupt

Etymology: idiom attested from the 16th century, literally "before a cockcrow". The noun cocoro "cockcrow", here used figuratively to denote "first light, daybreak, dawn", is assuredly onomatopoeic in origin (as, ultimately, one assumes coq "cock, rooster" was).
