13.2: hortumesc "filthy"

hortumesc /ˌhɔr.tiˈmɛx/ [ˌhɔː.dɪˈmɛç]
- filthy, muddy, covered with dirt or other unpleasant stuff;
- profane, unholy, vulgar, ritually impure or treating religious matters with disrespect

Etymology: adjectival derivation of noun hortum "filth, profanity", which likely originates in Latin sorditūdō "dirt", itself a nominal derivation of verb sordeō "I am dirty".

The unusual phonetic development can be partially explained. The unproductive ending -tum comes from Vulgar Latin -tūminem, a dissimilated form of -tūdinem (the accusative of -tūdō); see also soltum "loneliness". The shift of initial s > h is less explicable, though some have suggested influence from Borland Celtic.
