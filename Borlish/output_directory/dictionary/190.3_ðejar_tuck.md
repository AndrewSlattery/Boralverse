190.3: ðejar "tuck"

ðejar /ðeˈʒar/ [ðɪˈʝɐː]
- tuck, insert, fit, wedge, stick, lodge, to push into a confined or secure position;
- to place underneath something else;
- ram, shove, to drive with some force;
- compact, compress, to cause to be in a more convenient shape or configuration;
- (reflexive) fold up, curl up, to bend onself and hold onto one's legs; 
- (reflexive) fit, be neat, to be suited to taking up some particular space

Etymology: disputed. The word is often presumed to be a metathetic reflex of Old Borlish (a)ieðar [(a)dʒiˈðar] "ram, drive, push forward". This descends from Latin arietō "strike, batter", a verbal derivative from ariēs "ram; battering ram". However, this verb is last attested over two centuries before the first evidence of ðejar in the Middle Borlish period.

The alternative with the most backing is that the word reflects Latin adiciō "I throw at; I attach, augment", which has semantic and phonetic plausibility, although no intermediate forms are in evidence. Other suggestions, like a first-conjugation variant of Latin adigō "I drive, hurl, compel" or a Norrish [Norse] verb like þjá "force" or þeisa "thrust, rush", have rarely been credited.
