27.4: niaç a fuyo aïr "live in sin"

niaç a fuyo aïr /njats a faˈjo ɛˈjɪr/ [nɪˈʝats a fɐˈʝo ɪˈʝɪː]
- to live in sin, to cohabit as if legally wed without being married;

Etymology: idiom first attested in the nineteenth century, especially in association with otherwise-deviant (or Deviant) behaviours such as blasphemy unpalatable to the mores of the Modest Arrangement. The phrase literally means "to have a robin's nest", presumably in reference to robin's nest-building behaviour (which occurs after they have formed monogamous couples for the mating season).

The noun niaç "nest" is an extension of Old Boral ni, which directly reflects synonymous Latin nīdus; fuyo "robin" is of uncertain origin, with theories ranging from a dialect pronunciation of figl "child" to a hypothetical Kelt etymon related to "sparrow".
