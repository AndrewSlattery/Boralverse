ðescar "feed"

ðescar /ðɛˈxar/ [ðɪˈxɑː]
- feed, nourish, to supply with food;
- fuel, kindle, to supply with fuel so as to keep a fire burning or a machine operating;
- stir up, inflame, aggravate, arouse, to exacerbate a (bad) situation

Etymology: from Old Boral ðescar "to feed, fatten up", inherited directly from synonymous Insular Latin adēscō (in more productive use than in Classical Latin). This is a derivative of noun ēsca "food, fodder, bait, fuel", from which we also have modern Boral esc "bait, lure". Extension from food to fuel and then to metaphorical use is attested early, from the twelfth century.
