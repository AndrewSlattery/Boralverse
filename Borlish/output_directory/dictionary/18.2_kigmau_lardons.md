18.2: kigmau "lardons"

kigmau /kajˈmo/ [kɐjˈmo]
- lardons, diced meat and especially diced pork as used in salads, soups or pies

Etymology: early Modern Boral borrowing from Welsh kigmow /kɪɣmɔw/ "pork" (from Old Welsh cig moh /kig mɔχ/), literally "pig meat", with the particular meaning due to the characteristic savoury handheld pies of the Tallath of Devon.
