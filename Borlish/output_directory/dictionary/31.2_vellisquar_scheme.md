31.2: vellisquar “scheme”

vellisquar /ˌvɛ.lɪsˈkwar/ [ˌvɛ.lɪˈskwɑː]
- to strategise, plan ahead, scheme, to formulate a strategy for action;
- to cheese, finesse, to use a cunning or unsporting tactic to gain an advantage in a game or to evade a problematic situation

also vellisqment /ˌvɛ.lɪskˈmɛnt/ ploy, gambit, strategy; exploit, gimmick, ruse, expedient

Etymology: unexplained phonetic alteration from Middle Boral velliskar “to con, to run a fraudulent scheme”, a borrowing from synonymous Portingale or Leon velliscar which also literally means “to pinch, to nibble”. This verb derives from a Vulgar Latin form vellicicō, a frequentative of vellicō “I pluck, twitch, pinch”.
