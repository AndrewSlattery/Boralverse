143.4: assuvar "meteor"

assuvar /ˌa.siˈvar/ [ˌa.sɪˈvɐː]
- meteor, shooting star, a piece of extraterrestrial rock falling through the Earth's atmosphere;
- meteoroid, meteorite, such a piece of rock before it enters the Earth's atmosphere or after it has landed on the ground;
- harbinger, omen, herald, something that foretells the coming of some person or event (especially something bad)

Etymology: from Scholastic Latin assūvāris "meteor; meteoric", and specifically from the thirteenth-century work Dē Assūvāribus "On Meteoric (Phenomena)". This is a borrowing from Arabic شُهُب • shuhub "shooting stars", plural of شِهَاب • shihāb "blaze, brand; shooting star". In the last senses it reflects a long history of comets and similar celestial appearances being used to foretell the future.
