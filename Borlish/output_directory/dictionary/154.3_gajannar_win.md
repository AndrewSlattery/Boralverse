154.3: gajannar "win"

gajannar /ˌga.ʒaˈnar/ [ˌga.ʝɐˈnɐː]
- win, be awarded, to receive as a prize;
- earn, make, to receive as a wage;
- gain, take, get hold of, to succeed in obtaining;
- conquer, to acquire (territory) by force of arms;
- (dated, slang or poetic) tup, bed, swive, to have sex with

Etymology: presumably (along with noun gajan "victory, triumph") via Old French from a Frankish descendant of Classical German vaethanō "I hunt, pursue". However, the Borlish apparently reflects a Late Latin *vadianō "I win, earn" as opposed to the form *vadaniō which must be the etymon for e.g. Tuscan guadagnare "earn" and Norman wain "win". Attested in the last sense from as early as the fourteenth century.
