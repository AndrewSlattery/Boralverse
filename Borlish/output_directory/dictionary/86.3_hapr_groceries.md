86.3: hapr "groceries"

hapr /ˈha.pr̩/ [ˈha.pɐ]
- groceries, produce, commodities, shop-bought foodstuffs and sometimes other household supplies;
- (loosely) shopping, recently-bought goods that are relatively inexpensive and characteristic of daily or weekly purchases;
- (strictly) fruit and veg, goods which may be bought at a greengrocer's

Etymology: direct descendant of Old Borlish happle "fruit, collectively; yield of a fruit harvest" (since displaced by native frugt < Latin frūctus), borrowed from Old English æppel "apple, fruit; sphere". The appearance of the initial h- is unexplained, but may be a hypercorrection; at this point /h/ was absent in native Borlish vocabulary and was being reintroduced via Germanic loanwords. Its modern sense is influenced by the compound haprman "greengrocer; (later) wholesaler".
