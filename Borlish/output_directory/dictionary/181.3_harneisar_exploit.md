181.3: harneisar "exploit"

harneisar /ˌhar.niˈsar/ [ˌhɐː.nɪˈzɐː]
- equip, wield, take up, wear, to pick up and affix to one's grip or person somehow;
- exploit, use, make use of, utilise, to put to some employment to one's or another's advantage

Etymology: Middle Borlish verbal derivation from harneis "equipment, gear, tackle". This descends via Drengot French from Old Norrish hernest, a compound of herr "army" and nest "provisions". As such, the word was restricted to military contexts until the sixteenth century.
