54.4: trencaç "sharp"

trencaç /trɛnˈkats/ [tʀɪŋˈkas]
- sharp, having an edge which can cut very easily;
- freezing, (of weather) bitterly cold;
- wry, sarcastic, ironic, humorous in a particularly self-aware or deprecating way

Etymology: adjectival derivation from trencar "cut, slice", of uncertain origin. Perhaps from Vulgar Latin *trinicō "I cut in three"; otherwise likely an alteration of Latin truncō "I maim, dismember" under Kelt influence.
