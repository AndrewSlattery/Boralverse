156.2: pengovin "pangolin"

pengovin /ˌpɛn.goˈvɪn/ [ˌpɛŋ.gʊˈvɪn]
- pangolin, any of several species of long-tailed and scaly mammals found in tropical Africa and Asia;
- a particular gambling card game, not dissimilar to bezique or pinochle, which originated in Bengal and became popular internationally during the nineteenth century

Etymology: borrowed into European languages (compare Merch penguin /pɪŋˈgjəwɪn/) in the seventeenth century from Bāsan [Malay] penguwing "pangolin", literally meaning "one who rolls". In the second sense, the word is a calque from Bengal bonoro "pangolin; bezique", apparently named for a deck which featured art of a pangolin on some of the cards.
