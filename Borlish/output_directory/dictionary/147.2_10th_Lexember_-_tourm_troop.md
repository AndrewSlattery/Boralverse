tourm /turm/ [tʊːm]

Etymology: Middle Borlish, via the conflation of contemporary French tourme "troop" and Dutch torem "tower, fort". The former is a borrowing from an Italian descendant of Latin turma "troop, team", while the latter is probably a borrowing from a Romance decendant of Latin turris "tower". As a collective noun it is attested from the sixteenth century for ants and somewhat later for some other animals.
