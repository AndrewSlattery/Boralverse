134.2: govon "hinge"

govon /goˈvɔn/ [gʊˈvɔn]
- hinge, a jointed device that allow the swinging of a door;
- pivot, axle, any thing on which something turns;
- centre of rotation, the point which remains fixed by a turning motion;
- pole, (in astronomy) either of the two points on the Earth's surface that intersect its axis of rotation;
- turning point, critical moment, an instant or decision with significant consequences;
- obsession, passion, fixation, the object of someone's obsessive interest

Etymology: originally in the first sense, the descendant of Old Borlish govon "hinge, tenon, pin". This reflects Vulgar Latin gōfō "nail, peg, dowel", a variant of synonymous gomphus in Classical Latin. The extension to a generic point of rotation (and from there to all other senses) had occurred by the Revitalist period.
