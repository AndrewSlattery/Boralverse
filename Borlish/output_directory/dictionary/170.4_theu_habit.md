Etymology: direct descendant of Old Borlish theu, thau "wont; behaviour", borrowed from synonymous þēaw in Old English. In the last senses the word usually has positive affect, unlike otherwise comparable words like obstinaç "obstinacy". Puns on this word with the name Theo are attested from the eighteenth century, possibly as soon as the words became homophonous in many Borlish dialects.
