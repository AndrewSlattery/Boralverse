97.7: outrcaum "coda"

outrcaum /ˌutr̩.ˈkom/ [ˌu.tɐˈkom]
- coda, finale, a passage of music that brings a movement or piece to a conclusion;
- climax, culmination, the peak of a narrative's action;
- zenith, acme, apogee, pinnacle, peak, the highest point or state of anything

Etymology: seventeenth century coinage in the musical sense, from outr- "beyond, last" < Latin ultra "beyond" and caum "piece of music" < Latin carmen "poem, incantation". The compound has been calqued into other languages, including Merch outsong /ˈəut.sɔŋg/ "coda". In extended use the word is attested from the middle of the nineteenth century.
