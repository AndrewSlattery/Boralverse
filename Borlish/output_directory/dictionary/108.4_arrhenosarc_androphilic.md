108.4: arrhenosarc "androphilic"

arrhenosarc /aˌre.noˈzark/ [ɐˈʀe.nʊˈzɐːk]
- androphilic, characterised by (sexual or romantic) desire towards men or aesthetic appreciation of the male form;
- (male) homoerotic, suggesting or arousing a homosexual desire between men;
- (attributively) beefcake, pertaining to imagery of men presented as sexually desirable

cf. thelusarc "gynophilic, etc."

Etymology: nineteenth century coinage from Ancient Greek, originally used in artistic criticism to discuss current trends in painting and sculpture. The term derives from ἄρρην (árrhēn), Attic variant of ᾰ̓́ρσην (ársēn) "male, masculine", as well as σάρξ (sárx) "flesh, lust". Both gendered forms appear to have been coined at roughly the same time.
