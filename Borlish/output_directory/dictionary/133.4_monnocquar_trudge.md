133.4: monnocquar "trudge"

monnocquar /ˌmɔ.nɔˈkwar/ [ˌmɔ.nʊˈkwɐː]
- trudge, lumber, plod, traipse, to walk heavily or with some difficulty;
- struggle, persevere, to work on a task while finding it difficult

Etymology: first attested in the 18th century; further origin obscure. Attempts to connect the word "monk"—perhaps moigne or monhe from regional French and Portingale dialects respectively—stumble on phonetic grounds (and the proposed semantic connection of a monk's plodding gait is tenuous).

More tempting might be Arabic مَنْهُوك • (manhūk) "exhasuted, spent", although no account of the word's journey to Borlish has been corrobated. Claims of a Novomundine origin also lack convincing evidence. Perhaps simply an onomatopoeic or fanciful coinage.
