139.4: n'eç cahut "separately"

n'eç cahut /nɛts kaˈhɪt/ [ˌnɛs.kɐˈhɪt]
- apart, siloed, segregated, separated from each other into disjoint areas;
- separately, independently, without any communication or collaboration;
- estranged, alienated, no longer speaking to one another (especially after a falling out)

Etymology: idiom attested from the eighteenth century, literally meaning "in cabins". The noun cahut "cabin, dorm, sleeping quarters" is a Middle Borlish borrowing, originally in a naval context, from synonyous caihute in Middle Dutch. This is possibly a portmanteau of Old French cabane and hutte, both meaning "hut, shack".

The Borlish idiom appears roughly contemporaneously with cognate idioms in other languages, such as Merch's in cahutes "independently".
