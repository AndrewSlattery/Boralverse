179.3: çosc "stubby"

çosc /tsɔx/ [tsɔx]
- stubby, notably short and thick;
- shortened, docked, cut short, stunted, made shorter or prevented from growing longer;
- squat, stocky, (of a person) short and solidly built;
- thick, broad, relatively great in extent across its shortest solid dimension

Etymology: adjectival use of Old Borlish noun çosc "stump of a tree", which was a variant (likely borrowed from çoche in Old French) of native cognate çoc "stump". These descend from Vulgar Latin tsucca "stump, trunk", though to come via Gaulish from Classical German stuccas "stick, beam; stump". The word was replaced in its noun use by taisc "stump", possibly from Latin taxeus "made of yew wood".
