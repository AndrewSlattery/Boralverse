196.2: entrjair "interpose"

entrjair /ˌɛn.tr̩ˈʒer/ [ˌɛn.tɐˈʝeː]
- interpose, insert, wedge, jam, tuck, to place between two things or in the midst of something;
- (reflexive) intervene, mediate, to involve oneself in a situation;
- (reflexive) interrupt, interject, pipe up, to say something as an interruption

Etymology: Middle Borlish, from now-archaic jair "throw" and prefix entr- "between" or directly from Latin intericiō "I throw between" (with remodelling after the Borlish words). Nowadays the word is mostly seen in its reflexive senses.
