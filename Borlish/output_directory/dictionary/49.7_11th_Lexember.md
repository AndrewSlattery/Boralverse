stoccadar "lunge forward"

stoccadar /ˌstɔ.kaˈdar/ [ˌsto.kɐˈdɑː]
- thrust, lunge, push, to make an advance with force and especially while wielding a melee weapon;
- advance, assault, to move forward as part of a military operation;
- lobby, campaign, to push for a particular policy proposal

Etymology: verbal derivative from stoccad "a lunge, thrust" either in Middle Boral or in the synonymous French estoccade, estoccader before their adoption into Boral. In either case the noun comes from Italian stoccato "thrust", past participle of stoccar "to thrust (with a sword)", itself from now-obsolete stocco "rapier, shortsword". This noun, which is a borrowing from Dutch stooken "to poke, stab", is reflected in Boral stoc "truncheon, club".
