24.2: sagntroðes "priestess"

sagntroðes /ˌsɛjn.troˈðɛz/ [ˌsɛjn.tʀʊˈðɛz]
- priestess, female cleric, a woman with religious duties and responsibilities and in particular a woman leading a religious service or similar rite;
- (obsolete) the wife of a priest or cleric

Etymology: feminine equivalent of sagntrouð "priest, cleric" attested in the second sense above since the medieval period. The word descends from Old Boral saȝrdouð, saȝ(n)drouð in the same sense; the unetymological -nt- was presumably inserted by analogy with adjective saȝnt < Latin sanctus "sacred, holy". The Old Boral reflects Latin sacerdōs "priest", related to sacer "hallowed, divine".
