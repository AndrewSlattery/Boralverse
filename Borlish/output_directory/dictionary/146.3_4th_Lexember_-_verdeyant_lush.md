146.3: 4th Lexember - verdeyant "lush"

verdeyant /ˌvɛr.diˈjant/ [ˌvɛː.dɪˈʝant]
- verdant, green, lush, abundant with (especially new-grown) vegetation;
- rife, plentiful, abounding, present in large numbers;
- thriving, flourishing, prosperous, successful, characterised by happiness and achievements

Etymology: present participle of verdeyar "become green; flourish; abound", a verbal derivative of vert "green" (or directly from Vulgar Latin virdidiō "I turn green"). Metaphorical extensions parallel those in neighbouring Romance and Germanic languages.
