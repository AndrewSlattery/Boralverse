131.2: liesc bouclant "time loop"

liesc bouclant /ljɛx buˈklant/ [ljɛç bʊˈklant]
- time loop, (in fiction) a period experienced by one or more people repeatedly;
- (by extension) routine, monotonous or repetitive activity such as errands that are done many times with little variation

Etymology: idiom from the late 19th century, literally "looping duration". The noun liesc "term, period, duration" is a Old Borlish deverbal from lejar "stop moving, crash" (the word originally meaning "endpoint"), from Insular Latin laedicō "I hit, collide". The verb bouclar "loop, curl, go in a circle" derives from Old Borlish boucle "loop, bracelet" (modern boucr), via Old French from Latin buccula "chinstrap".

The phrase was first used in the translation of 1882 work Cludor ncar Vantel "A Postman in Wrexham", which features such a time loop.
