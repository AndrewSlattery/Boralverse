89.2: yeul ovart "thoroughfare"

yeul ovart /jawl oˈvart/
- thoroughfare, highway, main street, a major road especially conceived as connecting two towns or district
- (computing) a high-speed network connection

Etymology: collocation first seen in the sixteenth century, literally meaning "open street". The adjective ovart "open, public" descends from Vulgar Latin opertus, alteration of Classical apertus "open". The noun yeul "street, wide road" reflects Old Borlish ieol "unpaved road" (as opposed to vei "paved road"), which given Welsh heol "route, passage" is presumably of Borland Kelt origin. In the latter sense attested from 1977.
