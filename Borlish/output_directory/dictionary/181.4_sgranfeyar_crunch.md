181.4: sgranfeyar "crunch"

sgranfeyar /ˌsgran.fiˈjar/ [ˌzgʀaɱˈfjɐː]
- crunch, crush, to put pressure on and thus cause to make a diffuse noise of breaking;
- grind, pulverise, to reduce to small pieces with noise and often violence;
- munch, chew, chomp, to eat noisily

Etymology: seventeenth century, derived from the root gran "grain, seed" with the somewhat-pejorative prefix s- < Latin ex- "out" and the factitive suffix -feyar < Latin -ficō "I make". The word was first used to refer to eating a century after its first attestation.
