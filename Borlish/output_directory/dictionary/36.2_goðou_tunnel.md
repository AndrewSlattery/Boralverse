36.2: goðou "tunnel"

goðou /goˈðu/
- tunnel, an artificial underground or undersea passage through which vehicles may travel;
- flue, chimney, a pipe or duct that directs air or other gaseous products;
- subway, underpass, an underground walkway along which foot traffic moves

Etymology: a late Middle Boral borrowing from Norman gothove /goˈðuv/ "tunnel, passageway", itself via other European languages from Vascon godova /ˌgo.ðuvɐ/ with the same meaning. This reflects Welsh gυoðva "burrow, warren; tunnel", locative derivation of gυoð "mole".

Extended use in the sense of "chimney, flue" is widespread through nearby languages. The word has also been borrowed into Merch and has undergone folk etymology, becoming gothrow /ˈgu.ðɹə/ as though a univerbation of "go through".
