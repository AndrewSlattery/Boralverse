libar /liˈbar/ [lɪˈbɐː]
- sip, nurse, to drink slowly;
- quaff, imbibe, swig, to drink a mouthful of;
- absorb, take up, suck up, (of a substance or object) to take in (a fluid);
- take in, contemplate, appreciate, to consider or to enjoy experiencing;
- (uncommon, religion) to offer a libation, to pour out a liquid as a sacrifice to a deity

Etymology: borrowed from Latin lībō "I taste, sip; I offer a libation". Extension to metaphorical drinking is attested from the eighteenth century. In the last sense, a backformation or reborrowing from Latin which is much less common than the synonymous phrase libaçon fair "to offer a libation".
