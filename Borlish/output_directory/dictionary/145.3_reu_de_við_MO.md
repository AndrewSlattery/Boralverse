145.3: reu de við "MO"

reu de við /rau de vɪθ/ [ʀau dɪˈvɪh]
- lifestyle, way of life, a style of living (especially when reflective of one's culture);
- career, calling, occupation, profession, the field in which one works;
- MO, modus operandi, the things one typically does (and which enable people to predict one's actions)

Etymology: idiom attested in Borlish since the fifteenth century, adapted from slightly earlier Latin rīvus vitae "stream of life". Originally in the earlier senses; extended to general predictable behaviours via law enforcement in the nineteenth century.
