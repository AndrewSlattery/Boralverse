149.4: 26th Lexember - scop "idea"

scop /xɔp/ [xɔp]
- aim, end, purpose, point, goal, what something is intended to achieve;
- crux, heart, gist, essence, thrust, pith, the central idea of a longer or more complicated matter;
- idea, conceit, a summary of the novel part of a piece of fiction

Etymology: Middle Borlish borrowing from Tuscan scopo "purpose, point", which descends from Latin scopus "target". This was borrowed from σκοπός • skopós "watcher; target" in Ancient Greek. The second sense is attested from the seventeenth century; the last only in literary criticism of the twentieth.
