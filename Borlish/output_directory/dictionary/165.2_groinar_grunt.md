165.2: groinar "grunt"

groinar /grɔiˈnar/ [gʀʊiˈnɐː]
- oink, grunt, snort, to make the sound of e.g. a pig;
- growl, snarl, (of an animal) to make a deep rumbling sound;
- grumble, scoff, (of a person) to make a similar such sound to indicate disapproval or scorn

Etymology: from Old Borlish groȝnar, groȝndir "grunt", reflecting Vulgar variants of Classical Latin grunniō "I grunt". To describe sounds made by people the word is attested as early as the Old Borlish period. The expected modern spelling grognar was once sporadically used but may have been avoided on aesthetic grounds (compare genoil "knee" < genoȝl in Old Borlish).
