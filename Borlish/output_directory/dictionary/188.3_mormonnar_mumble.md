188.3: mormonnar "mumble"

mormonnar /ˌmɔr.mɔˈnar/ [ˌmɔː.mʊˈnɐː]
- mumble, mutter, murmur, to say quietly and indistinctly;
- burble, babble, gurgle, to make the speech-like sounds of an infant;
- glug, flow, trickle, bubble, to make the sound of noisily flowing water

Etymology: late Middle Borlish, an onomatopoetic formation (along with contemporaneous mormonment "(a) mumble") allied with Latin murmurō "I murmur" and Parisian marmotter "to mutter". The word had extended to similar non-speech sounds by the end of the eighteenth century.
