137.2: reunç dy blad "roll of the dice"

reunç dy blad /raunts di blad/ [ʀauns di blad]
- roll of the dice, coin flip, shot in the dark, gamble, a risky or uncertain attempt at doing something;
- chance, opportunity, a time when one can try something (especially when one didn't expect to be able to do so)

Etymology: idiom attested from the eighteenth century, literally "flip of the card" and taken from gambling jargon. The word reunç "flip, inversion, return" is a noun from reuvr "come back, turn over", which descends directly from Latin revolvō "I roll over, I repeat". The word blad "playing card" is a borrowing from Saxon blad "leaf, page; playing card", cognate with blade in English.
