33.3: zantr "zenith"

zantr /ˈzan.tr̩/ [ˈzan.tɐ]
- zenith, the point in the sky directly above a given position or observer;
- the highest point in the sky reached by a celestial body;
- (by extension) pinnacle, apex, acme, the high-water mark of a thing or trend's quality or popularity;
- fever pitch, climax, high drama, a state of extreme excitement or emotional investment

Etymology: borrowed in the Middle Boral period via French and Italian from Medieval Latin zantura, zamtaris et al. "zenith" (seen in various declension patterns but usually feminine in modern descendants). This is borrowed from Arabic
 سَمْت الرَّأْس‎ (samtu r-ra's) "direction of the head", the first part of which comes via Aramaic from Classical Latin sēmita "narrow footpath".
