146.7: 8th Lexember - inquillin "roommate"

inquillin /ˌɪn.kwɪˈlɪn/ [ˌɪŋ.kwɪˈlɪn]
- tenant, lodger, renter, one dwelling in a residence they do not own;
- roommate, dormmate, a person with whom one shares living quarters;
- (crude, euphemistic) bedfellow, bedmate, mistress, a sexual partner one lives with

Etymology: from Latin inquilīnus "sojourner, lodger; inmate", related to incolō "I inhabit". Influenced in sense by the unrelated noun quil "bed" and verb inquillir "embed"; these descend from Latin cubīle "bed, lair, kennel", which is related to cubō "I lie down". The euphemistic sexual sense has a possible citation in the seventeenth century, but is only securely attested in the nineteenth.
