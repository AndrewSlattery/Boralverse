ubictað "ubiquity"

ubictað /ˌi.bɪkˈtaθ/ [ˌi.bɪkˈtah]
- ubiquity, omnipresence, the quality of being everywhere;
- totalism, universalism, ideology characterised by the application of principles uniformly in all contexts;
- Ubiquity, a particular ideology which rose to prominence in the late nineteenth century and defined one pole of global power through the twentieth

Etymology: late medieval borrowing from non-classical Latin ubīquitās "ubiquity", nominal derivation of ubīque "everywhere". Applied in philosophical contexts throughout the Latinate Vetomund from the sixteenth century, and used in particular for Ubiquity (originally as an insult) in 1848, in the translation of lady explorer Poshack Nerwaman's dismissive critique of political developments in Mashick [*Mexico].
