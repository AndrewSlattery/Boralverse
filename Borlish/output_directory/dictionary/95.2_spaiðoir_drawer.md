95.2: spaiðoir "drawer"

spaiðoir /speˈðɔir/ [spɪˈðɔ.jɐ]
- drawer, compartment, an open-topped box that one can slide in and out of the cabinet that contains it;
- (figuratively) category, pigeonhole, box, one of several groups of things or people categorised by some means

Etymology: sixteenth-century derivative of verb spaiðar "slide, scrape" with the locative suffix -oir, which comes from -tōrium in Latin. The verb is an Old Borlish derivative of paið "floor, smooth surface", which directly reflects Latin pavītum "beaten, trodden upon" from paviō "I beat, ram, tread down". In figurative use the word is seen from the late eighteenth century.
