67.3: stovir "be necessary"

stovir /stoˈvɪr/ [stʊˈvɪː]
- (archaic or elegant) be necessary, be needed, be obligatory, to be logically or legally required;
- lack, be missing, to (potentially) suffer from not having;
- be wanted, be desirable, to be desired by someone

Etymology: from Old Boral istover "be necessary", a verbal derivation of istof "obligaton, necessity, need". This is a univerbation of Latin phrase est opus "there is need". The shift to less urgent wants is relatively recent, occuring over the course of the nineteenth century. Stovir still connotes stronger desire than the alternative construction desirar "to want" (colloquially 'sirar), which sees more use for polite requests.
