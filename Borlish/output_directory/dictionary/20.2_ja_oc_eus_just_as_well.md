20.2: ja oc eus "just as well"

ja oc eus /ʒa ɔk awz/ [ˈʝa.ʊˈgawz]
- just as well, (it's) all for the best, it could have been worse, phrase expressing encouragement about one's apparently unfortunate circumstances

Etymology: like many such idioms beginning with 'ja...', attested from the late Middle Boral period in various iterations; the first known use in its modern form comes from playwright Joðeg Patrac's 1602 work Dardan e Saugflour (Burdock and Elderflower).

Literally meaning "still this would have gone", its components each descend comfortably from Latin: ja "still, ever" from adverb iam "already", oc "this" from synonymous hoc, and eus "would have gone" from third person singular pluperfect subjunctive form īsset of eō "I go" (with influence from the indicative īvit for the vowel). Conventionally the idiom is followed by neðan "lest, so that … not" when used to start a full sentence.
