162.2: glouç "giggle"

glouç /gluts/ [gluts]
- cluck, gobble, the sound made by poultry;
- giggle, snicker, titter, a high-pitched and silly sort of laugh;
- (interj.) pah, pshaw, faugh, a noise of derision or incredulity

Etymology: Middle Borlish deverbal from now-obsolete gloçar "cluck; chuckle" (now usually glouç fair "to do giggles"). This reflects Vulgar Latin glōciāre "to cluck", a regularised conjugation class variant of synonymous glōcīre in Classical Latin. As an interjection the word is attested from the eighteenth century and is now somewhat old-fashioned or facetious.
