82.3: cas sar "online"

cas sar /kaz sar/ [kɐsˈsɑː]
- online, available over or accessed via the Internet;
- cyber-, pertaining to the Internet or to activities conducted on the subject of or via the Internet

Etymology: phrase first attested in the 1980s, from the preposition cas "pertaining to, on the subject of, at the home of, with respect to, when it comes to" (via Old Boral cas from Latin casa "house") and the noun sar "fishnet, mesh, network" (from the synonmous Vask). The noun sar in this usage ("the Internet") is shortened from the phrase sar pistol "lit. the message mesh", itself translating Roun French mail pistre /maʒ piːtə/ in the same sense. This was first used in 1968 work of fiction Starsail, by Ashford Pasquier.
