vabiantað "misery"

vabiantað /ˌva.bjanˈtaθ/ [ˌva.bjɐnˈtah]
- misery, woe, distress, wretchedness, a state of great unhappiness characterised by physical or mental affliction;
- ruin, decrepitude, disrepair, the condition of being utterly worn out or destroyed from long use or disuse;
- (archaic or legal) bankruptcy, insolvency, inability to meet one's financial obligations

Etymology: Middle Boral-era nominalisation of now-obsolete vabian "woeful, disconsolate", coming via synonymous Old Boral vabȝan from Old English from Old English wābegān, literally "beset by woe". In the last sense it is attested generally from the fourteenth century until the eighteenth, and in specialised use thereafter.
