150.4: coyol "cone"

coyol /kɔˈjɔl/ [kʊˈʝɔl]
- (geometry) cone, the surface formed by rotating a deflected line segment around its end (or the solid thus circumscribed);
- anything conical;
- spire, point, a tapering structure built to cap a roof or tower;
- acme, zenith, peak, cap, summit, the best or highest-quality type of something;
- cap, coif, bonnet, a piece of headgear covering the top and sides of the head

Etymology: via Old Borlish coȝol "hood; cone" from Latin cucūlla "hood, cowl; conical wrapper or case". Used consistently to translate Scholastic Latin cōnus "cone" in geometrical texts since the fourteenth century (possibly the unrelated con "with" discouraged directly borrowing that Latin). In the modern language restricted to detached headgear that is at least vaguely conical.
