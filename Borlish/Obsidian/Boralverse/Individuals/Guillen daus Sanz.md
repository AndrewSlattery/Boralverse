Guillen daus Sanz (b. ca. 1450, [[Provincial]] /giˈʎẽj daus sɐ̃ts/) was a strategist in [[Provence]] in the years leading up to the [[War of Provincial Independence]], and became a powerful political figure in the decades afterward.

Born a foundling (the surname *daus Sanz* "of the Saints" was widely given to children in orphanages at the time), he joined the (then-Burgund) army at a young age and rose to the position of general after receiving the patronage of [[Daniel Menton]], Lord Amigòt.

It was on the advice of daus Sanz that Lord Amigòt was able to secure the aid of King [[Marc V of France]]; [[France]] had reconciled with [[Normandy]] to avoid the tangle that was the [[Albion]] [[Wars of Fealty]]. With this support, he and several other noble families declared independence from [[Burgundy]] on the twenty-first of June, 1497 (which to this day is a national holiday in Provence).

The following quote is popularly attributed to daus Sanz on the eve of the [[Battle of Margès (1499)]]. It mocks the states of Albion which had been embroiled in the Wars of Fealty for the past two decades.
> Perhaps we should have sent for a Kentish witness! They might learn the subtle craft of ending the wars they start.

After Daniel Menton's rule over independent Provence ended in 1517, his cousin Antoin was elected by the Concert under the close attention and martial guidance of daus Sanz.

Fort daus Sanz, a military base in Provence in active use during the mid-twentieth century, was named for Guillen daus Sanz.
