Dewock Barclythe (1452-1539 N) was the Friar of [[Tremonnow]] and for several decades the prime Factor of Records at the [[Brethin]] House there. Records of his correspondence with clergy and academics across western Europe have survived to the present day. These include some of the earliest attestations of dart geometry, and thus the beginnings of the unification of geometry and computation.
