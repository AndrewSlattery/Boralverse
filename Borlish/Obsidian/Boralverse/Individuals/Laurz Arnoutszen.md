Laurz Arnoutszen (fl. 1540) was a Danish physician whose work in sanitation shaped the course of European medical history, to such an extent that in the context of medicine one can speak of pre-Arnoutszen and post-Arnoutszen [[Europe]] (although this periodisation can go too far in neglecting others' advancements and successes prior to his work).

At some point after 1535 he collaborated with his cousin [[Elisa Arnoutszen]]. His son was also pivotal in the history of medicine, being partially responsible for the discovery of one-case life.

His great treatise on medical handiwork and other practice included recommending the employment of distilled lembick as liquid diffruction.
