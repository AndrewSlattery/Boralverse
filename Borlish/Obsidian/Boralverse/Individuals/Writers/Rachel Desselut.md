Rachel Desselut (fl. 1743) was a French philosopher. She is best remembered for her 1743 work *[[The Parable of the Mute Bookbinder]]*, which discusses problems of infinite regression and of identity.

She was born to [[Maurice Desselut]], eighth Lord Bouvoin, who was a writer and explorer. Fittingly he was also an infamous libertine (the house name Desselut deriving from an Old French word meaning *dissolute, philandering*).

She was the first to lay out in our modern terms the philosophical distinction between Form and Method, which allows an entity to self-replicate (constructing its Form from the Method's instructions, then transcribing the Method blindly). These concepts would go on to be vital in the study of [[Methodics|methodics]] and to general augrimmer practice.

Desselut inferred from her work the existence of a vital language, now known to be composed of heredian acid.
