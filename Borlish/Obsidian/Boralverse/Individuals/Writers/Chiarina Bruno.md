Chiarina Bruno (fl. 1824) was a librettist and composer active in the early nineteenth century, primarily in the aftermath of the [[Second German War]]. Her most enduring work is the opera Wings Afire (**Ali in Fiamme**), an adaptation of the story of Icarus.

Born at her father's estate in western [[Furlain]], she lived in [[Verona]] for most of her adult life. She had a twin brother [[Jacomo Bruno|Jacomo]]; they were noted for their remarkably similar appearance, even for twins.
