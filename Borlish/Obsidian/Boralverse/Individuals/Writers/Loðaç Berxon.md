Loðaç Berxon (b. 1865) led the Borland chapters of the [[Outland Arcabil Association]] from 1913 until 1918. Berxon had emigrated to the capital city of [[Damvath]] from her birthplace in the [[Arcabil]] a decade earlier, due to the disruption of the [[Millstone War]]. She was an established author, best known for her first work L'Askouð Pyrrhaz ([[The Firekeeper's Stronghold]]), published in 1910. The Outland Arcabil Association was a collection of societies working for the benefit of the Arcabil diaspora across the globe.
