Absolon Mortenszen was a playwright and commentator in the [[Dane Concert]] of the sixteenth century. In the year 1560 he was living in [[Alburg]], Denmark.

It is though that his grandfather lost his wife and at least two brothers in the [[Second Great Dying]]. He married a woman named Clara at some point before 1560; they did not have any children. He had a brother who married a woman named Beatrys.

Shortly before 1560 he wrote a play titled '[[High Society]]', which was received so well that the royal family altered the route of their Grand Tour in order to visit Alburg and see a performance.

(Penned the morning of the 18th of March, 1560 Nascentiæ)

To the Good Sir Anscon d'Aupont,

I hope you are well recovered from the ague of which you spoke in your last missive; I need not remind you to consider leaving the city until the bulk of the trading has ended. One never knows what foreign ills merchants may bring, as my grandfather could have attested…

The town remains as dull since you departed as it was before we met, you will be pleased to hear. In point of fact, even the decent lodging-house on the strand is poorer for having banned all the interesting people in town; perhaps it speaks poorly of me that they yet allow me entrance, though I will at least avail myself of the views while I can.

My dear brother (you may remember his shoes) is celebrating the birth of his daughter in the usual way; I continue to be astonished Beatrys consented to marry him, though she has been managing to escape him and the baby often enough to visit myself and Clara. We, you will note, have not yet succumbed to the child-bearing impulses the new friar insists we all harbour within.

There is a new friar at the hostel, less talkative and (if you will believe my wife) less handsome than Daniel. More than anything he reminds me of the moralising mentor one sees in the dreadful morality plays they still show down in the city; he seems the sort to dream of visiting Rome and upon arriving declare it insufficiently Christian! One supposes Lorenzo's new Mechanisms of Helios sculpture about which you droned on at me for hours might send the good man directly into an apoplexy, which would at least be entertaining…

The new play is a mild success, despite the inclement weather rather betraying the fact that Alburg is not, to my regret, Barcelon. Clara has had marvellous fun with the new fabrics and dyes; please accept my sincerest gratitude for the billrod, although it is far too expensive to use regularly.

I leave with you my kindest regards,

A. Mortenszen
