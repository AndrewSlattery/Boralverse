Elsebeth Sneider (m. 1772, d. ~1830, née Siegert) was an author from [[Saxony]] and a pioneer of [[Parachthony|parachthon]] romance in general and [[Voidtale|voidtale]] in particular.

## Life
Elsebeth Sneider was born in [[Lepzi]] to Albert and [[Marian Siegert]] in the early 1750s; her mother died in childbirth when she was a young girl. Her father ran a successful shoemaking industry with several shopfronts in the city.

In 1772 she married Otto Sneider, scholar at the Stercundhaus in Lepzi. She began writing in her forties, publishing her first book in 1795 and releasing regular works until her death.

## Voidtale
Her most successful work was also her first, the 1795 trevold [[Through a Black Mirror]] (**Durgh'nen Shorzen Shower**), which sparked the decades-long voidtale craze. The fashion for voidtale lasted from the turn of the century until the [[Second German War]], at which point its optimistic and exploratory character dropped rather rapidly out of fashion. Sneider's writings usually featured a heap of different xenic worlds and varied peoples, and the long voyages her characters took to explore them.

## Politics
In her later years she campaigned for reform to Saxony's inheritance law, especially with respect to eldest daughters with no brothers; though her more ambitious goals were ultimately unsuccessful within her lifetime, the political society she founded would go on to spearhead suffrage movements in Saxony, [[Denmark]], and across the Latin republics. 

She also wrote against the nascent [[Deviance movement]], despite her works' popularity with its adherents; in an 1821 letter to her sister she wrote:
    “It is not only their strange ideas and lonely, nihilist universe, dear Thifäne, but that so many of their number have approached me as if I were their most natural ally!”
The fervency of her opinion was visible in her later works, which have a decidedly theological bent.
