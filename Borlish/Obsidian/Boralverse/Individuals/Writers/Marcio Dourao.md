Marcio Dourao was an author and rabblerouser best remembered for his work [[Galatheus, or the Knowledge of Good and Evil]]. This collection of short stories pastiching Greek mythology was written in 1930 during the decade-long [[Portingale Anarchy]]. The title references the story of Galatea and Pygmalion. Galatheus was banned in neighbouring [[Vascony]] and [[Morrack]] for its background politics and, unofficially, for its throughline of gender exploration; neither polity had quite forgotten their roles in the traditionally-minded [[Modest Arrangement]] of the previous century.
