David Bensaíd (fl. c18) was a writer and political philosopher from [[Vascony]]. He is best known for his treatise on statecraft '[[The Three Cities]]', which was translated into over twenty languages.

In his treatise he intrduced the terms **nohase** 'copperplate' and **casdír** 'tinplate', adapted from the factions which arose in the court of Malik [[Hisham Ar-Rashid of Libya]].
