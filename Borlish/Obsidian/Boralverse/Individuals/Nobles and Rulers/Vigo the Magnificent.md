Vigo the Magnificent (d. 761) was king of the Britons in [[Gaul]] (and later of [[Kingdom of Greater Devon|Greater Devon]]) from 720 N until his death.

He ascended to the position upon the death of his mother Queen [[Maud of Anzeus]], who as a widow had unified the Kernish kingdoms. This was (in 720) shortly after the [[Catumagin Accords]] with the [[Kingdom of the Franks]] to the east, which ended hostilities and established an official border between the kingdoms.

King Vigo is remembered primarily for leading the reconquest of [[Devon]], which had been de jure under Wessern authority since the final defeat of the West Albick Britons at [[Gaulford]] in 656 N (although the more remote parts of the peninsula are thought never to have entirely submitted).

The reconquest of Devon spanned over two decades of intermittent fightning with [[Wessex]] and concluded with the victory at [[Petherton]] in 749 N. With this victory Vigo was crowned rex Magnæ Dumnoniæ "King of Greater Devon", unifying Devon with [[Kernow]].

He married [[Guinnumar]], daughter to King [[David I of Guineth]], in ca. 725 N. This marriage is likely what allowed him to secure Welsh assistance with the invasion. With her he had at least three children, including his son [[Cadern the Doubter]] (who would become king upon Vigo's death in 761) and his daughter [[Iseld of Devon]], who later became the first patron of the [[Brethin]] of [[Tremonnow]].

His prominence in the genesis of the kingdom lead to many of his royal descendants taking his name, including [[Vigo IV of Greater Devon|Vigo IV]] (crowned 940), who conquered east to Anzeus, and [[Vigo VII of Greater Devon|Vigo VII]] (fl. 1121).
