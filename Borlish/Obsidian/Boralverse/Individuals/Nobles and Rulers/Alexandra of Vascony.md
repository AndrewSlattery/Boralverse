Princess Alexandra (fl. 1471, known also as *Sandra*) was the elder sister of King [[Ambrose III of Vascony]]. She is principally remembered for being the first Vetomundine royal to set foot in the [[Novomund]].

The chemical sandrine is named for her, due to her voyage advancing the understanding of the counter-scurvic effect of sandrine-rich foods like citrus fruits.

Alexandra was married at least twice; her second marriage began (and had issue) during the [[Wars of Fealty]] but before her famed voyage.

## Family
Alexandra was the eldest child of [[Mark of Tolose]] and [[Margaret of Iscombe]], born not long before 1435. She had two brothers: [[Ambrose III of Vascony]] and [[Victor of Astorga]], and a sister Natalie.
