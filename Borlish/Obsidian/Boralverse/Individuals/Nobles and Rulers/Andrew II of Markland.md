Andrew II (fl. 1301) was a martial-minded king of Markland in the early fourteenth century. He succeeded his uncle, who is remembered as being far more diplomatic. Andrew II oversaw the [[Sack of Rexam]] in 1301, an act which reignited the on-again off-again conflict between Markland and Wales known as the [[Mallor Wars]]. The original medieval building at St Brigid's Abbey was razed during this offensive.
