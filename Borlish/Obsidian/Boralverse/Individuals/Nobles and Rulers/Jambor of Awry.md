Jambor of [[Awry]] (fl. c12) was an early king of Awry following the state's succession from the principality of the century before. He oversaw significant expansion of Mojarick influence, entering into personal union with eastern principalities such as Halich and Valack, and becoming an ally of the Malchassian Romans to the south.

The great [[Library of Sobjan]] was built during his reign, an enduring gravatory of contemporary works. These included mathematical texts from the [[Single Caliphate]] which were at that time being translated into Latin in great quantities.

Centuries later, one of the Library's manuscripts was instrumental in decoding the famed [[The Mysarnos Codex|Mysarnos codex]].
