Brenna of Barrow (fl. 898) was the niece of King [[Roderick of Dunclothe]]. She married the young King [[Jothey of Borland]] shortly before the [[Borland#First Kingdom of Borland|First Kingdom of Borland]] fell to the Danes in 898. Subsequently she fled with her husband to [[Southbar]], where she bore several children.

Two decades later Sothbar surrendered to [[Borland#Dane-ruled Borland|Dane Borland]] and the family were forced to flee once more, this time to [[Kent]]. Much of our knowledge of the remainder of her life is preserved through the [[Brethin]] copies of her correspondence with her aging uncle in [[Dunclothe]].
