David (fl. 1590) was king of [[France]].

David was dogged by rumours that he was the son of Duchess [[Adaillé Nassow, Duchess d'Avosche|Adaillé d'Avosche]] from before his accession to the throne until his death; her influence on his court was noted and derided by contemporary commentators.

Shortly after a scandal involving the Duchess in 1589, David gained more political independence and (inspired by parallel developments across [[Europe]]) began to institute centralisation policies in France, increasing his own power at the expense of his ducal and comital vassals.
