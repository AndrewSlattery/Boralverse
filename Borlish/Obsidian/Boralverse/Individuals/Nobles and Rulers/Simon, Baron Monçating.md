Lord Simon, the sixth Baron Monçating (b. 1770) was an intellectual, a notorious libertine of the [[Damvath]] melee, and an early proponent of [[Deviance Theology|Deviance movement]] in [[Borland]]. He was of [[Warnine]] descent through his mother. His family had been notorious for decades due to a protracted legal battle between his father and second cousin over the Barony of [[Haubrath]]. By the age of eighteen Simon could speak Latin, Dutch (and according to his defamers, Warnine), and he could play the clavier and the torriot.
