Ambrose II (cr. , d. 1455) was king of [[Vascony]].

His eldest son and heir was [[Mark of Tolose]], who died in 1453, causing the throne to pass to Ambrose's grandson, [[Ambrose III of Vascony|Ambrose the Ascendant]], after his death.

His death caused the [[Sapling Crisis]] (**Avalot Planzo**), a brief but bloody succession crisis from which the aforementioned grandson emerged the victor.
