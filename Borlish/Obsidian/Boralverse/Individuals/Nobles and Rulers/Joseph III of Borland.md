Joseph III (d. 1534) was king of [[Borland]], remembered for ruling the kingdom through the ravages of the [[Second Great Dying]].

Joseph never succeeded in producing a natural-born heir, despite several recognised yet illegitimate children by his various mistresses. Thus, after his death in 1534, he was succeeded to the throne by [[Brandon II of Borland|Brandon II]], his nephew.
