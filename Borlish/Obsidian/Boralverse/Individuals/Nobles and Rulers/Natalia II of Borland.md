Natalia II (Borlish **Natagl**, abd. 1894) was the last queen of [[Borland]] before the dissolution of the monarchy. She abdicated on [[Revillon]] of 1894 during the political upheaval leading to the country joining the [[Drengot Collusion]] (several Borlish cities, although not the capital, had already joined as part of the [[New Urban Mesh]]).
