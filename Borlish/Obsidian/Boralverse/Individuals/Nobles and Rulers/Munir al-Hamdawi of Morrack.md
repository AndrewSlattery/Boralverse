Munir al-Hamdawi (b. 1429) was the ruler of [[Morrack]] during the latter half of the fifteenth century.

He had a long-standing rivalry with [[Ambrose III of Vascony]], which grew from a childhood enmity to a bitter naval and martial feud.

His reign included the conquest of the southern parts of [[Portingale]] in 1457 N, which had previously enjoyed a level of autonomy under Vascon stewardship.

In 1463 Munir established the [[New World Company]] (شركة العالم الجديد) as a rival marine enterprise to Ambrose's [[New Navarre Enterprise]]; five years later the ship Orion (الجَبَار) of this company circumnavigated [[Africa]].
