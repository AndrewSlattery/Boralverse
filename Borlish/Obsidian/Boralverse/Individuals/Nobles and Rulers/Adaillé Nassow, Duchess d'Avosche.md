Adaillé Nassow (1524–1608) was duchess of [[Avosche]], a duchy in southern [[Willemy]], for much of the sixteenth century and the start of the seventeenth.

Adaillé was born to [[Roger d'Avosche]] and his wife Caroline in 1524, the third of eight children. Her two elder brothers died in infancy (at least one in the [[Second Great Dying]]), as well as her younger brother Peter, and her youngest sister Anne.

She was raised in early childhood by her nurse [[Elisa Arnoutszen]], cousin (and, later, coauthor) of the renowned physician [[Laurz Arnoutszen]]. During this time Adaillé was noted for her inquisitive and intelligent nature.

She was infamous during her later life for her great influence in the court of [[David of France]]. Rumours that she was his mother circulated from before his accession until his death.

In 1589 her grandson and heir apparent Déricque caused a scandal by running away from court and very publicly announcing his intentions to flee to [[New Provence]] in the [[Novomund]] (which he subsequently did).
