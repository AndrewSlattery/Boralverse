A tachygraph (Merch /ˌta.kɪˈgɾaf/, also informally a **tachy** or **tacky** /ˈta.kəi/) is a device with a keyboard for typing text onto paper, or more recently directly onto a slate.
## Etymology
The word "tachygraph" originates in the mid-nineteenth century as a brand name. It is derived from Ancient Greek τᾰχῠ́ς • (takhús) "quick, fast" and γρᾰ́φω • (gráphō) "draw, write".
## History
Early tachygraphs in the 1830s and 40s were extremely cumbersome, with most models only capable of setting type at a fraction of the speed of practised handwriting. The Armanburg Tachygraph (*Tachygrafia Armangrod*), which was commercially available in [[Poland]] from 1842, was so awkward to use that it was lampooned in the bit-sheets as the *Bradygrafia* (literally the “slow-writer”).

Since very early on, attempts have been made to connect tachygraphs to the [[Steeplepost|steeplemesh]], so that one could type a message onto paper and simultaneously transmit a copy of the message to someone else (ideally, automating a tachygraph to type the message out also on the receiving end).

The first tachygraph specifically able to send messages on the steeplemesh was the Vilmanas Teleclavia, designed in [[Lithow]] by [[Tomas Vilmanas]] in 1859. Its first message (the first line from Ovid's *Heroines*, reproduced below) was sent on Michaelmas of that year to his friend [[Margreta Legaite]] in Tvaniste.

> · A B C D E F G · HAEC TUA PENELOPE LENTO TIBI MITTIT ULISSE ·
> a b c d e f g. This your Penelope sends to you, long-delayed Ulysses.

Historical films have made much of the fact that this message was sent less than a month after the [[1859 Auroric Anomaly]], but there is no evidence Vilmanas considered its effects (though he must have been aware of the stories of messages along unpowered steeplepost wires).

In the late nineteenth century, the *Faxim* brand of tachygraph was sold across [[Borland]].
