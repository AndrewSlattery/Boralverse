The **dime measures** (less commonly known as the 'tithe measures' or 'tenth measures') are a modern system of units based on factors of ten. The name derives from the French *dîme* "one-tenth", from synonymous *decimus* in Latin.

The dime measures were codified during the nineteenth century for ease of communication as theoretical development coalesced into a global endeavour. They have been updated several times since, as it has become feasible to use more convenient yardsticks.

Standard modifiers may be added to each unit to increase or decrease their size by factors of 10⁴. In most common use are:
- great (10⁴)
- tithe (10⁻¹)
- petty (10⁻⁴)
- scant (10⁻⁸)
## Length
There are three bases for dime lengths: the *inch*, the *foot* (10 inches) and the *league* (10⁴ feet). At first, the length of the foot was fixed somewhat arbitrarily as the midpoint of the very slightly discrepant Roman foot and the Cathayan "surveyor's span". In 1946, the foot was redefined to make the normal speed (denoted *œ*) precisely ten great leagues per second.

Several other traditional measures of length were given dime values. For instance, the dime *mile* is equal to five thousand feet or half a league.
## Heft
There are four bases for dime hefts: the *scruple*, the *ounce* (100 scruples), the *tabre* (100 ounces) and the *ton* (100 tabres). The third of these units takes its approximate value from the Persian *mann* and its name from the city of Tabris. The ounce was originally defined to be the mass of a cube of water of side length one inch; this was later refined to specify that the water be at its triple point of pressure and temperature.
## Derived units
Many units are defined in terms of these base units of length and heft, as well as the second. For example, the *shove* measures the might required to give a heft of one tabre an acceleration of 1 foot per second per second.
