The **pistol mesh** (Borlish *sar pistol*), also referred to simply as the **mesh**, is the global system of long-distance communication which employs a single normalised method for transmitting messages from one endpoint [[Grimmer|grimmer]] to another.

## Etymology
The phrase "pistol mesh" (in the Roun French form *mail pistre*) was first used by writer Ashford Pasquier in his 1968 parachthon work *Starsail*, describing technology that could transmit written messages, sounds and moving images between people in different star systems.

The phrase literally means "network for messages": the word *pistol* reflects post-Classical Latin *pistola* "epistle, written decree", aphæretic form of synonymous *epistola*; the word *mesh* descends from Old English *masc* "net".

## History
The pistol mesh grew out of several earlier technologies, all the way back to the first flag-lamp steeplepost lines in the eighteenth century allowing short texts to be sent between signal towers.

A century later sees the emergence of tachygraphs, devices allowing one to type text directly onto the barric [[Steeplepost|steeplepost]] from the comfort of one's home. However, it was only with the rise of general grimmers in the twentieth century that we start to recognise the modern pistol mesh.  

By the late twentieth century, the pistol mesh was sufficiently mature that whole enterprises could be conducted using it as a medium. For example, at this time the Tremonow Open School (formerly the Brethin Mesh Institute) offered history courses across [[Albion]] entirely via mesh.
