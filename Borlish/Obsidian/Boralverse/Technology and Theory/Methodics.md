Methodics is the field of study pertaining to the discovery, development and improvement of methods. In this scholastic context a method is any series of instructions that may be unambiguously and repeatably followed to produce some result.

# History

For millennia methods were developed sporadically without much awareness of general methodical principles. For example, an early method in the historical record is Euclid's procedure for finding the coarsest scale common to two whole numbers. Later we find methods involving tables of pre-computed values, such as Nadim's Method for multiplication by means of the Trapolitan identity for arrhumb.

Methods with more immediate practical use were continually developed; by the sixteenth century the threepoint method for calculating distances was vital in creating accurate maps for the explorations of the Intertwining Century.

One the first major results in abstract methodics came from the study of life, with Rachel Desselut's 1743 work *Parable of the Mute Bookbinder*, which argued that in order for living matter to duplicate, it must contain within itself an explicit method describing its construction. Although heredian acid would not be discovered for another century, her work accurately predicted the necessary separation of Form and Method that would become the bedrock of the study of heredity.

An increasingly-important category of method from the eighteenth-century onward has been procedures for encrypting text, either to conceal it or else simply to convert it into a suitable form for a given [[Steeplepost|steeplepost]].
