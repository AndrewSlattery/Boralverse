I Macchine di Helio (The Machines of Helios) is a marble sculpture created by [[Lorenzo dell'Acchedia]] in the 1550s, during the regions [[Revitalist period]]. It was carved in Acchedia's workshop in [[Rome]] and displayed in that city for the first decades of its existence. The work is a stylised depiction of the Greek god Helios "the Sun" with the six known planets gyring around him. The notion of a Sun-centred cosmos that inspired the work may have been transmitted to Acchedia via his close friend [[Martèl fi Bacchero]], mathematician at the library of Saint Jerome, who is recorded to have debated the issue in public fora as early as 1552.
