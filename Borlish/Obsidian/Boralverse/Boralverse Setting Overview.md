## The World

The setting I write in (hereafter "Boralverse") is an alternate history of Earth. The original difference from our own history (hereafter "IRL") is the existence of the island of Borland (Istr Boral) between Great Britain and Denmark, inspired by the IRL existence of Doggerland.

### Human Pre-Classical History of Borland

The human pre-classical history of Borland can be summarised as:

- **8,000 years ago**: With sea level rise, Borland was cut off from the continent and from Britain (this is when Doggerland was submerged IRL); some Stone Age people remain. They leave some monuments—burial mounds, the Çadrosc labyrinth—and were farmers, but they had no writing or ironworking.
- **Second millennium BCE**: The Celts arrive in Borland shortly before they settle Britain, taking up iron tools and establishing many tribal groups. Due to some later migration from Britain to Borland, they speak a language (Borland Celtic) which is most closely related to Proto-Brythonic.

### Historical Development

I assume that as far as possible the history of the rest of the world is indistinguishable from the IRL history up to this point. I continue to do so while the Romans invade and settle Borland shortly after Britain, despite conceding to credulity and allowing a few classical references:

> ...in Ptolemy's description of the Pritannoi we can understand he referred to the Insular Kelts of Ireland, Britain and Borland as a whole...

> ...contrasting Hadrian's policies in Britain and in Borland is vital for understanding their different fates in the post-Classical age...

where I admit that the Roman Empire having an entire additional province should probably have some observable effects.

### Historical Divergence

Once the Western Roman Empire collapses, I start properly diverging Boralverse history from IRL history. This begins with a different pattern of Anglo-Saxon migration; the two petty kingdoms of **Angland** and **Southbar** arise in western Borland, while the settlement of England proceeds slightly slower than IRL.

Historical divergence spreads through western Europe over the next few centuries, and by **1000 CE** things are beginning to go off the rails all across Eurasia and North Africa. I leave the history of the Americas the same until Old World contact (via Basque fishermen stumbling across Newfoundland in **1470 CE**), and likewise with Australia.

### Modern Era

In the modern era, my hope is that the Boralverse world feels **fractally uncanny**; at every scale something is unexpectedly different, from political borders and languages to fashion and pop culture references.

For clarity, I employ an inconsistent Translation Convention when writing from a Boralverse perspective, mostly using IRL English but peppering in calques of Boralverse English jargon for flavour, such as:

- **threshold force** — "nuclear power"
- **jalick** — "garment socially equivalent to a tuxedo"

## The Language

The original motivation for this alternate history setting is **Borlish** (Borallesc), the Romance language spoken on Borland.

### Early Development

It picked up a few Borland Celtic loanwords from the existing population at the time of the conquest:

- **macquar** ~ Welsh _magu_ "raise, rear"
- **vrug** ~ Welsh _grug_ "heather"

But was much more influenced through the first millennium by Anglo-Saxon settlement and then Norse conquest during the Viking Age.

### Old Borlish (ca. 1240)

The following is an example of late Old Borlish:

> …sovravnt il deft nostre saȝntaðesem eð atavalesem n iȝ atrevre golfhavn seȝ hamar dont y verb divin ismetre ac povre paian. peðiv soul ez font istovent por vn nov cliȝs d istroienz istablir…

_Translation:_ …uphold our most sacred and ancient duty to let Gulfhaven be the centre from which we will send the Word of God to pagan lands. We ask only for the necessary funds for a new teachinghouse…

### Modern Borlish

The Modern Borlish language has undergone spelling standardisation (most recently deprecated some irregular spellings in 1870), and contains many more Latin and Greek loanwords, along with borrowings from languages across the world.

**Example:**

> Y stal zajadau dy marcað nogtorn accis par lamp fumer eð y lun fragnt de mar receven cos equal party a domn pescour pevr jarras e fenogl gostant tan eð eç nobr robað n'ornament fluibond ant queldin raut frigsað ne papir cerous.

_Translation:_ The night market's various stalls lit by smoky lamps and the sea-shattered moon welcomed flocks of fishwives sampling paprika and fennel as well as notables in flowing finery carrying stir-fried suppers in wax papers.

### Major Linguistic Features

In terms of sound changes and grammatical developments, the major points include:

1. **Intervocalic lenition** /p t k b d g/ > /v ð j ∅ ∅ ∅/:
    - _catēna_ > _caðen_ "chain"
    - _dēbēre_ > _deïr_ "must"
2. **Orthographic conventions**:
    - Use of **ç** (and **c** before e i y) for /ts/
    - Use of **g** in coda to represent /j/
    - Along with some vowel shifts, this leads to things like _cigl_ /tsajl/ "darling"
3. **Total loss of final consonants** in multisyllable words, including -s, which leads to:
4. **Collapse of noun declension**, including number; Borlish does not mark number on nouns, and if it wants to it uses demonstratives or simply relies of verb agreement:
    - _l'oc scuir pasc_ "this boy eats"
    - _l'ec scuir pascn_ "these boys eat"
