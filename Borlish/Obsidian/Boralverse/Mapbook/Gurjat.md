Gurjat is a polity on the western coast of [[India]].

# History
The medieval period saw a flourishing of mathematics across India, and Gurjat was no exception. For instance, the now-familiar angle addition identities for vatre and arrhumb were first noted by the mathematicians of the city of Ujén.

Gurjat was one of the stopping points for the British ship the Phœbos under Captain mac Kellot during its famed voyage in the early sixteenth century. The ship spent several months at port there in 1512, after having circumnavigated [[Africa]] and before continuing on to [[Madray]] and thence to the [[Great Borunesk Meeting]] of 1516.

Gurjat enjoyed a significant trade empire in the seventeenth century, spanning from African ports like [[Ungotia]] and even Vascon-controlled Sant Adrian in the west to [[Cathay]] (and eventually [[New Leudong]]) in the east. Gurjat traders made up a good fraction of those merchants expelled from [[Moscat]] in 1652, several months before the fall of the [[Ibadi Imamate]] to [[Hadramot]] forces.
