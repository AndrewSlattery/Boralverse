**Kernow** (Merch /ˈkɛː.nə/, Borlish **Cornou** /kɔʀˈnu/) refers to the north-western peninsula of [[Gaul]]. Known in antiquity as Armorica, Brittania or Dumnonia, it was resettled in the early medieval period by Kelt peoples from [[Albion]].
## History
The Kernovan kingdoms at the dawn of the eighth century had only recently been unified, ruled by widowed Queen [[Maud of Angeus]]. Her son [[Vigo the Magnificent|Vigo]] ascended to the throne upon her death in 720, shortly after the [[Catumagin Accord]] which ended hostilities and established an official border with the [[Kingdom of the Franks]]. Vigo spearheaded the reconquest of [[Devon]] from the kingdom of [[Wessex]], uniting the two peninsulas as the [[Kingdom of Greater Devon]].

The polity suffered somewhat during the ninth and tenth centuries, with the encroachment of the Franks in the east and with extensive Viking raids along the coasts (the monastery at Landvennick was even burned to the ground in 888 N).

The region derives its modern name from the House of Kernow, which in the eleventh century took power by means of an alliance with [[Normandy]]. This [[Kernovan Conjuring]] led to the establishment of the [[First Drengot Empire]], of which Kernow was a minor vassal.

The [[Brethin]] of Kernow enjoyed significant religious influence during the late medieval period.

Kernow became part of the Kingdom of [[Britain]] in the fifteenth century as it incorporated territories further afield from its heartland in [[Wales]].
