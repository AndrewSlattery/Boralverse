Saxony is a polity in Europe bordering places such as [[Bavarn]], [[Poland]], [[Willemy]] and [[Bohemia]].

# History
During the [[Second Tetrarchy]], the Kingdom of Saxony was a major vassal state of the [[German Empire]] administered from Bardwick, and many of their Houghbrocken dynasty ruled the empire outright. The region in the twelfth century is characterised by tensions between Saxony and [[Bavarn]], the other major vassal kingdom of the empire.

The Kingdom of Saxony was affected by the collapse of the Second Tetrarchy in the thirteenth century; the nascent [[Stadbund]] of mercantile cities in the north seceding and reducing Saxony to its lands upstream in Maidburg and [[Lepzi]].

Saxony is considered to have profited most from the [[First German War]]; in its aftermath the polity controlled more territory than it had at any point in its history.

In the nineteenth century, the [[Blue Marian Society]] (which was founded in Lepzi) spearheaded movements for reform to inheritance and suffrage laws.
