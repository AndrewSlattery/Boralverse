Southbar (Borlish Sothbar /sɔθˈbar/ \[sʊhˈbɐː\]) is a region of [[Borland]] in the southwest of the island. Its largest population centre is the city of [[Axbane]].
## History
The petty kingdom of Southbar was founded by Angle immigrants in the fifth century, along with [[Angland]] and several more minor kingdoms. It quickly established itself in opposition to Angland and to the rump sub-Roman Borlish state. At the turn of the ninth century it saw an influx of immigration from East Anglia after it was subjugated by [[Markland]].

After an alliance between the [[Borland#First Kingdom of Borland|First Kingdom of Borland]] and [[Angland]] and the [[Battle of Fendal (810)]], Southbar was forced to swear fealty as a subordinate kingdom.

Southbar held out for some time against the Danes after the fall of the [[Borland#First Kingdom of Borland|First Kingdom of Borland]], and even harboured the exiled [[Jothey of Borland|King Jothey]] and his wife [[Brenna of Barrow]]. Nonetheless, by the end of the tenth century Southbar had been incorporated into [[Borland#Dane-ruled Borland|Dane Borland]].

In the twelfth century Southbar had become a county. Its de facto seat was Axbane; by 1190 Count Steven is known to have resided year-round in the coastal town, bequeathing the old house in [[Heitriç]] to his younger brother.
