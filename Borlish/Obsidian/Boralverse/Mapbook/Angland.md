Angland (Borlish **Anglont** /anˈglɔnt/ \[ɐŋˈglɔnt\]) is a region in [[Borland]] in the west of the island. Its largest population centre is the city of [[Vithor]].
## History
The petty kingdom of Angland was founded by Angle immigrants in the fifth century, along with [[Southbar]] and several more minor settlements. It quickly established itself in opposition to Southbar and to the rump sub-Roman Borlish state in the east. At the turn of the ninth century it saw an influx of immigration from East Anglia after that kingdom was subjugated by [[Markland]].

After a series of temporary alliances between Angland and Borland, the marriage of Roman king [[Stiglan of Borland|Stiglan]]'s son [[Marc of Borland|Marc]] to the only daughter of [[Alfegh of Angland]] unified the kingdoms for good. This was shortly followed by the [[Battle of Fendal (810)]] which forced Southbar to swear fealty as a subordinate kingdom. Not long thereafter was Angland conquered by the Danes along with the rest of the island.

The Borland varieties of Old English survived longest in Angland, with records suggesting that an English language descending from the original settlers was spoken in rural parts of the region until as late as the seventeenth century.
