Andalus is a polity in the south of the Spanish peninsula. The languages of Morrove Arabic and Mostara Spanish are both widely spoken in the region.

# History
Ninth-century Andalus saw the flowering of theoretic advancements; in particular, glassmaking techniques accelerated rapidly due to a cut-off of supply from the east, leading to the prodigious export of so-called "jackdaw glass".

The [[Brethin]] religious order spread into the Christian-majority areas of Andalus from the north during the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Around this time Andalus lost significant territory in the north and east to Christian polities, such as the newly-established Kingdom of [[Barcelon]].

In the fifteenth century, while its neighbour [[Vascony]] was ascendant, Andalus was beset by struggles. Controlled from across the straits by [[Morrack]], its issues included two successive succession crises as well as the 1457 Lisbon Massacre. 

Vascony was forced to cede [[Portingale]], its economic heart, to Andalus after a series of military successes in the [[Romantic Wars]] of the mid-seventeenth century.

Andalus was embroiled in conflict with Morrack (as its neighbour attempted a reconquest) for a prolonged period in the eighteenth century; some but not all of the involved skirmishes are traditionally grouped with the concurrent [[Democratic Wars]] unfolding globally. A signalling line from Cordova to Málaga set-up at this time would develop into the world's first [[Steeplepost|steeplepost]] connection between two major cities.
