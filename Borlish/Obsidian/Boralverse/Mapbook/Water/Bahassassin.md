The **Bahassassin River** is the longest river on the continent of Mendeva, with a total length of just over two thousand leagues. The river passes through multiple polities, including [[Sangathy]] and [[Hasiny]], and its eastern tributaries descend from the [[Sturgovan Mountains]]. The largest city on the banks of the Bahassassin is [[Nadacow]], the capital city of Hasiny. The name of the river comes from the Carovacian name *báhassássin* "mother of rivers".
