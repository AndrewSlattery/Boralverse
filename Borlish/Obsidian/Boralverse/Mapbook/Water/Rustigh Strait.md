The Rustigh Strait (Borlish: **Naur Rustig** /nor rɪˈstaj/, Frisian **Nao Rustig** /nɑw ˈrʏ.stɪg/, literally "calm strait") is the channel of water separating the southern coast of [[Borland]] from the northern coasts of [[Flanders]] and [[Willemy]].

The strait's position often gave it great strategic importance, in terms of both military and trade. For example, coastal cities on the strait like [[Axbane]] and [[Amstel]] were natural stopping points for ships trading between Dane lands to the east and the Welsh and Vascon trade meshes to the west.

During and following the Albick [[Wars of Fealty]], British communities of immigrants spread along the cities on both sides of the Rustig, such as [[Pentrose]].

An air-steeple connection was set up in the 1830s across the Rustig from Nausçod on Borland to Laicouche in French Guillenne (now Lagcóch), where the strait was less than seven leagues across. In 1854 this was superseded by the creation of an undersea barrick cable.
