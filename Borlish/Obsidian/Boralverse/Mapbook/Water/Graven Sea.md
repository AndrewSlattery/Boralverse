The **Graven Sea** (Merch /ˈgɾɛː.vən ˈseː/), formerly also the **Eastmere**, refers to the arm of the [[Atlantic]] Ocean in northern [[Europe]] east of [[Denmark]] and enclosed by several polities.
## Toponymy
The name derives from Scholastic Latin *Gravinia*, a term for the region around this sea. This is a backformation from *gravinicus, graunicus* "from or pertaining to the Graven Sea". In turn, this appears to have been a late medieval scribal error from former *granvicus*, a borrowing from Old Norse *Gandvik*. This placename, identified with the Graven Sea since the fourteenth century, may have originally referred to any of several bodies of water, including the Arctic Ocean.

The archaic synonym *Eastmere* is a calque from the name in various German languages; for instance, in Frise the sea is called the Astmar "east sea".
