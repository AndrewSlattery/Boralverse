Borland (in Borlish **Istr Boral** /ɪstr̩ boˈral/) is the easternmost of the three major landmasses in the [[Northwestern Isles]], and also the name of the singular polity located thereon. The capital of Borland is [[Damvath]], a port city on the east coast of the island.
## Etymology
The name 'Borland' descends via from Old English **Boralland, Borala land** 'land of the Borlish people', where the first element is taken from Latin **Borālī** 'Borlish people'.

The origin of the Latin demonym is disputed. It is unknown whether the Romans knew the land as **īnsula boreālis** 'island in the north' before they settled Borland, or whether they borrowed the native Kelt name **enis borag** 'island of the dawn' (from its easterly position with respect to [[Albion]] and Ireland).
## History
The Iron Age began on Borland at approximately the same time as on the other Northwestern Isles in the ninth century aN. The identity of the first Borland ironworkers is debated and is made complicated by overlapping waves of migrations, but eventually they became identifiably Kelt.

There are several archaelogical structures on Borland which predate the Kelt migrations but which the Kelts repurposed for ritual use. The most famous of these sites is a so-called "labyrinth" located on [[Çadrosc Heath]] in the northwest of the island. The [[Çadrosc labyrinth]] has sparked much unfounded theorising as to its origin and purpose. There are also many cairns dating to this period, now called sarzin stones (from a late medieval use of sarzin "pagan" deriving from Latin Saracēnus "Muslim").
### Borland Kelts
The Kelt population of Borland (self-described as the **Bora Ale**) is poorly documented. The few attestations of their language suggest only a recent divergence from the Briton tongue; they are thought to have arrived on the island from [[Albion]], not directly from the continent, in the fourth century aN.

This culture was connected to the European trade mesh via the export of tin and iron. Imported pottery of this period from finds across the island has been found from as far afield as [[Egypt]] and the [[Persias]].

The Kelts were organised into many tribes each covering small regions and ruled from hill fort structures. Several important religious sites of this time have been unearthed; most famously the Çadrosc labyrinth, which has sparked much unfounded theorising as to its origin and purpose.

The name Borland (Istr Boral) is thought to descend from the Kelt *enis borag* "island of the dawn (viz. East)" and *bora ale* "the other Easterners", which would imply the name was originally as exonym used by Brythonic speakers on Albion. The adoption of this name for the island by the Romans was undoubtedly influenced by its similarity to unrelated Latin boreālis "northern"; this connection is referenced by contemporary writers.

The Borland tradition of [[Revillon]] can trace its origins to a winter feast celebrated by the Kelts, recorded as the *Flidōlus* (further etymology unknown) by third-century Roman historian [[Ammian]].
### Roman Borland

^becd38

Borland developed diplomatic and trade links with Rome from the time of Julius Caesar and his expeditions to Britannia in 55 aN. The Roman conquest of Borland took place through the second half of the first century (especially during the Flavian period), building on their successes in Britannia.

Confederations of Kelt tribes resisted Roman occupation, especially in the north; several uprisings appear to have been explicitly imitating the successes of Buthick of the Iceni in Britannia.

In the second century, Emperor Hadrian adopted different strategies in [[Britain]] and Borland, characterised in Bervisson's 'An Eternal Rome: Ships of Theseus' as 'The Wall and the Hedgerow'. Possibly due to the lack of an analogous frontier to the Pictish lands, these policies are said to have led to significantly more autonomy in Borland, and in particular greater reliance on locally-born legions. There is evidence in writing of a sense of Borlish identity forming alongside the universal Roman citizenship.

It was also under Hadrian that Borland was made a separate province from Britannia; after the Diocletian reforms this became the Diocese of Boral.
#### Religion in Roman Borland
Just as the Romans did across the rest of the empire, the pre-existing sacred practices and divinities on Borland were interpreted through the lens of and recast in the mould of the Roman pantheon. This could be based on really quite tenuous analogies—for example, goddess of trade and the ocean Nahalennia was absorbed into the cult of Pluto, and she was syncretised with his wife Proserpina. Other deities were more localised, like Reagimos, a river god whose name lives on in the river Reim.

The fourth century saw the arrival of Roman Christianity on Borland, leading to the destruction or repurposing of many pagan site, both those originally from the Borland Kelts and shrines built by the Romans themselves.
### Sub-Roman Borland
There is evidence of considerable Roman emigration from Borland to the continent during the late fourth and early fifth centuries, primarily from the cities of the west and south such as Aquae Balneī and Pons Seianus. The urban east was less immediately affected, and even received some Roman immigration from Britannia.

At this time, German peoples (primarily Angles) came from the mainland and settled in Borland, while they and the Saxons also went further and settled much of further-collapsed Albion. By the end of the sixth century they had formed the Borlish petty kingdoms of [[Southbar]] and [[Angland]], along with several minor outlying settlements.

Meanwhile, the political structure of self-described Roman Borland was changing rapidly. Without the external influence of Rome's authority, the decentralised network of towns in the east was unified under the rule of *Prase* [[Victor Rossetus]] as the 'Diocese of Boral'.
### First Kingdom of Borland

^eae453

By the late sixth century the Diocese of Boral had become a monarchy (described in retrospect as the First Kingdom of Borland), whose ruling dynasty claimed descent from Rossetus. 

This period saw a continuous influx of Christians (both Kelt and Roman people displaced by the German migrations and, later, missionaries) to the island. Rome under [[Pope Mercury II]] took a particular strategic influence in Borland, viewing it as a vital Christian outpost from which they could send missionaries east and west to aid the conversion of Albion and the Danes. For this reason, Borland's early monastic culture had an outward focus, unlike the insular communities of [[Ireland]]. The oldest surviving church in Borland is located at the Golfhaun Sanctuary (**Asȳlum Æstuāriī**) which was consecrated at this time.

However, papal opinion of Borland was prone to change, and many saw it as a convenient place of unofficial exile for (politically or theologically) troublesome figures. Thus, any given Borland monastery might house semi-heretical monks 'entrusted with the conversion of the pagans', or else men with suspicious sympathies to one of the Grecian heresies (see in particular the role of [[Marmeronism]]).
### The Tripartite Wars

^f099bb

The influx of English people into Borland continued throughout this period; for example, the Merch subjugation of East Anglia in the last decades of the eighth century sent many people east to the petty kingdoms of Angland and Southbar.

The question of fealty (that is, whether any kingdom of the island would received official recognition and deference from the others) vexed the island throughout this period, with conflicts leading to temporary alliances between Borland and Southbar or Borland and Angland depending on the political climate.

Finally, in the early ninth century, Roman king [[Stiglan of Borland|Stiglan]] married his son [[Marc of Borland|Marc]] to the only daughter of [[Alfegh of Angland]], unifying their kingdoms and forcing Sothbar to pledge fealty after the circa-810 N [[Battle of Fendal (810)|Battle of Fendal]].
### Dane-ruled Borland
Attacks on Borland towns and monasteries by Dane raiders along the coasts began in the late eighth century, spreading gradually westward as viking raids grew lengthier and more lucrative. Through the ninth century raiding is gradually upgraded to long-term settlement, especially in the northern half of the island. Eventually, Dane pretenders (**coronc**) to the Borland throne arose and threatened to topple the kingdom.

After the fall of the First Kingdom in 898 (and the establishment of Dane Borland ruled from Damvath), the young King [[Jothey of Borland|Jothey]] went into exile with his wife Queen [[Brenna of Barrow]] to Sothbar. There they remained at court for over twenty years, and had several children. Subsequently they were forced to flee again to Kent as Dane Borland conquered the remainder of the island, uniting it for the first time since the Roman Empire.
### Medieval Imperia
In the context of the [[First Drengot Empire]] to the west and the [[German Empire]] to the south, independent Borland had significant strategic value both militarily and economically. This was especially true in the towns and cities along the south coast such as [[Axbane]], which saw a great increase in harbour traffic during the eleventh and twelfth centuries.

This period also saw the arrival of the [[Jacobin Fraternity]] to the island. Forced to flee [[Flanders]] in 1067 after being implicated in a popular uprising against Emperor [[Nathaniel II, Drengot Emperor|Nathaniel II]], they built the Penisular Monastery overlooking the city of Axbane.
### Post-Tetrarchic Borland
With the collapse of the [[German Empire]] and growing sympathies towards the [[Augsburg See]], Rome considered the [[Baptism of the North]] an urgent undertaking. The Rome-allied Duchy of [[Crain]] collaborated with Borlish missionary forces and the [[Convoy Australier]] to bring Christianity to [[Lithow]] and its more distant [[Graven Sea]] neighbours.

The late thirteenth century sees the birth of a Borlish-language body of literature. Although we have earlier examples of treaties and religious texts in the vulgar tongue, works written in Borlish were hitherto sparse and either utilitarian or didactic.

In 1292 the chronicle 'The Life of [[Catrin of Kernow]]' (**Y Við a Catrin de Cornou**) was written, detailing her early life, marriage into Borlish noblility and eventual assassination in 1232. It is notable for being the first long-form work of Borlish literature written about a layperson, rather than a saint or similar legendary figure.
### The 14th and 15th centuries
The [[Noccair Lyceum]] of the 1300s exemplifies how the mediaeval university system was standardising across Europe. There, students were taught the [[Five Romantic Arts]]: Literature, Argument, Reckoning, Geometry and Songcraft. These were in essence the descendants of the seven Classical arts. Around 1400, as this system began to break down, the Lyceum began to teach alchemy (and a little later, post-Classical history).

The end of the fourteenth century marks the zenith of Borlish trade power, with cities along the [[Rustigh Strait]] (especially Axbane) trafficked both by the Dutch stadbund's fleet and Borland's own. In this way Borland served as a crossroads between the Vascon trade mesh in the west and the stadbund's to the east. Later, in the 1400s, Borland lost ground to the ascendant [[Wales]] and [[Vascony]], which began to monopolise trade coming from the [[Middlesea]] and [[Africa]]. 

In the first decade of the fifteenth century, Queen [[Natalia I of Borland|Natalia I]] and her husband King [[Joseph I of Borland|Joseph I]] ruled jointly. Their family had been and would continue to be beset by misfortune; all three of their sons predeceased them, as did their few male grandchildren (either in infancy or by misadventure). 

The succession crisis prompted by their deaths in 1411 and 1416 spelt the end of their dynasty. From the ashes rose the [[Saulestran dynasty|Saulestran]] lineage of kings, whose banner comprised a white bar cutting a twilight-blue field.

Borland was not directly involved in the Albion-wide [[Wars of Fealty]], but it received an influx of immigration from the polities involved, as people were displaced in the many border conflicts and attempted conquests. In particular, this period saw substantial Welsh, Devoner and Kernish immigration to the cities of southern Borland.
### Borland after the Novamundine Landfall
With the dawn of the sixteenth century and the waning power of Vascony, the dominance of Borlish cities over regional trade reached its peak. Damvath was said to be the most-trafficked port in [[Europe]] outside the Middlesea at this time.

The [[Second Great Dying]] reached Borland in March of 1519; likely due to the volume of trade there, the island's first recorded death attributable to the plague was in Damvath during the year's green snowfall. Borland lost over four hundred thousand people—one-seventh of its population—to the plague.

After the death of [[Joseph III of Borland|Joseph III]] in 1534 N, his nephew [[Brandon II of Borland|Brandon II]] succeeded to the throne (King Joseph never succeeded in producing a natural-born heir, despite several recognised yet illegitimate children by his various mistresses). Having known he would inherit, King Brandon had made sure to be well-liked at court; upon his accession he managed to impose a terrene tax on the land despite significant opposition from his most powerful vassals.

Borland became entangled in the [[War for the Stavang Crown]] in the 1550s, a protracted succession crisis for the [[Dane Concert]] following the death of the king while undertaking a grand tour of his lands.

The practice of serfdom (already on its last legs) was legally abolished in Borland in 1564, but by that point it had not *de facto* existed on the island for a generation. This is often cited as being due to the labour shortage resulting from the disruption of the Second Great Dying.
### The 17th and 18th centuries
Borland's involvement in the [[Romantic Wars]] was restricted to a failed invasion (culminating in the [[Hawkirch Surrender]] of 1632), along with unstable arrangements with neighbouring polities regarding military aid in their conquests.

Through this period, Borlish trade guilds were involved in the establishment of staddomains along Atlantic [[Cappatia]] and [[Africa]]. Initially little more than trading posts, these would grow into significant polities over the next centuries.

Agricultural innovations in Borland began to accelerate in the eighteenth century. The Pentrose survey of the 1730s was a coordinated effort to find the most productive or otherwise useful cultivars of many plants which spurred significant productivity increases. Its crowning glory was the braxoch beet, a hybrid of Silesian and Cassuvian beets whose sugar content was high enough to make domestic sugar production economical.
### Borland in the [[Long Peace]] and afterward
The location of the Borlish parliament had until this point not been fixed to one building—usually one member would donate use of an estate for the duration of a legislative session. In the late eighteenth century this state of affairs ended, with the completion of the [[Jacobean Estates]] (**Palaç Jagovin**) in Damvath.

During the inflamed period of [[Reaction War]] which followed the Long Peace, Borland participated in the [[Second German War]]. Borlish soldiers were present at the disastrously mismanaged [[Battle of Hulm (1821)|Battle of Hulm]] in 1821, and they fought alongside troops from many nearby countries, such as [[Furlain]] and [[Crovatia]]. The war and Borland's alliance with the [[Northern Concert]] sparked major mozard protests in cities across the country.
### Borland in the Workshop decades
The [[Steeplepost|steeplepost]] arrived late to Borland, with most of the island's flag-lamp lines being erected in the 1810s and 1820s (somewhat accelerated by strategic military considerations). Axbane was later connected to the continent at Texel in Willemy via air-steeples, but by 1860 this had been replaced (along with much of the island's steeplemesh) by a barrick line.

The spelling reform of 1870 (the last major revision to Borlish spelling conventions) primarily acted to standardise—at the time, many words had multiple forms in use reflecting more or fewer of the sound changes of the last few centuries.
### The [[Good Game]] period
The genre of [[Masquira romance|masquira]] which originated in Spain flourished in Borland in the late nineteenth century. The particular popularity of kevler romance (**romanç kevlar**) on the island produced several sensation trevolds and lead to the term being borrowed into several other languages.

The 1890s saw Borland join the growing [[Drengot Collusion]] (several Borlish cities, although not the capital, had already joined as part of the [[New Urban Mesh]]); Queen Natalia II abdicated on 1894's [[Revillon]] due to the political upheaval of this process.

In 1981 Borland had an anthracite administration.
## Culture
The celebration of [[Revillon]] is an ancient tradition in Borland; some form of the practice dating back to the time of the Insular Kelts. As part of the festivities, people bring pastries and other baked goods to grand Revillon Feasts (**Fest Reveglon**) held in churches across the country.

In Borland, if in a given year there is snow in spring after the [[David's Day|yearturning]] (i.e. on or after the 1st of March), the first such snow is called the 'green snowfall' (**neyanç vert**). Years which have a green snowfall are generally considered unlucky, as a symptom of a long and bitter preceding winter.

There are several Borlish folk songs of unknown origin, including the '[[Season Song]]' (**Cant a Saçon**). This song, like many in its tradition, uses an idiosyncratic scale sometimes mistakenly conflated with the [[Manoscard|manoscard]] scale.

The figures of the [[Graveyard Fiddlers|graveyard fiddlers]] are a folk tradition peculiar to Borland. These spirits associated with death are said to be the source of a mysterious sound of string instruments heard especially in cemeteries.

A related group are the Wild Hunt (**Cauç Ragnt**), a party of hunters passing overhead said to be responsible for the sound of thunder and strong winds. A children's story common to many cultures across Europe, the Wild Hunt in Borland shows clear signs of a Dane origin—not least that it is traditionally led by **Balegr**, a kenning of Odin.

## Language
By far the most commonly-spoken language in Borland is the [[Borlish language]], the only surviving branch of Insular Romance. It share many features with Gallo-Romance, including loss of case and intervocalic lenition. It was also heavily influenced in the first millennium by Old English and Old Norse.
