Lepzi is the capital city of [[Saxony]], located on the Bleak Alstre.
## History

Lepzi first acted as political centre for the First Kingdom of [[Saxony]], very briefly just prior to its collapse at the close of the thirteenth century. The Houghbrocken dynasty ruled from there for some years before being removed to [[Magdeburg]] when the house was reduced to the four-year-old Marksman Baldur.

With the conclusion of the [[First German War]] in 1770, Saxony was ascendant and controlled more territory than it had at any point in its history. Lepzi was subject to attendant early urbanisation and trebled in population in just fifty years. It was one of the vanguards of the [[Global Workshop]] period, exploiting vast amounts of locally-mined coal power.

The Blue Marian Society, which agitated for inheritance and suffrage law reforms, was founded in the nineteenth century in Lepzi.
