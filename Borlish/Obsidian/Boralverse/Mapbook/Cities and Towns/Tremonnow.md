Tremonnow (Merch /tɾəˈmɔ.nə/, Welsh Trevonwy /ˌtɾe.vəˈnui/) is a town in the southeast of [[Wales]], the administrative centre of the district of [[Glousing]].
## Toponymy
The name Tremonnow derives from the Welsh *trew* "town" and the name of the river it lies on, the Monnow (compare Welsh *Mynwy* "the Monnow", which is of unclear origin).
## History
The lands around Tremonnow were conquered from the medieval Welsh kingdom of Guent by [[Vigo the Magnificent]] during the formation of the kingdom of [[Devon]] in the first half of the eighth century.

The Christian order called the [[Brethin]] was founded in Tremonnow at some point before 800 N under the patronage of Vigo's daughter [[Iseld of Devon|Iseld]]. The order would become renowned for their efforts at historical documentation, and their archives in what eventually became the modern [[Tremonnow Gravatory]] preserve invaluable sources on early medieval [[Albion]] (including a copy of the Chronicle of Carlile).

From the mid-twentieth century, the [[Tremonnow Open School]], formerly known as the Brethin Mesh Institute, provided distance learning in Welsh and Wessern across Albion and, latterly, also across [[British Mendeva]].

## People
