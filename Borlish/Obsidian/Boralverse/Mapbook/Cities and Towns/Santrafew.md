Santrafew (Merch /sənˈtɹa.fəw/; Provincial **Sant Rafeu** /sanˈtra.vaw/) is the capital of [[New Provence]]. Located on the [[Mendeva|Mendevan]] coast on the banks of the Becouin River, it is one of the oldest European settlements on the continent's mainland.

# History
Santrafew was founded in 1564 as a trading post for [[Provence|Provincial]] merchant guilds. It was named for the archangel Raphael in his guise as a patron of travellers. In its first century, pocket communities of people appeared in Santrafew, as the fleets of Provence employed mariners from across the [[Middlesea]].

Early imports into Santrafew included horse stocks and metal tools, traded in exchange for furs and new foodstuffs.

In 1590 Derek Nassow, the heir apparent to the Duchy d'[[Avosche]] in [[Willemy]], fled overseas to Santrafew for unclear reasons. This led to an incendiary scandal that rocked courts across Western Europe and especially that of King [[David of France]].

The 1621 Becouin Treaty outlined the legal relationship of Santrafew to the Mendevan peoples of the region for some generations. Following the British Sack of Santrafew, in which the Mastoisèt in particular were alleged to have collaborated, the treaty was broken by Mayor Alexandre fi Marco's embargo and ten-league exile of the Mastoisèt in particular (and other Mendevan groups in practice).

Immigration into Santrafew spiked dramatically in the 1820s, in the aftermath of the [[Second German War]]. The newcomers arrived in greatest numbers from [[Barcelon]] and [[Lombardy]], spurred on by a combination of wartime displacement and presumably some familiarity with Provincial language.

Santrafew had means sufficiently-fast commnication across the Atlantic Ocean by the 1930s that papers such as [[Fiellas Dimenja]] could be published simultaneously there and in [[Vascony]].
