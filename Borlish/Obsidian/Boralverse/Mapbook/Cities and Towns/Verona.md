Verona is a city in the north-east of the Italian peninsula.

# History
During the tenth century and into the time of the [[Second Tetrarchy]], Verona and its province were contested between the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] (and latterly, [[Lombardy]]) and the [[German Empire]]. The Verona branch of the Adelchian dynasty ruled Lombardy during the eleventh century.

In the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, Verona was part of (and the most prosperous city in) the duchy of [[Furlain]].

Verona was badly affected by the [[Second German War]] of the early nineteenth century. The arena in Verona, a classical amphitheatre, was reopened for performances shortly after the end of the war.
