The **New Urban Mesh** was an alliance of somewhat autonomous cities in Northwest [[Europe]] in the nineteenth century. Among its members were [[London]], [[Conster]], [[Axbane]], [[Pentrose]], [[Amstel]], [[Anvers]] and [[Gant]].
## History

The Mesh emerged contemporaneously with similar political structures elsewhere, such as the [[Riverine Cities]] along the [[Danaw]]. Several of the Mesh's cities were simultaneously also part of pre-existing polities (for example, Axbane and Pentrose were never legally independent from [[Borland]]).

This rise of such federacies of city-states has been attributed to the rapid population growth and expansion of cities in the run-up to the [[Global Workshop]] period. The Mesh in particular was at the forefront of shipbuilding technology, and had access to an appreciable fraction of the world's coal production.

The cities of the Mesh are popularly associated with wheeling-and-dealing policy, as well as aggressive and global use of espionage. However, the extent to which the Mesh was (for example) able to steer politics in the East to their trade benefit is likely overestimated.

In the late nineteenth century (ca. 1890), London led the Mesh to unite politically with the [[Drengot Collusion]], at the time a nascent alliance of the French polities of Norman [[Kent]], [[Paris]] and [[Burgundy]]. Whether it is more correct to say that the Mesh was subsumed into the Collusion, or that the Mesh took control of the Collusion, has long been a topic of heated debate.
