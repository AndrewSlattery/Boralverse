**Denmark** is a peninsular polity located between the North and Graven Seas.
## History
Denmark was part of the homeland of the Danes during the [[Dane Supremacy]] in the medieval period, from which viking raids and colonisation projects left. The rulers of [[Borland]] and much of [[Dane England]] during this time were dynasties originating in Denmark.

During the sixteenth century, Denmark was part of the [[Dane Concert]], a monarchic union of northern states. The royal family undertook a grand tour of their realm in the years around 1560, visiting places like [[Alburgh]]. It was this period which saw Revitalism reach Denmark, with renewed interrogation of Classical texts.

Instability in Denmark belying the [[Long Peace]] of the late eighteenth century led to an uptick in emigration, both to nearby polities like Borland and also the distant staddomains of [[Cappatia]]. 

The expansion of suffrage in Denmark took place through the latter half of the nineteenth century, parallel to similar movements in [[Saxony]] and the [[Latin republics]]. During this time Denmark was drawn into the orbit of the [[Drengot Collusion]], although it was never fully incorporated.
