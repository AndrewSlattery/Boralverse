The Novomund, also called the New World, refers to the lands to the west of the Atlantic Ocean. Inhabited for over a myriad years, the history of these lands dovetails with that of the [[Vetomund]] following the [[Novomundine Landfall]] of 1471.

The Novomund comprises the two great landmasses of [[Mendeva]] and [[Cappatia]], along with several dozen major islands (such as [[Brasil]] and [[Cocain]]) and innumerable lesser ones.

Many crops now cultivated worldwide were first farmed in the Novomund, including shadome fruit, tartover, shockle and mikecorn. Products such as coshow and kistmaw also derive from plants native to the Novomund.
