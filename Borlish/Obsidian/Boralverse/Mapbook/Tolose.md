Tolose is a city and region in the south of ][[Gaul]], formerly an independent polity. It was a march (and then a duchy) vassal of the [[First Drengot Empire]] in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, bordering the kingdom of [[Barcelon]] to the south. However, the region maintined significant independence, with its own standing army. Following the collapse of the First Drengot Empire, Tolose became a hotly contested border region. It was conquered by [[Vascony]] from the west in the fifteenth century (see Prince [[Mark of Tolose]], heir to the Vascon throne who predeceased his father in 1453). In the first decade of the sixteenth century, Barcelon conquered Tolose from Vascony, and the region has been territory belonging to the kingdom of Barcelon since (barring some brief exceptions).
