Bavarn (Bóarn /ˈpoː.ɑːn/) is a centrally-located German polity of [[Europe]]. Among others, it borders [[Bohemia]], [[Burgundy]], [[Furlain]], [[Saxony]], and [[Willemy]].

## History
During the [[Second Tetrarchy]], the Kingdom of Bavarn was one of the two main players in the [[German Empire]]; the Empire was for some time ruled jointly by the Houghbrocken and Andex dynasties of Saxony and Bavarn respectively.

Thirteenth-century Bavarn was the epicentre of the [[Pauline Denunciations]] and the [[German Secession]], leading to the establishment of the [[Augsburg See]]. The concomitant strife saw each vassal in Bavarn declare either for [[Rome]] or for [[Augsburg]], in a powderkeg patchwork of allegiances that would collapse the Empire entirely. Bavarn itself would never regain as much Adriatic coast as it had enjoyed just prior to these events.

In the fifteenth century, Bavarn was embroiled in an extended series of conflicts with Burgundy. By this time it had also become a technological centre, with workshops developing entirely new glassmaking techniques. 

Following the [[Blue Trans-Willem War]] of the late nineteenth century, Bavarn gained significant territory from the Kingdom of Burgundy, which subsequently dissolved. As result, then-king Frederick created the Duchy of [[Far Suebia]], ruled from Burgundy's former capital [[Geneva]].

In the eighteenth century, famine and a shortage of grain led to popular unrest that threatened to destabilise the state; the examples of [[Venise]] and [[Crovatia]] to the south demonstrated how badly things could go for the current regime.

The [[Second German War]] embroiled Bavarn, allied with (among others) [[Borland]] and the [[Northern Concert]]; a particularly significant event during this war was the disastrously mismanaged [[Battle of Hulm (1821)|Battle of Hulm]] in 1821.
