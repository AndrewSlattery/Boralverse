Madray is a polity in the southeast of [[India]] governed from the city of the same name.

The British ship Phœbos in the early sixteenth century stopped at the port of Romeswarm in Madray on its geoscopic voyage around [[Africa]] and on to [[Borune]] (where it would meet the [[Morrack]] ship Cynthia travelling in the other direction).

The death of King Rahulamathavan in 1735 is thought to have been due to an early outbreak of [[Pennackit dysentery|pennackit dysentery]] (although global outbreaks of the disease would not begin in earnest until 1753).

As part of the general [[Democratic Wars]] period in the mid-eighteenth century, many states quarrelled for control over parts of India, including Madray. Both relatively nearby powers like [[Cathay]] and distant trade interests like [[Britain]] became embroiled.

The eighteenth century also saw many technological developments out of this region. For example, the use of pedal holes in musical instruments was pioneered by the peria nadaswarm (the apex of arms races to widen pitch ranges and increase volume) which would influence instruments like the torriot into their modern forms.

The voidtale craze begun by [[Elsebeth Sneider]] in 1795 reached as far as Madray; the renowned landscapist Narayanan is especially remembered for his series of works depicting the planets from their surfaces.
