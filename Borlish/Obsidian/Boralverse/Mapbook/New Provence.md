New Provence is a coastal polity in the east of [[Mendeva]]. It is named for [[Provence]], a small [[Middlesea]] state whose trading ships first set up trading posts along the coast of Mendeva in the early sixteenth century.

The country borders [[Ambrosia]] to the north, the states of [[Gulf Mendeva]] to the south, and it shares a short border with [[Hasiny]] to the southwest. It extends inland in places as far as the [[Sturgovan Mountains]].

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the trading posts along the New Provincial coast dealt primarily with Mastoiset peoples, exchanging (for example) metal tools for beaver pelts.

Although by the 20th century the polity was politically independent from Provence, cultural ties remained strong, including shared newspapers and substantial movement of people in both directions. They also shared (until at least 1943) more restrictive morality laws than their neighbours, being the strongest remnants of the [[Modest Arrangement]] of the century prior and notable non-signatories of the 1850 [[Laic Declarations]] of [[Belgrade]].
