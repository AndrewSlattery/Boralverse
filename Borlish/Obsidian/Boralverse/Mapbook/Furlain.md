Furlain (Merch pronunciation /fʊːˈləin/, endonym **Furlagne** /furˈlaɲə/) is a polity in the northeast of the Italian peninsula, whose principal cities are [[Verona]] and [[Udine]]. It borders [[Lombardy]] to the west, [[Bavarn]] to the north, [[Crain]] to the east, and [[Venise]] to the south.

## History
During the [[Second Tetrarchy]] of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the March of Furlain was the southernmost part of the [[German Empire]], at first a direct imperial vassal and later specifically consolidated under the suzerainty of the Kingdom of Bavarn. After the collapse of the German Empire in the thirteenth century, Furlain's most frequent rival became the Republic of [[Venise]]. 

Furlain suffered a severe earthquake in 1348 which destroyed both the castle and cathedral in Udine. Reference to this event is the first attestation of the word *quagment* "earthquake" in the [[Borlish]] language.

The [[Armourcloth|armourcloth]] trend in women's fashion (which emulated men's military dress) began in Furlain during the [[Long Peace]] in the late eighteenth century. The local term *voinacciale* (from *voina*, a slang term for a soldier) was borrowed into several other languages to describe the style.

Troops from Furlain fought in the [[Second German War]] (1815–23), principally against Bavarn. Furlain was allied with such countries as [[Borland]], with whom they undertook the disastrous [[Battle of Hulm (1821)|Battle of Hulm]] in 1821.
