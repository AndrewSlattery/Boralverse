Saint Marinus (Italian: *San Marino*) is a historical city in the Italian state of [[Lombardy]]. It is recognised for the renowned Autonome University, which having been founded in the eleventh century is one of the oldest still-running educational establishments in the world, and especially for its Sovereign Library on the slopes of Titan.

Scholars of the Autonome University were among the first to translate many mathematical texts from Arabic into Latin; for instance, they compiled a *liber numerorum* in 1216 N which (surviving in a copy at the [[Library of Sobjan]]) contains the earliest-known enumeration of arrumb values in [[Europe]].
