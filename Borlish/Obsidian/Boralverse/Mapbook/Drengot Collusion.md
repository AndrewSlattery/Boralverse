The Drengot Collusion was a multinational alliance-federacy in northwestern [[Europe]]. Named for the older Drengot Empires (themselves named for the Norman noble family who first united much of [[Gaul]] and [[Albion]]), it grew from various treaties in the mid-nineteenth century into the principal power in the region until its dramatic collapse in 1961.

# History
The Drengot Collusion arose among the French polities of the [[Global Workshop]] period. Shortly thereafter the [[New Urban Mesh]] (a collection of somewhat-autonomous cities including independent [[London]], as well as [[Axbane]] on [[Borland]]) was subsumed—or took control of, depending on one's personal biases—the nascent Collusion.

The entirety of Borland entered the Collusion in 1894 as part of a series of events there that also led to the abdication of the Queen [[Natalia II of Borland|Natalia II]] and the concomitant dissolution of the Borlish monarchy.

Alongside the cities of London and [[Paris]], [[Kent]] was the political centre of the Drengot Collusion, with many governmental buildings located in [[Roun]].

Tensions between the Collusion and their southern neighbours (to wit, [[Vascony]] and [[Provence]]) grew particularly tense in the two decades following the [[Millstone War]]. For this reason it is notable that the [[Fiellas Dimenja]] newspaper (headquartered in [[Marsella]]) enjoyed considerable readership across the Collusion even in the 1930s.

Although [[Portingale]] was never part of the Collusion, it occupied a peripheral position in its orbit. This led to diplomatic tensions with Vascony, located directly between the Collusion and Portingale. For a time, Drengot [[Astraphor|astraphor]] supplied (via undersea powerline) much of the baric needs of Portingale, thus relying on Vascon goodwill not to interfere. This situation changed in the 1950s, with Portingale funding threshold mills to supply its own [[Astraphor|astraphor]].

# The Furore of 1961
At the time of the Furore, the Collusion was being administered by a tinplate government under [[Romney Darchild]].

One of the scandals of the Furore was the revelation of the clandestine activities undertaken by the [[Red House]] (the popular name of the Collusion's Ministry for Information) in Roun. These activities, enumerated in the Darchild memorandum, acted as a powderkeg, first bringing down the current administration and shortly thereafter the entire Collusion.

# Aftermath
One effect of the collapse of the Drengot Collusion was the implementation of the [[Kentish ostracon reforms]], which would go on to be used as a model in several polities across the globe.
