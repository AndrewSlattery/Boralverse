**Sodrick** (Merch /ˈsɔ.drɪk/, Welsh Heleð /heˈlɛð/) is a region of the [[Northwestern Isles]] comprising many small islands north of [[Wales]] and west of [[Scotland]].

## Toponymy
The name *Sodrick* was originally a demonym for the people of *Soder* (Old English *Sodor*), which descends from the Old Norse suðreyjar "southern islands".

## History
Sodrick was settled during the Norse ascendancy of the eighth and ninth centuries, at the same time as Danes arrived on the shores of [[Albion]] and [[Ireland]]. Harald the Blue of Sodrick contributed to the establishment of the Kingdom of [[Scotland]] in the ninth century. Even the Welsh island of [[Mondwell]] was half-controlled by Sodrick for some time after a partition agreed between Sodrick and [[Guineth]] that was recorded in both the Ulster and Carlile chronicles.

During the tenth century, the kingdom of [[Dunclothe]] under [[Roderick of Dunclothe|Roderick]] invaded and conquered many of the isles of Sodrick from the Danes, including Arran in 934 and (most significantly, as a power centre) the isle of Man in 942. The decline of Dane power in Sodrick has been connected to the decreased efficiency of obtaining wealth by raiding over time.

As Dunclothe took control of Sodrick, many fled or were expelled to places like Dane-ruled [[York]] and [[Ireland]], or to relatively prosperous [[Normandy]]. Among their number is recorded the first unambiguous mention of identical triplets (Danes born on the isle of Mull around 915) in European history.

By the fifteenth century, Sodrick was subordinate to [[Wales]], and it was incorporated as an outlying tallath of the Kingdom of [[Britain]] when it was formed.
