London (Borlish **Londr** /ˈlɔn.dr̩/) is a city and polity on the island of [[Albion]]. The city is downstream on the River Tames, and the polity comprises much of the Tames' watershed. It is bordered to the north by [[Markland]], the south by [[Kent]], and the west by [[Britain]].
## History
London was established by the Romans shortly after their invasion around 50 N, named from a Kelt placename referring to the local floodplain.

After time as a secondary city in Albion, London became the imperial capital of the region once more during the [[Second Tetrarchy]] as part of the [[First Drengot Empire]]. 

The [[First Burning of London]] took place in 1290; at least 400 people were killed in the ensuing week-long disaster. This was one of several conflagrations in the first half of the second millennium, many due to the city being perennially conquered from the north or south. 

The [[Democratic Wars]] of the mid-eighteenth century saw London finally gain lasting independence from its neighbours in 1748 under Queen Margaret, who could trace her ancestry to the royal families of both Markland and Kent. The office of Lord Mayor remained politically powerful enough to rival that of the new monarch, however.

London is home to the [[New Lyceum]], a preeminent research university established in the late eighteenth century.

Seventy-fifth anniversary celebrations in 1823 saw significant infrastructural investments in the region, with a great deal of building along the south bank of the Tames.

London's population grew rapidly during the [[Global Workshop]] period of the mid-nineteenth century. It became a lead member of the [[New Urban Mesh]] of several major cities in the region, and spearheaded the Mesh's takeover of (or submission into) the larger [[Drengot Collusion]].

The independent polity of London has been long associated with spycraft, with events like the 1887 Desarden Affair (involving the London ambassador to [[Nackon Day]]) and the many Londoners in the [[Roun]] [[Red House]] (the intelligence centre for the Drengot Collusion) implicated in the [[Furore of 1961]] cementing this image in the popular imagination.
