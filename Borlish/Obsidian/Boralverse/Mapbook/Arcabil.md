The **Arcabil** are a collection of islands in the Atlantic, east of [[Mashick]]. They comprise hundreds of landmasses, of which [[Cocain]] is the largest.
## Toponymy
The name "Arcabil" has traditionally been considered to be an uncomplicated use of Arabic أَرْخَبِيل • ('archabīl) "archipelago", borrowed into Scholastic Latin as Arcabilia (and treated as a plural on the basis of its -bilia ending). However, there is little evidence of such a word existing in Arabic in the fifteenth century.

The possibility has been raised of a metathetic and dissimilatory variant of unattested الكريب • (al-carīb) "the Carib", using a local name for a group of peoples of the Arcabil, but the phonetics are tenuous.
## History
The Arcabil were first encountered by Vetomundine powers in the late fifteenth century, during the first stage of the New World Company's voyages west under the aegis of Malik [[Munir al-Hamdawi of Morrack|Munir al-Hamdawi]]. By the early sixteenth century [[Morrack]] had established several semi-permanent outposts there, which were important ports for the circumnavigation of the Cynthia under Fredun al-Casmi.

The orange liqueur known as "fleuse" is a genericisation of the Fleus d'Arcabil mixer first manufactured in the early nineteenth century on a Borlish-speaking island of the Arcabil.
