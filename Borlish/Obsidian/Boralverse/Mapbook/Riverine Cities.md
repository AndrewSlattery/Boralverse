The Riverine Cities were an alliance-federacy of small independent states along the Danaw River and its tributaries linked by treaty and trade in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Each state consisted primarily of a single urban area and the surrounding rural hinterland, though the enforcement of territorial borders was often rather nominal.

The political structure of the Riverine Cities grew out of the ashes of the [[Kingdom of Danaw]], which had collapsed in spectacular fashion after the [[Second German War]] of the 1820s.

The Cities were a hotbed for underground or subversive organisations, including the [[Deviance movement]], and were host to several semi-public tovarick communities. This environment was likely fostered by the presence of significant religious minorities and the strong ties between the Church and the local urban authorities.

Members of the Riverine Cities included Belgrade, Boxa, Gollamo and Pojon.
