British Mendeva refers to the polities of [[Mendeva]] which have undergone significant settlement from or otherwise been significantly influenced by the Kingdom of [[Britain]]. The region is mostly contained within the larger region of [[Gulf Mendeva]]. The polity of the region with the most population and global influence is [[Hasiny]].

## History

In the seventeenth century, exploratory voyages by ships of the Kingdom of Britain founded staddomains along the Mendevan Gulf, which would grow via settlement, treaty and conquest into the polities of British Mendeva.  

The '[[herdtale]]' tradition of storytelling which originated in nineteenth-century Mendeva was brought to wider recognition via several popular works published jointly in British Mendeva and Britain. Conversely, the [[Masquira romance|masquira]] genre overtook the region later in that century following its popularity in the [[Vetomund]].

British Mendeva overtook Britain in population and industry in the latter years of the nineteenth century. Nonetheless, for some time Britain retained a position of cultural cachet; it has been suggested this contributed to British Mendeva's rapid adoption of the ethics of the [[Household Renovation]] (as compared to much more ambivalent [[New Provence]] and [[Mashick]], for instance) during this time.

Unlike earlier centuries, the nineteenth century saw significant transmigration of the élites between British Mendeva and Britain, as well as much more intermarriage. In part this can be attributed to the newness of an autochthonous élite west of the Atlantic, but mostly this is simply due to faster ships and greatly-reduced travel times.
