Vascony (Vascon: **Vasconna**), or more fully the Vascon Kingdom of Navarre and Aquitain (Vascon: **Lo Reiame Vascòn a Navarr'i Aquitanna**, Vask: **Navarron t'Aquitainon Vasca Herria**) is a polity of western [[Europe]] occupying parts of southern [[Gaul]] and northern [[Spain]]. 

# History

Vascony was formed from the political union of Aquitain and Navarre, later expanding to vassalise Leon in the twelfth century.

The fifteenth century saw the [[Vascon Ascendancy]], which began by most accounts in the reign of [[Ambrose II of Vascony|Ambrose II]] and reached a peak with his grandson [[Ambrose III of Vascony|Ambrose III]]. At the start of this period Vascony was at its territorial maximum: it had conquered northern [[Portingale]] and subjugated the rest as a nominally-independent client, as well as much of southern [[Burgundy]] (which is to say, enough of [[Provence]] to share a border with the Italian states of [[Jeans]] and [[Lombardy]]).

In 1458 Ambrose III established by royal decree the [[New Navarre Enterprise]], whose primary aim was to solidify Vascon supremacy in the trade of North Atlantic fish through the [[Middlesea]]. British dominion over the Atlantic had long frustrated Vask fishing families, members of which still predominated in the aristocracy. It was ships of this guild that in 1471 sighted [[Brasil]] and brought news of the [[Novomund]] to Europe. 

The decades following the Novomundine Landfall brought new prosperity to Vascony, and in particular to Portingale. At the same time, the polity suffered militarily: the Kingdom of Burgundy retook Provence in 1494 (sparking the 1497–99 [[War of Provincial Independence]]), and a decade later the remainder of Vascony's Middlesea coast (primarily the region of [[Tolose]]) was taken by [[Barcelon]].

Being a maritime power, Vascony had explored parts of the African coast (as far south as Sant Adrian \[Bioko\]) during the fifteenth century. However, for much the same reason Vascony lost over a fifth of its population to the [[Second Great Dying]] in the years after the plague's arrival in Europe in 1519. Despite this, thanks to Novomundine profits in furs and other goods, the polity actually saw in increase in population from 1500 to 1550 (excluding Portingale) due to immigration.

The [[Vascon Ascendancy]] is generally considered to have ended with the [[War of the Two Queens]] near the end of the sixteenth century, which also saw the formal end of feudalism within the polity.

The parts of [[Mendeva]] first explored by (and whose trade was monopolised by) Vascony—to wit, the island of Brasil and the lands westward thereof—was named [[Ambrosia]] in honour of Ambrose III.

During the [[Romantic Wars]] of the mid-seventeenth century, Vascony fought primarily with [[Morrack]] to the south. The polity was forced to cede Portingale, its economic heart, to [[Andalus]] (then controlled by Morrack) after a series of military defeats.

In an example of early international cooperation, a canal system connecting Bordew to Audaz in Barcelon was completed in 1679.

Vascony was at the vanguard of the [[Modest Arrangement]], a social movement in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries characterised by more stringent enforcement of morality codes, especially with respect to familial powers. Famously, author Antòin Herrel (latterly Tony Smith) was forced to flee Vascony to [[Kent]] after attempting to publish his blasphemous work 'Earthly Scene' (**Vista Terrena**).

At first, Vascony managed not to become embroiled in the [[Second German War]] of the 1820s. Once its interests in Mendeva and the East were threatened, however, then-king Hernand IV had no choice but to declare against the Northern Concert and in favour of the Convoy.

Into the twentieth century, Vascony maintained strong ties with its neighbour Provence by virtue of a shared enmity towards the [[Drengot Collusion]] to their north.
