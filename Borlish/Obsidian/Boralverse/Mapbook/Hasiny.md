Hasiny is the largest and most populous of the polities of [[British Mendeva]]. This refers to the region of [[Mendeva]] which have undergone significant settlement from or otherwise been significantly influenced by the Kingdom of [[Britain]].

Hasiny is centred on the lower parts of the watershed of the Bahassassin River, but its lands extend sufficiently far northeast so as to share a short border with [[New Provence]] along part of the [[Sturgovan Mountains|Sturgovan]] range. It borders the polity of [[Taisha]] to the west, and its capital city is [[Nadacow]], which lies on the Bahassassin.

The name Hasiny derives from the confederation of the same name, which once extended across lands which are now part of Hasiny and Taisha.

The languages of administration in Hasiny are Jaughta (**Jahtá**, the Mendevan language spoken by a majority of the populace) and the local variety of Welsh (which differs in important ways from the dialects of [[Britain|British]] or [[Chrysia|Chrysian]] Welsh).

Hasiny was the homeland of the [[Herdtale romance|herdtale]] genre of fiction, which sought to depict a rural idyll with a focus on animal husbandry.

The resort town of Y Davarn Heul (The Sun Hotel) was constructed in the nineteenth century for Hasiny's ruling Tamaha dynasty, gaining such fame that the word "davarn" has entered many languages with the meaning "grand hotel, resort".

The first radio was built in Hasiny in 1903. The fourth Lineball Global Tourney (LGT) in 1935 took place in Hasiny, the first time it was held in Mendeva.
