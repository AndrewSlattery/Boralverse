Lower Mendeva (Borlish Mendeva Bassem /ˌmɛn.deˈva ˈba.sɛm/) is a geographical region comprising the southern section of the continent of [[Mendeva]], located west of the [[Mendevan Gulf]]. The term sometimes also includes the islands of the [[Arcabil]], which are located within said Gulf.

The region is predominated by the polity of [[Mashick]], which stretches from coast to coast and so far north as to border [[Mivock]] in the west and [[Taisha]] in the east.

Many barrick innovations of the late [[Global Workshop|Workshop]] period came out of Lower Mendeva, likely due to practical concerns around the rapid spread of wired post (there being little previous adoption of the flag-lamp [[Steeplepost|steeplemesh]] in the region to displace). 

By the late twentieth century, this region had become major exporters of foods such as mause and amback. 

Many trade goods originated in Lower Mendeva, including billrod dye, shockle, shadome and tashban.
