Tavancy (Merch /təˈvan.səi/, Run'allo *Tawanden* /taˈwan.dɛn/), formerly the Tavancine Empire, is a politiy in western [[Cappatia]] occupying the coast between the Isthmus to the north and [[Maboutia|Maboutian]] lands to the south.
## Toponymy
The name Tavancy (Latin *Tavantia*) is a back-formation from the adjective Tavancine (Latin *tavantīnus*). This comes from the earliest Latin name *imperium tavantīnum* first attested in the sixteenth century, which was borrowed via Morrove Arabic as a somewhat-mistaken partial calque from the Run'allo *tawantin-suyu* "the quartet of provinces".

## History
The first Vetomundine people to document the Tavancine Empire were Morrack traders with the New World Company (شركة العالم الجديد), who had already begun dealing with [[Arcabil]] peoples and with [[Mashick]]. Through the sixteenth century several wayports along the west Cappatian coastline were established by said traders, some of which would grow into substantial staddomain settlements.

The death of Tavancine Emperor Cariwasari in 1660 is suspected to have been an assassination carried out on Morrack orders, purportedly to allow for more profitable trade in silver—Morrack was at the time running low on funds to support their ongoing wars in [[Vascony]] and [[Libya]].

In the twentieth century, a collaboration between alchemists at the Branwen Sanatory in [[New Leudong]] and the University of Rimack in Tavancy led to the discovery of cozebdone-diamaschal benjamine (in pill form familiarly called "CD" or, in [[Markland]], "Tommy pills") as an effective hebetant without significant adversions.
