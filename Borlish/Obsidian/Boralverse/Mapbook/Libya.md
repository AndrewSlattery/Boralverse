Libya is a [[Middlesea]] polity on the north coast of [[Africa]], located between [[Morrack]] to the west and [[Egypt]] to the east.

# History
During the [[Second Tetrarchy]]  of the early second millennium, Libya (under the name Ifricia) was an important admiralty of the [[Single Caliphate]], ruled from [[Tunis]]. As imperial hegemony in [[Europe]] and northern Africa began to fall apart, so did the Single Caliphate; an independent admiralty in Libya was declared in 1237 (at roughly the same time as the Morrove admiralty to the west).

Although Libya's navy was not yet trading directly with the Novomund in the sixteenth century, seamen from the region were commonly employed in the merchant fleets of Morrack and (especially) of [[Provence]].   

In the early seventeenth century, the banner of Libya comprised two black fields, one white and one orange. At this time, the polity warred intermittently with Morrack over control of trade into the eastern Middlesea.

In the modern day, Libya is a significant refiner and exporter of cuproses.
