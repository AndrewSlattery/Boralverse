**New Leudong** (Welsh: *Leudong Newð* /ˌlyːˈdɔŋ ˈnawð/) is a polity covering the southeast portion of [[Chrysia]]. Named for the [[Cathay|Cathayan]] state of Leudong, it has experienced significant Cathayan nation-building alongside [[British]] settlement since the late seventeenth century. In the early eighteenth century the trade network of [[Gurjat]] extended as far as New Leudong. Born in New Leudong, mixed-heritage writer [[Pether Hetsong]] penned semi-autobiographical work The Land of Golden Lies and Sugared Fire in 1864, often considered the first Chrysian work of literature to enjoy [[Vetomund|Vetomundine]] success. New Leudong was an early adopter of the new social mores of the [[Household Renovation]] in the late nineteenth century. A collaboration involving the [[Branwen Sanatory]] in New Leudong's capital invented the chemical painkiller cozebdone-diamaschal benjamine. In the late twentieth century the New Leudong city of [[Mehannin]] became a technological hub, spurring developments in grimmer design and methodics.
