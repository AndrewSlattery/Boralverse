# History
Markland originates with Saxon settlements in sub-Roman Britannia, which in the west formed (what would go on to be named) *mearce land* "borderland". Compare the related demonym *Mierce* "people of the border", whence the Latin name *Mercia* and native *Merchman* "man from Markland".

The petty kingdom of Anglia was annexed by Markland with the [[Treaty of Oxford]] in the late eighth century, at the dawn of the Viking Age. This established the persevering border between the mouths of the Severn and the Tames, and incited renewed influx of people into the petty kingdoms on [[Borland]].

Markland weathered the Viking Age much more successfully than neighbouring Northumber, though much of its eastern coast was settled by Danes; the city of Lincon served as the de facto border of Danish rule for several decades. In part this was the inevitable result of tensions along the Welsh border; even during peacetime Theodric the Awefast maintained substantial levy forces.

The tenth-century [[Elved Marriage]] (which took place near the modern city of Leeds) ended hostilities between Markland and Dane forces in the east for almost a century. It is said to have been solemnised over a sandstone block later inlaid into the [[Redstone Chair]], a low-backed wooden throne on which many subsequent monarchs were crowned.

Around the turn of the second millennium, Markland was conquering territory from the northern reaches of Wales (incidentally leading to Pope Agatho's canonisation of the Welsh St David). The perennial conflicts between Markland and Wales would come to be collectively referred to as the [[Mallor Wars]].

The [[First Drengot Empire]] of the eleventh and twelfth centuries counted Markland as a major vassal, conquered from the south following the subjugation of [[Kent]] by [[Normandy]] and [[Devon|Greater Devon]] in 1029.

The Mallor Wars were reignited after a quiescent period by the martial-minded [[Andrew II of Markland|King Andrew II]], with the [[Sack of Rexam]] in 1301 during which the original St Brigid's Abbey burned to the ground.

Markland was embroiled in the [[Wars of Fealty]] in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Tensions over the location and possession of the Redstone Chair boiled over into a conflict that would last forty-one years. Markland conceded several battles to the young [[Britain|Kingdom of Britain]] in the early years of the wars, culminating in the 1483 [[Battle of Rexam (1483)|Battle of Rexam]] which expanded the borders of Wales in the north and killed the last Duke of Chestre.

In the final years of the Wars of Fealty, a code known as Thieves' Script was employed by the forces of [[Andrew III of Markland|King Andrew III]], apparently adapted from similar systems used by gangs of housebreakers in Nottingham. It is remembered today as a very early precursor of codes like steeplescript or modern one-zeffre encoding.

The poor economic conditions and population displacement in Markland following the Wars of Featly led it to suffer almost twice as many deaths per capita from the [[Second Great Dying]] compared to polities like [[Willemy]].

Long contested between Markland and Kent, the city of [[London]] found itself independent for one final, lasting time following the [[Democratic Wars]] of the mid-eighteenth century.

The spellings of various towns and cities in Markland were rationalised during the [[Long Peace]] period of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries (for example, Conster for former Colncester /ˈkɔn.stə/).

The 2010 Œcumen Count, a regular census, recorded that Utter Safford was the secondmost populous city in Markland proper with 4.4 million inhabitants, after the capital of [[Tommarth]].
