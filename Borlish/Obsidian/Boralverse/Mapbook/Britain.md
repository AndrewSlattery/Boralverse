Britain (Cambrick **Prydein**) is a polity of [[Albion]] centred on [[Wales]] but extending through [[Devon]] and [[Dunclothe]] and out to [[Kernow]] and parts of [[Ireland]].

## History

The Kingdom of Britain was founded in the fifteenth century, formalising the suzerainty of Wales over the tallaths of Devon and Dunclothe. The state profited greatly from the [[Wars of Fealty]] of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries which raged across the rest of [[Albion]].

Britain's economic success at this time drove ventures in [[Africa]]. Resupply ports along the western coast eventually allowed for the flourishing of direct sea trade between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].

The seventeenth century saw the dawn of British exploration of the [[Novomund]], founding staddomains along the southern Gulf. These would coalesce into several polities known collectively as [[British Mendeva]] over the next centuries, the largest of which is [[Hasiny]]. Britain here found itself in conflict with [[Provence]]'s settlements on the east coast; for example, the [[Sack of Santrafew]] was undertaken by an alliance of British and Mastoiset forces. 

After the [[Chrysian Landfall]], emigration from Britain (along with more formal state-building enterprise from [[Cathay]]) helped form the modern polity of [[New Leudong]].

In the latter years of the nineteenth century, [[British Mendeva]] overtook Britain in population and industry. Nonetheless, Britain retained some cultural prestige over the Novomundine polities. In part this was sustained via migration of many members of the 'new rich' across the Atlantic, and the resultant intertwining of the respective upper-class societies through marriage. It is debated whether this prestige accelerated the export of [[Household Renovation]] social mores from Britain to Mendeva.
