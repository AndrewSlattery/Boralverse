Drawing in the Sand: the History of Calculation (originally written in Napolitan as Scheme ne Rene: a Storia d'Amiradanza) is a collaborative reference book published in 1954 by the Agenza Scholaria Fodgesa. It follows the development of numerical methods from prehistory and antiquity, up to the paradigm shift of the past few decades.

…the lengthy process of multiplication in tesquo to the much-easier addition and subtraction. For several centuries, the method of choice required two-way circular function enumerations—specifically, [[Nadim of Trapoles]]'s identity:

Notice that the only required calculations are addition, subtraction, and applying/removing arrhumb. Although Nadim's own enumeration of arrhumb is lost to time, we retain similiar and almost-contemporaneous documents. Most famously, [[Jambor of Awry]]'s great [[Library of Sobjan]] received a transcription of the 1261 N *liber numerorum* compiled by the [[Saint Marinus]] scholars.

You may have noticed a restriction on what this method allows us to multiply; indeed, we can only remove arrhumb from a and b if they are sized less than 1 each. However, this is not a real roadblock, as we can simply scale our two multiplicands as necessary. For example, to multiply 2567 and 9081, we instead find the product of 0.2567 and 0.9081, and in the end rescale to the correct magnitude.

The Trapolitan identity is a straightforward consequence of the more-familiar angle addition identities first recorded by the [[Gurjat]] mathematicians at [[Ujén]] in the tenth century. The timeline by which knowledge regarding circular function diffused to the west is uncertain and contested. Ambiguous references in pre-establishment [[Portingale]] writing are held up by some as…
