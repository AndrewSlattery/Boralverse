High Society is a play written by [[Alburg]] playwright [[Absolon Mortenszen]] and first performed in 1560 N. It is set in summertime [[Barcelon]].

The play was very well received at the time; the royal family altered their in-progress Grand Tour of the [[Dane Concert]] on short notice in order to view the production.
