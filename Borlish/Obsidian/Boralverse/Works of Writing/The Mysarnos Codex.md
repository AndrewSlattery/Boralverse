The Mysarnos Codex is an illustrated manuscript written entirely in an unfamiliar script which eluded decipherment for centuries.
## Context
The Codex was composed in the sixteenth century and first stored by somebody (presumably a monk) at the Library of Saint George the Martyr, one of the largest buildings in the sprawling church complex located north of the city of Mysarnos.

Mysarnos was at the time the capital of Mystra, a mordether vassal of the Roman Empire. Located at the western end of the Athenian Way, Mysarnos flourished as a hub for the Revitalist movement during the sixteenth century, receiving half of all Greece's imports and swelling to a population of nearly thirty thousand.
## Authorship
The author of the Mysarnos Codex has never been conclusively identified, although several candidates have been nominated. Despite extant and complete membership records for the area's monasteries, no mention is made of the production of the Codex in contemporary chronicles.
## Content
The Codex is thought to have originally comprised over two hundred vellum illustrated folios (several are lost but gaps can be deduced from various tallies). The illustrations include both mundane scenes such as poppy fields as well as fantastical vistas like armoured men on dragonback.

The text consists of a set of approximately 180 different glyphs (there is disagreement on whether some pairs of glyphs are mere variants or indeed separate), arranged into words and paragraphs.
## Decipherment
For centuries scholars presumed the Mysarnos glyphs to have been entirely invented by their author. The [[Good Game]] period of the late nineteenth century saw this narrative collapse, with artefacts first from old Pylos (by then a neighbourhood of Mysarnos) and then from Crete surfacing bearing the same glyphs.

It became clear that the author of the Mysarnos Codex had had access to a store of writing in this script, and perhaps had even known how to read it (many words within the Codex matched the truly ancient examples). The revelation that the Mysarnos glyphs were being used to write a form of Greek only came in 1939, with the unearthing of the lost First Folio at the venerable Library of Sobjan. This text began with a fictionalised biography of the author written both in contemporary Greek and in the codex's script, which allowed for direct comparison and thence, with work, a full decipherment.
