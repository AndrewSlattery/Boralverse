Men of Jet and Diamond (originally published in Welsh under the title **Dynnon o Vuhuð a Diamont**) is an 1890 trevold written by [[Hasiny|Hasinick]] Welshman [[Cadogan Torrior]], shortly after he graduated from the [[University of Nadacou]] as a scholar of diplomacy.

Published by Blackburn Editions, the work is a rather late member of the first wave of [[Masquira romance|masquira romance]]. The book was modestly popular in eastern [[Mendeva]], but became much more widely known after being adapted by a [[New Provence]] guild into the wildly-succesful 1951 film 'Jet White' (New Provincial **Blanc Sabaje**).

## Excerpts
> It would have been an exaggeration to say that the hotel's lobby was crowded. Nonetheless, Zoe Pentross found she couldn't take a seat without inserting herself into someone's lively conversation or another's relaxed solitude. Instead she remained standing at the bar, keys in her left hand and a gratifyingly-good Empordan wine in her right.
> 
> "Are you here to see the new King arrive in Nadacou?" A tall, slender man joins Zoe at the bar, signalling the tender for a refill.
> 
> "Not to see His Grace, per se," Zoe demurs, taking the opportunity to turn and look properly at her new companion. Dark hair, closely-shorn—not typical among those with long family ties in the area, though his complexion suggested he wasn't entirely foreign.
> 
> "Ah, of course!" The smile that spreads across the man's face is charming and curious. Someone delighted at mystery, perhaps, or at least someone willing to humour it for the sake of conversation. "You plan to stand one street over from tomorrow's parade, I take it?"


> Half an hour, far too much shockled cake and a generous glass of limmon acquetta later, Zoe strode out of the new unmanned lifter and peered at the ornate signposts. The key in her hand was helpfully inscribed with a fullaw bird and the number four in neat script, so she turned down the corresponding corridor until she found her door, set discreetly into the wall.
> 
> Inside, the set of rooms (really, not much more than a small parlour and a bed in an alcove) was decorated in the latest Morrack fashions, all exposed stonework draped in tapestries and curtains. The ewer in the corner even had a handle in the shape of a viper.
