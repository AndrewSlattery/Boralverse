Waging World Peace (originally published in Borlish as **Paç Mondial Accommettent**) is a 1968 trevold written by [[Neuvort]] writer [[Dion Becolla]]. It was published during the [[General Italian Fervour]] of the late 1960s and early 1970s, but it some respects it owes more to the [[Masquira romance|masquira]] genre, particularly in its 1880s setting at the heart of the [[Good Game]] period.

## Excerpts
> "Lucas Marcuszen?" Mr. Barracat said, when he heard Benjamin's choice for his new partner. "Good choice. But there is something you should know before making a final decision."
> 
> "I'm already aware he's Danish, sir," Benjamin said. A number of the other Vascon agents took issue with Lucas' nationality, suggesting that, at best, he could only be trusted as long as JY's interests weren't in open conflict with the Collusion's. Benjamin sometimes wondered why they assumed that, if the Good Game became violent, JY would automatically side with Vascony. It was an international organisation, after all. Any of them could face divided loyalties. "And he's still on good terms with them, so he must at least nominally be a subject."
> 
> Barracat brushed that aside. "All of the Danish agents are. Marcuszen, however, is also an admitted thayen."

> "Let's take a spin on the dance floor before dessert, shall we?” Benjamin said. He and Martha had cleared their plates, and there was no point prolonging what remained of the conversation—in that respect Lucas' date seemed impossibly to be going better than his. Yvette was at least pretending to pay attention to Lucas' monologue.
> 
> Martha agreed, having clearly come to a similar conclusion. To his surprise, she proved a good dancer, with light steps and a good sense of timing. As the next song started, he saw Yvette dragging Lucas onto the dance floor. Benjamin noted with approval that he held her right hand in an awkward, crushing grip—the compromise they'd reached over Lucas' unwillingness to tread on her feet. Apparently, while he had no objection to being dull, he drew the line at clumsy.
> 
> Benjamin supposed it was just as well. Feigned clumsiness wouldn't have been believable to anyone who had seen him fight. Despite the cheap suit and the wrinkled shirt, Lucas fit in on the dance floor—sleek and graceful. Maybe enough so that Yvette would consider it worth suffering through his conversation.
