**Children of the Battle of [[Rexam]]** (released in [[Merch]] as *Chulder oth Feight at Rexam* /ˈtʃʊl.də‿ɾʊð fɛʃt ət ˈɾɛk.səm/, and originally published in [[Welsh]] as P*a Ðywdan y Plant Car Vantel* /pa ðəuˈdɔn ə plant kaː vənˈtɛɬ/ "What the Children of Rexam Said") is a sensation trevold written by [[Jon Paldreth]] and published in 1931. It is a fictionalised account of the orphaned children of the [[Duke of Chester]] in the decades following his death at the 1483 [[Battle of Rexam (1483)|Battle of Rexam]]. By Paldreth's account, the children met practically every famous personage in contemporary western [[Europe]], from [[Guillen daus Sanz|General daus Sanz]] to King [[Andrew III of Markland]] (in fairness, the eldest child was indeed briefly a hostage of the then-prince Andrew). Moreover, Paldreth contrives to have the children present at almost every significant historical event of the time; unlikely as this all is, the book has enjoyed much use in school history lessons as an approachable introduction to the politics of the time.
