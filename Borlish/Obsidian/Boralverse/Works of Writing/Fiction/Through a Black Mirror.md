Through a Black Mirror (originally in Saxon as **Durgh'nen Shorzen Shouer**) is an early example of parachthon romance, written by first-time author [[Elsebeth Sneider]] in 1795. Its immediate popularity sparked the [[Voidtale|voidtale]] craze, which persisted until the [[Second German War]]. The title is a quote from 1 Corinthians.

The book stars Adelaide, a young woman who is whisked away with her sister and her friends on an adventure among the stars with a strange man known only as 'Captain'.

Words which are first attested in this book include xenic, xenozon and gyre.

- Though we see now as through a black mirror, yet shall we be in sight together. Though I know now but in parts, yet I shall know all as I am known to God. \[Forenote, from 1 Corinthians\]
- “Look through the glass, into the dark! Find me a star with no name, that we might pen the first chapter of its story.”
- And all at once Adelaide understood the terrible infinitude cast out before her. She could let the Captain lose her under any xenic sky, and become at once and entirely the most isolated person in history.

  Then Adelaide promptly understood. "Surely not," she muttered, as she saw the interior. It was all smooth metal: a sort of vaulted corridor, triangular in shape, with—perhaps nameplates—on the walls. Further down the polished vestibule were—
  
  "Surely *not*," she said again more pointedly, as she saw what was there—across the large hall, past the odd tables and glass frames, there was a window. An enormous window with dark, empty space beyond it. Except it wasn't dark, not quite.
  
  It was lit by thousands of stars.
