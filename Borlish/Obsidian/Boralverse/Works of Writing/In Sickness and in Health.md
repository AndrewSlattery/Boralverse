In Sickness and in Health: Medicine in pre-Arnoutszen Europe is a quire chronicling the development of medical practice in [[Europe]] from antiquity until the time of physician [[Laurz Arnoutszen]] in the sixteenth century (the adoption of whose techniques constituted a sea-change in the effectiveness of medicine).

It was written by Andrew Knowles in the mid-twentieth century. It was published in Kent by Winchester Scholastic Primers in multiple editions; the second edition was released in 1961 with a foreword by Dr Laura Norris, a lecturer in Heredity at Canterburgh University.

… the death of up to one-fifth of the population.

Of course, despite the name, not everywhere in Europe suffered so badly from the [[Second Great Dying]] as did [[Portingale]]. Those more inland areas, such as [[Boham]] and [[Burgundy]] (having lost its coastal territory to House Amigòt in 1499) endured far fewer casualties simply by virtue of being further from the main mode of transmission: naval trade. It was not by chance that the first recorded death attributable to this plague was in [[Damvath]] in [[Borland]], said at the time to be the most-trafficked port city outside the [[Middlesea]].

It is a common misconception, popularised further by the famous scene in Maresca's 1931 film Frutto Amaro (Bitter Fruit), that people blamed cats and dogs for the sickness sweeping the continent. This idea, first attested in connection with the Second Great Dying only several decades after the fact, perhaps originated with the tale of the monastery at Bonn, which after several deaths to an “unknown illness” in 1512 (probably luetic pox) banished all animals from the monastery and (unsuccessfully) from the neighbouring village, claiming they were a Satanic influence.

In fact, the reaction to the Dying varied significantly across Europe. The countries of [[Albion]], having for the most part escaped the first continental plague the century before, and furthermore still recovering from the [[Wars of Fealty]], were perhaps the least prepared for an epidemic, and indeed…
