## Excerpts
> Question 1: How did [[Britain]] retain its position of cultural prestige over [[British Mendeva]] during the final years of the nineteenth century even as the latter overtook Britain in population and industry, and to what extent were the ethics of the [[Household Renovation]] exported to the [[Novomund]] via this cachet?
> 
> - for the first, look for talk of increased transmigration of the new rich across the Atlantic and rates of intermarriage thereamongst.
> - further, reward mention of the boom of the Vetomundine [[Masquira romance|masquira]] genre and how it displaced the autochthonous [[Herdtale romance|herdtale]] tradition (specifically look for reference to Cosωteg's [[Hasiny]] diaries).
> - for the second, only give credit to responses highlighting the ongoing debate as to the timeline of Laic adoption in [[Gulf Mendeva]]; at least two disagreeing authors must be mentioned.
> 
> Question 2: Discuss the rise of the [[New Urban Mesh]] and their subsumption into the [[Drengot Collusion|Collusion]], with emphasis on the growth of [[London]] following the [[Global Workshop]] period. In particular, compare the popular account of their use of espionage in the East to steer politics in tradewise-beneficial directions with the likely reality.
> 
> - give credit for emphasising the role of maritime technology and especially access to coal in supporting the Urban trade.
> - look for responses which prove that the student has done more than watch 1968 film “[[Mr Desarden, Prince Consort]]”; that they are actually familiar with [[James Desarden]]'s career in the City Administration both before his assignment to [[Nackon Day]] and after the scandal of 1887.
