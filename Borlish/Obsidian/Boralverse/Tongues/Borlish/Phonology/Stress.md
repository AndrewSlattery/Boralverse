The final syllable is usually stressed.
‹scadom tatover›
/xaˈdɔm ˌta.toˈvɛr/
'tomato potato'

In words of four or more syllables, secondary stress is usually assigned in iambs, although anapaestic patterns do occur when the interior syllables are sufficiently light.
‹deborsellar haubrjoranç›
/deˌbɔr.sɛˈlar ˌhob.r̩.ʒoˈrants/
'pickpocket advertisement'

There are some exceptions to final stress. Syllabic consonants reject stress onto the previous syllable. Moreover, the suffixes **-(e)nt** (forming present participles of **-r** conjugation verbs), **-(e)nç** (forming nouns from the same verbs) and **-essem, -errem** (forming comparatives) also enforce penultimate stress.
‹casn pardenç pessem veðerrem›
/ˈkazn̩ ˈpar.dɛnts ˈpɛ.sɛm veˈðɛ.rɛm/
'oak loss worse elder'

In many dialects these suffixes are parsimoniously analysed as instead containing syllabic consonants, pronounced as /-n̩t -n̩ts -ɛs.m̩ -ɛr.m̩/.
