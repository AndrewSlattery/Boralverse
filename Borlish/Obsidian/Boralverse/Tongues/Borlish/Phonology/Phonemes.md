### Consonants
Borlish has a consonant inventory of middling size. Notable is the presence of /ʒ/ without its voiceless counterpart /ʃ/, due to a relatively recent sound change which backed the latter to /x/.

| m   |     | n   |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| p b |     | t d |     | k g |     |
|     |     | ts  |     |     |     |
| f v | θ ð | s z | ʒ   | x   | h   |
| w¹  |     | l   | j   | r²  |     |

- ¹In native vocabulary the phoneme /w/ appears only after /k/. This, along with alternations like
‹voc voccar | bocq bocquar›
/vɔk vɔˈkar | bɔk bɔˈkwar/
'summons {to summon} | fee {to charge}'

have led some to analyse /kw/ sequences as a single phoneme /kʷ/ which merges with /k/ in coda position.
- ² The rhotic is uvular, but for ease we will denote it by /r/ in phonemic transcription.
### Vowels
Borlish has eight monophthong vowel phonemes, typical of neighbouring Germanic and sister Gallo-Romance languages.

| i   | ɪ   | u   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| e   |     | o   |
| ɛ   | a   | ɔ   |

Borlish also contains the diphthong /au/, as well as vowel+/j/ sequences that may be analysed as diphthongs.

The segments /m n r/ can appear as syllabic consonants.
‹batesm cohernt outrscac›
/baˈtɛz.m̩ koˈhɛr.n̩t ˌut.r̩ˈxak/
'baptism consequent brazen'

The syllable preceding a syllabic consonant acts as a closed syllable, and the segment before a syllabic consonant acts as part of the coda of the previous syllable. Hence, it is usually considered most elegant to syllabify so that syllabic consonants have no onset.
