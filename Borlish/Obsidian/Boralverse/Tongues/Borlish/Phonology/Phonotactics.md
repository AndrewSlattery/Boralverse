There are several restrictions on where in a syllable or a word certain segments can appear. The consonants /v s ʒ h/ do not occur in coda position, and /ð/ does not occur word-finally. When morphology would place /ð s ʒ/ in a forbidden position they are replaced with /θ z x/ respectively.
‹nað-ar nað | fass-ar fas | naj-ar nascn›
/naˈðar naθ | faˈsar faz | naˈʒar ˈnax.n̩/
'swim-inf swim.s | wrap-inf wrap.s | sail-inf sail.3p'

When morphology would place /v/ in a forbidden position, either /f/ replaces it or the preceding vowel is altered.
‹cav-ir caf | bav-ar bau›
/kaˈvɪr kaf | baˈvar bo/
'get-inf get.s | bark-inf bark.s'

Syllabic consonants do not occur in stressed or initial syllables, and the 'lax' vowels /ɪ ɛ ɔ/ do not occur in stressed open syllables.
### Onsets
Any vowel can begin an initial syllable, but under most analyses non-initial syllables must begin with a consonant.
‹al enç aiç il eir onc aust ou›
/al ɛnts ets ɪl ir ɔnk ost u/
'wing start ease they go hook east egg'

Any single consonant may constitute an onset. Two-consonant onsets are of three kinds: for the first, the second segment is a liquid (one of /l j r/; the case of /w/ is dealt with above), preceded either by a stop or a fricative. The liquid /l/ does not occur after the segments /t d θ ð ʒ/, and the liquid /r/ does not occur after the segments /ð s z ʒ/.
‹plait droug gien thron›
/plet druj ʒjɛn θrɔn/
'pleased contribution cheek throne'

The second class of two-consonant onsets are a heterorganic stop followed by one of /s θ t d/; these usually derive from Greek.
‹xyron chthonic ptyssoscia bdella›
/ksiˈrɔn kθɔˈnɪk ˌpti.soˈxja bdɛˈla/
'scalpel subterraneous glaucoma virus'

The remaining two-consonant onsets comprise /s/ followed by a nasal, a stop, the two liquids /l j/ or the two fricatives /f v/.
‹smout skore sdegn slanc siesc sforç svam›
/smut skoˈre sdɪjn slank sjɛx sfɔrts svam/
'riot urgent scorn thin siege strain sponge'

All the possible three-consonant onsets are formed by the combination of /s/+consonant and consonant+liquid onsets.
‹splorar spien sdruçol sfrey›
/sploˈrar spjɛn sdriˈtsɔl sfri/
'explore hope lubrication horror'

No more complex onsets are permitted.
### Codas
Empty codas are permitted, including word-finally. However, the 'lax' vowels /ɪ ɛ ɔ/ do not occur in final open syllables (as these would necessarily be stressed).
‹idone nijomm-au›
/ˌi.doˈne ˌni.ʒɔˈmo/
'suitable bind-pst'

Any single consonant except /v s ʒ h/ may be a coda. There are several types of two-consonant coda. A liquid may be followed by any non-liquid that can appear in codas at all; a nasal by any such non-liquid and non-nasal.
‹sculd tragç corf lucern | hamt coyenç ans›
/xɪld trɛjts kɔrf liˈtsɛrn | hamt koˈjɛnts anz/
'obligation clue raven lantern | live.s prevention handle'

The fricative /s/ may precede a voiceless stop; /f/ may precede /t/ specifically.
‹cosp fest masq | haft›
/kɔsp fɛst mask | haft/
'{bee sting} banquet disguise | busy'

Conversely, /s/ may also follow any voiceless stop; after /t/ this is identical to the affricate phoneme /ts/.
‹laps ouç jex›
/laps uts ʒɛks/
'mistake silence bullseye'

Finally among two-consonant codas, the cluster /kt/ is also permitted.
‹abject›
/abˈʒɛkt/
'despicable'

The few three-consonant codas that appear are a nasal or /j/ with a licit two-consonant cluster.
‹boist deunx defonct›
/bɔjst daunks deˈfɔnkt/
'box {near miss} deceased'

No more complex codas are permitted.
