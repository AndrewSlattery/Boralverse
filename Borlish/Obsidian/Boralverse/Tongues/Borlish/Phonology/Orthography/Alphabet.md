### Special Characters
The character ‹w›, which is used in foreign words and some names (like *Willaum* 'William'), is pronounced like ‹v› and called *vescon* 'second-vee'. There are also some compound characters. The ligatures **‹æ œ›**, primarily used in Classical loanwords, are called *æsc* and *œthel* respectively and pronounced as if written ‹e›. The character ‹ï› is referred to as *i jammel* 'twin i' and pronounced as if written ‹yi›.
