Divide written vowels into two groups. Free vowels are either word-final or separated from the next vowel in the word by a single consonant letter (or one of ‹sc ch th›).
‹choma epu idiocy nothe›
/koˈma eˈpi ˌi.djoˈtsi noˈθe/
'gnome express stupidity illegitimate'

Checked vowels are either in a final closed syllable or separated from the next vowel in the word by at least two consonant letters.
‹commun ambasctour sincer›
/kɔˈmɪn ˌam.baxˈtur sɪnˈtsɛr/
'ordinary emissary genuine'

First consider the letters ‹a e i o u y› when they occur alone (not part of a digraph). When they are free, ‹a e i o u y› are pronounced /a e i o i i/.
‹cla vige bro cru try›
/kla viˈʒe bro kri tri/
'key wealthy dude raw turn'

When they are checked, ‹a e i o u y› are pronounced /a ɛ ɪ ɔ ɪ ɪ/.
‹vindron vampyr effus›
/vɪnˈdrɔn vamˈpɪr ɛˈfɪz/
'vintner vampire extensive'

Between a consonant and one of the vowels ‹a e o u›, the letters ‹i u› denote the semivowel /j/. The letter ‹u› denotes the semivowel /w/ specifically after ‹q›.
‹diac suet quelt›
/djak sjɛt kwɛlt/
'mic familiar dinner'
#### Vowel digraphs
The digraphs ‹au eu ou› are pronounced /o au u/ respectively. The rarer ‹ao eo› share their pronunciation with ‹eu›.
‹taur teun tout | paon theory›
/tor taun tut | paun thauˈri/
'bull scant everything | peacock science'

The digraphs ‹ai ei oi ui› and ‹ay ey oy uy› are pronounced /e i ɔj aj/ respectively. Intervocalically ‹y› does double duty, simultaneously affecting the previous vowel as stated and acting as an onset /j/.
‹deit joivr | rayon huyaç›
/dit ˈʒɔjv.r̩ | reˈjɔn haˈjats/
'finger frost | sunbeam corruption'

The vast majority of coda ‹g› and many other ‹g› before consonants form vowel digraphs. Here, the digraphs ‹ag eg ig og ug aug oug› are usually pronounced /ɛj ɪj aj ɔj aj oj uj/ respectively.
‹bag deg rig pog tug faug voug›
/bɛj dɪj raj pɔj taj foj vuj/
'berry ten queue few passion sickle wrong'

However, there are exceptions where a ‹g› in one of the above environments is read consonantally.
‹magr magr | migrar scigrar›
/ˈmag.r̩ ˈmɛj.r̩ | mɪˈgrar xajˈrar/
'rash scarce | migrate redistrict'
