Note: ‹y› is considered a vowel when written between consonants and/or word boundaries, and a consonant otherwise.

### Consonants
The following letters regularly denote a single phoneme.

| Letter | Phoneme | Letter | Phoneme |
| ------ | ------- | ------ | ------- |
| b      | /b/     | m      | /m/     |
| ç      | /ts/    | n      | /n/     |
| d      | /d/     | p      | /p/     |
| f      | /f/     | q      | /k/     |
| j      | /ʒ/     | r      | /r/     |
| k      | /k/     | v      | /v/     |
| l      | /l/     | z      | /z/     |

Of these, the letters ‹b d f l m n p r› may appear doubled, which usually does not affect their pronunciation.
‹abbað joddy affis ollom commet bannir çoppin arrum›
/aˈbaθ ʒɔˈdi aˈfɪz ɔˈlɔm kɔˈmɛt baˈnɪr tsɔˈpɪn aˈrɪm/
'abbot cuppa tip relic ban start toffee cosine'

The only exception to this is that ‹mm nn rr› may denote a single consonant followed by a syllabic consonant. This is the reading when ‹mm nn rr› occurs word-finally or before a consonant.
‹yem-m grin-n car-r›
/ˈjɛm.m̩ ˈgrɪn.n̩ ˈkar.r̩/
'get-1p judge-3p seek-inf'

The letter ‹ð› is pronounced /θ/ word-finally and /ð/ otherwise.
‹arð naðr ðeu›
/arθ ˈnað.r̩ ðau/
'steep viper buttocks'

The letter ‹x› regularly denotes the phoneme sequence /ks/.
‹xivol euxon incox›
/ksiˈvɔl auˈksɔn ɪnˈkɔks/
'waltz quartz digestion'

Consider the final six letters ‹c g h s t y› when they occur alone (not part of a digraph). In this case, the letters ‹t y› regularly denote /t j/ respectively. The letter /t/ may be doubled, without any effect on its pronunciation.
‹tien yoc | cattin›
/tjɛn jɔk | kaˈtɪn/
'yours husband | kitten'

The letter ‹c› is pronounced /ts/ before ‹e i y› and /k/ otherwise. The doubled ‹cc› is pronounced /kts/ before ‹e i y› and /k/ otherwise.
‹cigl cuivr bac | accaç occeir›
/tsajl ˈkajv.r̩  bak | aˈkats ɔkˈtsir/
'darling copper twig | post kill'

The letter ‹g› may be pronounced as either of /g ʒ/ before ‹e i y› and is pronounced /g/ otherwise. The doubled ‹gg› may be pronounced as either of /g gʒ/ before ‹e i y› and is pronounced /g/ otherwise.
‹gevou genoil tenguð | suggesson›
/geˈvu ʒeˈnɔjl tɛnˈgɪθ | ˌsɪg.ʒɛˈsɔn/
'{watch out} knee bauble | suggestion'

The letter ‹h› is either pronounced /h/ or is silent (the latter only in some vocabulary inherited from Latin and after vocalic ‹g›).
‹heu hom augher›
/hau ɔm oˈjɛr/
'mien person tumbler'

The letter ‹s› is pronounced /z/ in coda position or between vowels, and /s/ otherwise or when doubled.
‹bevis bosaç bustr | bossir›
/beˈvɪz boˈzats ˈbɪst.r̩  | bɔˈsɪr/
'banknote gunfire example | gentleman'
#### Consonant digraphs
The six letters, ‹c g h s t y›, combine with other letters to form digraphs. The sequences ‹sc ch th› regularly denote the phonemes /x k θ/. The potentially ambiguous sequence ‹sch› is read /sk/.
‹sclar chym thral | schol›
/xlar kɪm θral | skɔl/
'lightning lymph slave | school'

The sequence ‹cq› is pronounced /k/.
‹jalicq jacquot›
/ʒaˈlɪk ʒaˈkwɔt/
