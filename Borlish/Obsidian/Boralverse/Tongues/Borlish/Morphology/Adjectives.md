Borlish adjectives have two forms: a base form and a comparative form. The comparative is formed by adding a suffix, which shifts stress to the penultimate syllable.
### Regular Comparative in -essem

The regular comparative suffix is **-essem**, which replaces or follows the final segment of the adjective and attracts penultimate stress.
‹leger legeressem›
/leˈʒɛr ˌle.ʒeˈrɛ.sɛm/
'light lighter'

Several orthographic adjustments may occur when the suffix is added. Before the vowel-initial suffix, ‹ç› becomes ‹c›, while ‹c› becomes ‹ch› to preserve the /k/ pronunciation.
‹lavaç lavacessem | starc starchessem›
/laˈvats ˌla.vaˈtsɛ.sɛm | stark starˈkɛ.sɛm/
'wasteful {more wasteful} | strong stronger'

After a final orthographic ‹-q›, a linking ‹-u-› is inserted.
‹picq picquessem›
/pɪk pɪˈkwɛ.sɛm/
'small smaller'

The final consonant may be doubled in the comparative form to maintain the checked quality of the preceding vowel. This occurs most commonly with final ‹-l›.
‹boncop boncoppessem›
/bɔnˈkɔp ˌbɔn.kɔˈpɛ.sɛm/
'cheap cheaper'

The final consonant may be voiced in the comparative form. This is seen most commonly in present participles ending in ‹-nt› (which form comparatives in ‹-ndessem›) and in adjectives ending in fricatives, though only final ‹-f› reflects this orthographically as ‹-vessem›.
‹tart tardessem | braf bravessem›
/tart tarˈdɛ.sɛm | braf braˈvɛ.sɛm/
'late later | brave braver'

Adjectives ending in a written ‹-Vu› diphthong form the comparative in ‹-Vvessem›.
‹blau blavessem›
/blo blaˈvɛ.sɛm/
'blue bluer'

Certain historically long vowels in the final syllable of an adjective may shorten in the comparative form. This occurs most commonly with adjectives ending in ‹-ous›.
‹fatuous fatuosessem›
/faˈtjuz ˌfa.tjoˈzɛ.sɛm/
'clumsy clumsier'

Adjectives ending in ‹-e› form the comparative in ‹-eyessem›.
‹idone idoneyessem›
/ˌi.doˈne ˌi.doˈnjɛ.sɛm/
'convenient {more convenient}'

### Adjectives in Syllabic -r

Adjectives ending in syllabic ‹-r› show several patterns. Occasionally they form regular comparatives in ‹-ressem›.
‹jundr jundressem›
/ˈʒɪn.dr̩ ʒɪnˈdrɛ.sɛm/
'junior {more junior}'

Some adjectives, most notably those ending in the suffix ‹-abr› "-able", form comparatives in ‹-lessem› rather than ‹-ressem›.
‹stabr stablessem | sengr senglessem›
/ˈstab.r̩ staˈblɛ.sɛm | ˈsɛn.gr̩ sɛnˈglɛ.sɛm/
'steady steadier | simple simpler'

The majority of adjectives ending in syllabic ‹-r› form the comparative with the suffix ‹-errem›, which replaces the final syllabic consonant and is stressed penultimately. The same adjustments that affect ‹-essem› may also affect ‹-errem›.
‹nuvr nuverrem | diçr dicerrem›
/ˈnɪv.r̩ niˈvɛ.rɛm | ˈdɪts.r̩ diˈtsɛ.rɛm/
'fresh fresher | great greater'

‹allagr allagherrem | leur leverrem›
/aˈlɛj.r̩ ˌa.lɛˈjɛ.rɛm | ˈlau.r̩ leˈvɛ.rɛm/
'happy happier | free freer'

### Irregular Comparatives

A few adjectives show irregular stem changes in the comparative.
‹brey bressem›
/bri ˈbrɛ.sɛm/
'short shorter'

Several common adjectives have fully suppletive comparative forms.
‹bon ottem | mal pessem | gran maissem›
/bɔn ˈɔ.tɛm | mal ˈpɛ.sɛm | gran ˈme.sɛm/
'good better | bad worse | big bigger'
