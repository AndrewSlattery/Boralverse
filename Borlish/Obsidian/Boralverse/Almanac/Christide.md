Christide (also the Nativity) is the Christian celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ.

Christide is the day after [[Revillon]], a feast day celebrated particularly on [[Borland]]. Aside from the Midnight Mass which follows the Revillon Feast, the rest of Christide on Borland is usually spent resting and recovering (although the Revillon festivities may continue through the next day especially in major cities). 

One of the primary symbols of Christide on the island is butterflies (as a representation of metamorphosis and new life as the dead world of winter grows again into spring). The dalassine-sweet 'sugared butterflies' are traditionally eaten on Christide.
