Revillon (Borlish **Reveglon** /ˌre.vijˈlɔn/) is the Borlish term for the eve (and often the entire day) before [[Christide]]. It refers also to the specific cultural practice on the island of the Winter Feast (**y Fest Reveglon**), a celebration held on Revillon in churches across the land to which everyone in attendance brings food.

The Borlish name **Reveglon** means "vigil", and is a Middle Boral borrowing from the synonymous French **reveillon**, itself originally from Latin **evigilō** "I wake up". Earlier names include **jolveisre** (modern **jolleistr** "excursion, jaunt"), taken from Old Norse **jólveizla** "Yule feast", and **fleðoul** (of unknown ultimate etymology), both of which referred specifically to the celebrations.

Evidence of similar winter solstice festivities involving communally-prepared feasts on [[Borland]] predates even the Roman invasion, making Revillon one of the longest continuously-practised folk traditions in [[Europe]] (bearing in mind that the practice has evolved considerably with time). Third-century Roman historian Ammian Marcellinus provides us with an early written mention of the Winter Feast, which appears (under its original name **Flidōlus**, which gave the aforementioned **fleðoul**) in one of his asides on the [[Northwestern Isles]]. Post-imperial sources in the first millennium almost exclusively criticise the tradition as pagan and unholy; however, by the twelfth century the practice is fully appropriated by the Church.

Queen [[Natalia II of Borland]] abdicated on Revillon of 1894 as part of the political upheaval surrounding Borland's entry into the [[Drengot Collusion]].

## Food
Foods traditionally associated with the Revillon Feast include: 
- the **tort dell'ivan** /ˈtɔʀt ˌde.liˈvan/ ("child's pie", in reference to the Christ child), a savoury dish often of lamb. The practice of scoring a cross into the lid and hiding a small wooden object inside (traditionally also a cross) is a later innovation, but compare the similar **galette des rois** seen on the continent. This name for the dish is attested as early as the tenth century in Old Boral **torte del ifan** /tɔɾ.tə dɛl iˈfan/, although the modern recipe including lamb and potato is not seen in writing until the eighteenth century.
- **jonnovar zucarrað** /ˌʒɔ.noˈvaʀ ˌzi.kaˈʀaθ/ "candied butterflies", a sugar-spiced cakebread particular to the island which ever since their earliest iterations have been generously spiced (usually with dalassine bark and inchroot). At this time of year they are formed into butterfly shapes, popularly thought to represent the metamorphosis of a dead winter into the new life of spring.
