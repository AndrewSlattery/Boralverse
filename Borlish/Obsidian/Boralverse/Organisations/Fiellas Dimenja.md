Fiellas Dimenja (English: Sunday Sheets) is a weekly newspaper almost continuously published from [[Marsella]] since its incorporation in 1871. The paper's notional remit comprises entertainment and recreational news, although in practise it has regularly covered weightier subjects.

## History
Fiellas Dimenja was established in 1871 by Corsican businessman Toscobardo Matutte in concert with the Guiraud Colloquium.

Fiellas was an early adopter of machinal broadcast direct to homes via their tachygraphs, first offering digests in this form in the 1920s.

The paper developed a significant international readership through the twentieth century—by 1934 it was republished synchronously in [[Vascony]] and [[New Provence]], and was even read in Collusion territory, despite the rising tensions of the post-[[Millstone War|Millstone]] Europe. 

By 1950 it held the record for the longest uninterrupted weekly mass-market publication, without interruption by the [[1937 Veldsvindung]] nor the [[Millstone War]] (although it briefly moved its printers to Manòsca during the worst of the bombings).

Fiellas' renown grew further after its significant role in the [[Furore of 1961]], which (not undeservedly) earned the paper a reputation for investigative journalism alongside its ostensible purpose of delivering entertainment and recreational news.
