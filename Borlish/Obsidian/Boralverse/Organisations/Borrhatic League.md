The Borrhatic League is a collection of charitable organisations and political action groups with a focus on laic governance, education and (in recent decades) also pacifism and objection. The League grew from collaboration between working-class groups of minority faiths across Northern [[Europe]] in the early nineteenth century; the name derives from the Attic Greek Βορρᾶς • *Borrhâs* "the North Wind". The League first rose to prominences on the scale of polities during the [[Second German War]] of the 1820s and in its aftermath. For instance, [[Hilgart Bervisson|Hilgart]] and [[Michael Bervisson]] were influential in [[Borland]]'s Borrhatic League at this time, especially with regards to calls for religious tolerance

Although the Borrhatic League and the contemporaneous [[Deviance movement]] has (occasionally explosive) disagreements, both are known to have contributed verbiage to the 1850 [[Laic Declarations]] in Belgrade. Later in the nineteenth century the Borrhatic League funded orphanages and schools across the region, such as the Borrhatic School of History in the south-eastern Borlish city of [[Combert]], which exists to this day.
