The Papacy in [[Rome]] is the spiritual seat of much of Christendom.

Despite intermittent conflicts with the Greek patriarchs and several abortive antipope lineages, the Roman Papacy remained the ultimate authority over all Christendom until the [[German Secession]] of the early thirteen century. This created a lasting competing seat in the [[Augsburg See]] which did not recognise the Roman Papacy's legitimacy.

The [[Great Fracture]] of the mid-sixteenth century severely diminished the temporal powers of the Papacy. While on paper the Pope in Rome remained an absolute ruler (along with political dominion over several smaller Italian and German provinces), in practice the new [[Triunvirato]] had political dominion over the city of Rome.
