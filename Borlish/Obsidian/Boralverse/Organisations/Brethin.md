The Brethin are a Christian religious order devoted to record-keeping and the maintenance of history. They have societies worldwide and a history dating back to the early medieval period.

The Brethin take their name from the distinctive heavy cloak (in Old Welsh, the **bretin**) worn by all members.

The order was founded in eighth-century [[Tremonnow]]—at that time a border town of the new [[Kingdom of Greater Devon]]—under the patronage of [[Iseld of Devon|Iseld]], daughter of [[Vigo the Magnificent]]. Their original mandate was to preserve in particular the history of the Christianisation of [[Albion]] and [[Ireland]], but the scope of their work quickly expanded to include secular history.

Brethin houses spread rapidly throughout the Briton states, and in later centuries they made inroads into [[France]], [[Burgundy]] and as far afield as [[Andalus]] (although they would not gain a foothold in [[Italy]] until after the [[Great Fracture]] of the sixteenth century).

Not long after its inception, Brethin houses included both monasteries and convents, although in some regions institutions for one sex or the other predominated.

Of particular note are the Brethin of [[Kernow]]; they became the most influential school within the order during the late medieval period, with a substantial increase in membership through the twelfth century. At this time many courts of [[Europe]] employed monks of the Brethin of Kernow as advisors.

After the medieval period and until the modern day, the Brethin ran several major printing operations, such as the [[Yievle]] Brethin Primers, and educational institutions, such as the [[Tremonow Open School]] (formerly the Brethin Mesh Institute).
