The Jacobin Fraternity (Borlish *Fraterntað Jagovin*), historically also known as the Order of Saint James, is a religious organisation based in the city of [[Axbane]] on the south coast of [[Borland]]. 

The Fraternity were founded in tenth-century [[Flanders]] under the patronage of Amelia of Bruges. In the eleventh century they were implicated in a local popular uprising against Drengot Emperor Geoffry II and forced to flee over the sea to Borland. There they built the Peninsular Monastery which still overlooks Axbane.

Funds from the Fraternity contributed to the Jacobin Estates on the outskirts of Damvath, which on their completion in the late eighteenth century became the fixed location of Borland's parliament.

Today the organisation is known mostly for the guild they own, Jaibos Breweries, as well as for owning significant lands in the city (including the site of one of the ancient Roman bathhouses there).
