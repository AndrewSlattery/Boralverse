The Convoy Australier (Merch /ˈkɔn.vəi əˈstɾɛː.liːə/), officially the Order of Saint Hemma of Still Water, is a Christian organisation aligned with [[Rome]] which emerged in the [[Second Tetrarchy]] period. It has undergone several major transformations of purpose since its inception.
## History

The Convoy began in the eleventh century in the Duchy of [[Crain]], a member of the [[German Empire]] subordinate to [[Bavarn]]. In the first decades of its existence the Convoy was in essence a (quite literally) glorified band of mercenaries.

The Convoy was heavily involved in the first crusades and related ventures, from the [[Principality of Mystra]] in [[Greece]] to the unsuccessful forays in [[Jerusalem]]. It was appointed to administrate the new states of [[Antioch]] and [[Port Simon]] soon after their conquests in the twelfth century.

[[Pope Just]] revoked the Convoy's rulership of Antioch and Port Simon in 1208 as the culmination of a escalating inter-faction struggle. However, it is generally agreed that this act saved the Convoy a great amount of trouble in the long run (given the imminent disaster of the [[Failed Crusade]]). The Convoy was subsequently assigned to the courts of [[Svonimir of Crovatia]] and [[Taxon of Awry]]; it was thus ideally placed to lead the [[Baptism of the North]], even as the troubles of the [[German Secession]] loomed.

The German Secession increased the urgency of the Baptism of the North; Rome feared that [[Augsburg]] might spread its new heresy faster than Rome could reach the North. As a consequence, the Convoy grew substantially in numbers and wealth during the thirteenth century, and outlying chapters were founded as far afield as [[Borland]] and (eventually) [[Lithow]].
