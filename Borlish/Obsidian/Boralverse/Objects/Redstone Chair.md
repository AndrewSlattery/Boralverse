The Redstone Chair (Merch *Redstoan Sete* /ˈɾɛd.stoːn ˈsiːt/) was a wooden throne used by the monarchies of [[Albion]] during the medieval period.
## History
The Redstone Chair was fashioned in the late tenth century around a block of sandstone; the name of the carpenter is forgotten. This block was (allegedly) the block upon which the [[Elved Marriage]] between a princess of [[Markland]] and the ruler of Dane [[Northumber]] was solemnised, ending hostilities between the two polities for almost a century.

Many subsequent monarchs of Albion, and especially of Markland and Northumber, were crowned on the Redstone Chair. During the [[Second Tetrarchy]] of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, most of the [[First Drengot Empire|Drengot Emperors]] sat upon the Chair, and as such it was relocated to [[London]]. After the Empire's collapse, this placed the Chair in the politically turbulent region between Markland and [[Kent]]. Some historians have conjectured that the [[First Burning of London]] in 1290 was in part motivated by a plan to acquire the Chair; the responsible party varies in the telling.

According to the traditional account, it was a dispute over the location of the Redstone Chair which sparked the [[Wars of Fealty]], which lasted almost fifty years over the turn of the sixteenth century and which embroiled almost all the polities of Albion.

Unfortunately, the Chair was lost in the tumult of the wars at some point between 1505 and 1509. Despite several searches and at least two hoaxes, the Chair has never been recovered, and the modern understanding of its appearance rests entirely on depictions in a few portraits and coronation scenes.
