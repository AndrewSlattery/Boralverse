The Deviance movement, also known as Anti-Paradise theology, is a religious, artistic and political ideology characterised by non-conformity as well as exploration of the avant-garde in all areas of society. 

The term "deviance" has been applied to the movement almost since its inception, with both positive and negative affect. Some scholars have theorised that the term reflects the Wessern dialect pronunciation of standard "defiance", although this is not widely accepted.

# History
The Deviance movement arose in the late eighteenth century during the [[Long Peace]], in an environment of rapid scientific progress. In [[Europe]], much of the development of Anti-Paradise theology took place within the Promethean clubs of [[Albion]] and [[Kingdom of Danaw|Danaw]]. These regions were both home to significant religious minorities and the Church (of whichever stripe) was strongly associated with local authority.

An important early work to the Deviance movement was the anonymously-published 'And We Will Love the Fire' (originally *Et Nous Amerons les Fux*), which began circulating in 1799 to immediate moral outrage. Though almost a dozen plausible candidates for its authorship have been seriously proposed, no consensus has ever been reached on the issue.

The early Deviance movement coincided with the height of the [[Voidtale|voidtale]] craze launched by [[Elsebeth Sneider]]'s 1795 trevold 'Through a Black Mirror'. Many of the ideas conjured in voidtale works were incorporated into Anti-Paradise theology, and Sneider's works in particular were embraced by the movement. However, Sneider herself despised Anti-Paradism; in her own words:
> “It is not only their strange ideas and lonely, nihilist universe, dear Thifäne, but that so many of their number have approached me as if I were their most natural ally!”

The early public reaction to the Deviance movement varied significantly. It has been blamed for the resurgence of the [[Modest Arrangement]] in [[Spain]] and [[Gaul]].

In 1850 a tide of secularisation began with the passing of the [[Laic Declarations]] in [[Belgrade]], which have largely been credited to the strong influence of Anti-Paradise theology in the [[Riverine Cities]] after the collapse of Danaw.

In the later nineteenth century the Deviance movement was connected to the spread of the genre of [[Masquira romance|masquira romance]], possibly via their shared connections to tovarick communities.

# Features
Many composers of the early nineteenth century were affiliated with the Deviance movement, and considered their music to be in the Deviant spirit. The music of Deviance composers emphasised emotion and the manipulation of the audience, and this helped make music the least controversial part of Anti-Paradism in its first few decades.

The Deviance movement was interested in folk traditions and stories; one example is the European tale of the Wild Hunt, which was portrayed in the younger Crayenschot's opera *Ad Pentaculum*. They were particularly interested in those figures which had been cast as demons or evil spirits by the Church.

Supporters of the early Deviance movement are often portrayed as wearing lewd or otherwise-inappropriate clothing; it is difficult to ascertain the extent to which this reflected a real practice, as opposed to it being an invention by their detractors.
