The Modest Arrangement was a social movement in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries characterised by more stringent enforcement of morality codes, especially with respect to familial powers.

The Arrangement saw a resurgence in the regions of [[Gaul]] and [[Spain]] in the early nineteenth century after something of an ebb during the [[Long Peace]]. This has been attributed to the rising popularity of the [[Deviance movement]] inspiring a backlash among its opposers; certainly Modest ideology depicts itself as less secure and more embattled in its later incarnations.

One of the most salient aspects of the Modest Arrangement from the modern perspective is its propensity to censorship, particularly of works deemed contrary to decency. Famously, author Antòin Herrel (latterly Tony Smith) was forced to flee [[Vascony]] to [[Kent]] after attempting to publish his blasphemous work 'Earthly Scene' (**Vista Terrena**).

The [[Second German War]] of the 1820s saw the grip of the Modest Arrangement weaken in many places, if only incidentally—as faith in existing power structures waned so too did people's trust in those powers' enforcement of the law. The days of Modest Vascony were numbered almost as soon as its interests in [[Mendeva]] and the East were threatened and the [[Perzou Vallabrì|Vallabrì]] administration under [[Hernand, King of Vascony|King Hernand]] declared an alliance with the Convoy.

Although the Modest Arrangement would not survive the 1850 [[Laic Declarations]] in [[Belgrade]] in any official capacity, polities like Vascony, [[New Provence]] and [[Morrack]] would retain some hallmarks of the Arrangement well into the twentieth century.
