Masquira romance is a genre of stories which typically feature criminal (or crime-fighting) characters, as well as plots driven by hidden identities, high society and complicated schemes. It overlaps with the slightly-later spycraft genre, especially in modern works which draw on both literary traditions.

The name 'masquira' derives from [[Ezio Carvallo]]'s 1860 trevold *Tejan de Masquira ou Jalico* "In Either a Mask or a Suit", which is widely considered to have pioneered the genre.

The kevler romance is a subgenre of masquira focused on glamorous thefts, particularly popular in nineteenth-century [[Borland]].

# History
Although many of the tropes of the genre have been use in literature since time immemorial, we see the birth of a distinct genre of masquira romance in the late [[Global Workshop|Workshop period]], through the prolific work of Portingale author Ezio Carvallo. His dozen-strong series of trevolds, for example, almost single-handedly creates the concept of a kevler story (although we can see a parallel trend in the older Cathayan *tapsue* "magpie" tales).

The popularity of masquira supplanted to some extent the dwindling [[Voidtale|voidtale]] fashion in [[Europe]], as well as various herdtale traditions across the [[Novomund]]. 

In the 1940s and 50s there was a resurgence in popularity for masquira romance, christened the 'Spring Tide'; this period saw many film adaptations the genre's classics and thus cemented its place in modern popular culture.

# Social Detaxion
The narrative focus in masquira romance on characters with hidden identities has led several marginal groups to embrace masquira tales over the decades. Perhaps most notably, the genre was very popular early on with the semi-public tovarick communities in the [[Riverine Cities]]. These communities spread the influence of masquira through Europe and the [[Novomund]], particularly along with the broader [[Deviance movement]].

Indeed, the tovarism connection was barely obfuscated in some works (see particularly Takach's *We Will Burn Together*), and the popularity of the genre is widely understood to have contributed to the [[Household Renovation]].

The popularity of the subgenre of kevler romance in Borland during the [[Good Game]] period has attracted much commentary. In the context of a scandal-ridden royal family and a generalised class-levelling instinct pervading the politics of contemporary Borland, it is perhaps unsurprising that "stories of heroes entering high society as outsiders in connit in order to make away with the hoarded treasures of the intolerably wealthy" struck a particularly harmonious chord.
