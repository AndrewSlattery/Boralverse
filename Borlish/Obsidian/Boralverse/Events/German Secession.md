The German Secession was a schism in Christendom which took place in the first half of the thirteenth century. Often considered one of the most influential religious developments of the second millennium, it led to the permanent formalisation of the [[Augsburg]] See as independent from [[Rome]] with its separate papal line beginning with [[Paul I/XI]].

The Secession generally refers to the period from Paul I/XI's [[Pauline Denunciations|Denunciations]] and declaration of the *sedes sanctissima* in Augsburg in 1225 to the capitulation of Rome in 1251, although religious strife due to the schism would wrack the polities of Germany and surrounding regions for centuries to come.

The 1210 declaration of a renewed [[Failed Crusade|crusade for Jerusalem]] by Pope Just, and the military catastrophes that occurred in the course of this push, were a major source of discontentment in Rome. Further, [[Europe]] was at the time in the throes of the [[First Great Dying]], a plague that would be surpassed in severity only by the [[Second Great Dying]] of the early sixteenth century. (These events are related, in that the plague is thought to have arrived in Europe carried by returning crusaders).

The decades after the Pauline Denunciations saw each individual duchy (and in some cases each county!) declare either for Rome or for Augsburg, in an unstable patchwork of allegiances that would lead to the collapse of the [[German Empire]] in spectacular fashion.

The ongoing [[Baptism of the North]] (the project to fold the north-easternmost part of Europe into Christendom) was inflamed by the Secession. Along with a new, more totalist Roman Pope in Hermeneus II, it was feared that Augsburg might spread heresy faster than Rome could reach the North.

The events of the Secession have been a perennial subject of dramatisation, most famously (and perhaps most inaccurately) in 1961 historical epic 'With the North Star to Guide Us'.
