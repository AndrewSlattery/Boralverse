The Household Renovation of the late nineteenth century was an attitudinal shift towards non-traditional familial structures, the institution of marriage, and the social role of children.

It was prefigured by the deemphasis of religion in government in those countries party to the 1850 [[Laic Declarations]] of Belgrade, as well as contraceptive medical innovations of the time like coshow bed-sleeves and stauron retainers.

The popularity of the [[Masquira romance|masquira]] literary genre, with its hidden identities and lampooning of upper-class mores, is usually understood to have come hand in hand with the Household Renovation (not to mention the enduring popularity of masquira in tovarick circles).

Early embracers of the Household Renovation included [[Britain]], the [[Riverine Cities]] and [[New Leudong]]; the ethos would spread (especially via Britain's cultural cachet in [[Gulf Mendeva]]) elsewhere over the subsequent decades.
