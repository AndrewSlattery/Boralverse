The First Burning of London was a conflagration in 1290 which lasted for a full week and killed approximately four hundred people. This was the earliest of several such burnings, at least two of which are more accurately described as sackings or conquerings. Unlike (say) the [[Fourth Burning of London|Fourth Burning]], it is purely conjectural that this particular fire was deliberately set as part of a plot to steal the [[Redstone Chair]] (presumably orchestrated by some [[Markland|Merch]] or [[Kent|Kentish]] noble).
