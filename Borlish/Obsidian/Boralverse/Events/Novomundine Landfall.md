The **Novomundine Landfall** (Borlish *Abanc Novomondin*) occurred in 1471 N, when a ship that was part of a [[New Navarre Enterprise]] fishing expedition in the North [[Atlantic]] sighted and made landfall on the island of [[Brasil]]. It marks the start of prolonged contact between the [[Vetomund]] and the [[Novomund]] (notwithstanding evidence of sporadic [[Norrish]] contact with the region), and the first century following the Landfall is known to historians as the [[Intertwining Century]].

The terms Novomund and [[Mendeva]] date to this voyage; a surviving map from the Landfall voyage itself is marked *terrae mendevalensis*, after the [[Vask]] *mendeval* "west".

The Landfall occurred at the height of the so-called [[Vascon Ascendancy]], when [[Vascony]] reached its territorial maximum under [[Ambrose III of Vascony|Ambrose III]], and the trade opportunities that arose over the following decades were just as beneficial for the polity. Ambrose's rival, [[Munir al-Hamdawi of Morrack|Munir al-Hamdawi]] of [[Morrack]], quickly redirected the efforts of his presciently-named [[New World Company]] westward (having previously maintained trade routes to the East), leading to the discovery of the faster southern route to the Novomund and the islands of the [[Arcabil]].

The first Vetomundine royal to set foot in the Novomund was King Ambrose's elder sister Princess [[Alexandra of Vascony]], who visited the new settlement of [[Paratzon]] in the 1490s. It is unknown why she (and several female attendants) undertook the voyage, although her second husband's various deficiencies and scandals have been implicated. Her visit is remembered for advancing understanding of scurvy (the chemical [[Sandrine|sandrine]] is named in her honour), although it would take over a century and experiments with guy-conies before ships could come close to effectively preventing the malady.
