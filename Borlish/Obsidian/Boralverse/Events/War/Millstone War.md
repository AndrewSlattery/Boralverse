The Millstone War (1897–1908, Borlish *Var a Couð*) refers to the period of global military conflict often considered to be the dawn of modern warfare.

Though not all of the wars involved spanned the entire eleven years, they are all characterised by a fundamental asymmetry: defensive tactics had outstripped offensive technology. Due to this, front lines worldwide ground to barely-moving trench fortifications.

The Millstone War marks the end of the [[Good Game]] period; its aftermath saw a comprehensive realignment of the previous system of alliances.

The last years of the Millstone War saw the first military use of aircraft, as well as air-bombing of cities including [[Marsella]] in [[Provence]].

Political tensions rose globally in the decades after the Millstone War, as the inadequacy of the post-war settlements became apparent. In particular, relations between [[Drengot Collusion]] and their southern neighbours of [[Vascony]] and Provence quickly soured.
