The Failed Crusade was an undertaking which aimed to recreate the March of Jerusalem. The city and its surrounds had been captured during the [[First Crusade]] and the first Marksman of Jerusalem, [[Savino the Just]], had acceded in 1119, but it had fallen less than seventy years later.

This crusade was called in 1210 by Pope Just (a direct descendant of Lord Savino), and it was utterly unsuccessful. The campaign went so badly that the Convoy Australier having their control of Port Simon and Antioch revoked in 1208 is generally regarded as a boon for the Convoy.

The various military catastrophes stoked discontent in [[Rome]] and elsewhere, along with the outbreak of the [[First Great Dying]] (a plague thought to have been brought to [[Europe]] by returning crusaders).
