The Second German War (1815–23) was a conflict centred on German lands but involving almost all the polities of Europe. It took place in the early nineteenth century and marks the conventional end of the [[Long Peace]]. This war is considered part of the global phenomenon of [[Reaction War]], which includes politically unrelated but contemporaneous conflicts around the world.

Although [[Vascony]] at first managed not to become embroiled in the conflict, once its interests in [[Mendeva]] and the East were threatened, then-king Hernand IV had no choice but to declare against the [[Northern Concert]] and in favour of the Convoy.

[[Borland]] participated in the war, with Borlish soldiers present alongside Bavarn and [[Furlain]] fighters at the disastrously mismanaged [[Battle of Hulm (1821)|Battle of Hulm]] in 1821.

The Northern Concert were a major power involved in the war, and they were allied with Borland, not uncontroversially—the alliance sparked many mozard protests in cities across the country.

The Kingdom of [[France]] was seen to have profited unjustly from the Second German War, gaining significant territory while (according to many) not investing much manpower or material resources.

The [[Kingdom of Danaw]] collapsed in spectacular fashion in the wake of the war, laying the groundwork for the rise of the [[Riverine Cities]].

In the 1820s and 30s, immigration to the [[Novomund]] (and especially to [[New Provence]]) spiked from those countries which had been most devastated by the war.
