The Democratic Wars were a collection of international and civil wars which took place in the mid-eighteenth century.

The earliest incarnations of [[Steeplepost|steeplepost]] technology are seen during the Democratic Wars; usually these consisted of lines of temporary signal towers which could only send simple coded messages, such as an hour to lunch an assault. One more advanced and permanent system was used to connect Cordova to Malaga in [[Andalus]] during their particular conflict with [[Morrack]].  

[[Albion]] saw many changes in the aftermath of the Democratic Wars. Long contested between [[Markland]] and [[Kent]], the city of [[London]] found itself newly independent for one final, lasting time.

The end of the Democratic Wars and the concomitant massive migrations of people is suspected to have contributed to the global spread of [[Pennackit dysentery|pennackit dystentery]], which begins in earnest in 1753.
