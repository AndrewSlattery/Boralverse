The Romantic Wars were a loosely-circumscribed collection of wars, uprisings and other conflicts across [[Europe]] which took place through the middle of the seventeenth century. As a whole they are sometimes considered the last truly localised conflicts, since by the next century wars of similar scales would begin to involve the [[Novomund]], and would feature alliances between the powers of Europe, [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] alike. The years 1640 to 1670 cover the 'central' conflicts of the Romantic Wars, although some more peripheral fights may spill earlier or later. 

The Romantic period (to wit, the decades during with the Romantic Wars took place) was characterised by great corrogation projects. For example, the [[Bordew]]-Audaz canal was completed in 1679, connecting the Atlantic and the Middlesea without having to pass through [[Morrack]]-controlled seas.

Perennial adversaries [[Vascony]] and Morrack continued their protracted fight through the seventeenth century. Having been on a marked decline for a century, Vascony was forced to cede its economic heart in [[Portingale]] to [[Andalus]], which at that time was controlled by Morrack.

Several polities and vassal states did not survive the Romantic Wars; for example, the [[Principality of Mystra]] in [[Greece]], which had existed as a vassal of the [[Second Roman Empire]] since the eleventh century, was formally dissolved in the aftermath of the Romantic Wars.

[[Willemy]] was the focal point of the Blue Trans-Willem War (not to be confused with the Red Trans-Willem War), which indirectly led to the dissolution of the Kingdom of [[Burgundy]] and the creation of the Duchy of Far Suebia in [[Bavarn]].

[[Borland]]'s involvement in the Romantic Wars was restricted to a failed invasion (culminating in the Hawkirch Surrender of 1623), along with unstable arrangements with neighbouring polities regarding military aid in their conquests.

Much has been made of the involvement of pirates (to a greater or lesser extend endorsed by political powers) in the Romantic Wars, although recent historiography tends to downplay how much impact these factions really had.

The Roman conflict in [[Armenia]] of the 1640s is contemporaneous with the Romantic Wars, but its inclusion within them is a matter of scholarly dispute. Opponents point out that this fight was merely the latest in a series of essentially-identical conflicts between the Second Roman Empire and Arab (and later Turkish) peoples over control of the Hazaran Sea.
