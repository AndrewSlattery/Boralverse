The Battle of Rexam (Merch *Feight at Rexam* /fɛʃt ət ˈɾɛksəm/, Cambric *Brwydr Car Vanteł* /ˈbɾuː.də kaː vənˈtɛɬ/) was a major combat between [[Markland]] and the Kingdom of [[Britain]] which took place in 1483 during the [[Wars of Fealty]].

Rexam (formerly in the Merch language spelt *Wrexham*) had been a contested town on the border of [[Wales]] and [[Markland]] almost from the moment the latter was founded. In 1301, in an act which reignited the [[Mallor Wars]], [[Andrew II of Markland|King Andrew II]] [[Sack of Rexam|sacked]] the town.

The relatively-new Kingdom of Britain (formed of Wales and its outlying tallaths, along with [[Kernow]] and [[Sodrick]]) began in the Wars of Fealty from a position of strength, and managed early on to extract many concessions from Markland. This culminated in a decisive victory at the Battle of Rexam, where the last Duke of Chester was killed.

After this battle, Britain was able to take lasting control of the area around Rexam (though the attack on the city of Chester shortly thereafter was rebuffed). The polity then managed to recuse itself from the continued conflicts of the Wars of Fealty; the other polities of [[Albion]] would remain embroiled for another thirty years.

The battle and its aftermath were portrayed in 1931 work "Children of the Battle of Rexam" (released originally in Cambric as *Pa Ðywdon y Plant Car Vanteł* "What the Children of Car Vantel Said"), a fictionalised account of the three orphaned children of the Duke of Chester.
