The Mendevan Unmooring (Borlish *Deshormejanç Mendevan* /deˌzɔr.meˈʒants ˌmɛn.deˈvan/) is the collective name for the various wars and diplomatic developments at the turn of the nineteenth century which led to the weakening and sometimes severing of formal ties of polities in [[Mendeva]] from those in the [[Vetomund]]. The more explosive conflicts such as the [[War for Ambrosia]] and the [[Hasinick Revolution]] (against [[Vascony]] and [[Britain]], respectively) often overshadow quieter events like the [[Departure of Mashick]].
