The Romantic Revival (Borlish *Resorgenç Romannesc* /reˈzɔr.gɛnts ˌro.maˈnɛx/) was an artistic and political movement which arose towards the end of the eighteenth century. It was characterised by optimistic portrayals of heroism, and especially a belief in a 'brighter past' in the seventeenth century that could be recaptured. It is due to this movement's depiction that a loose congeries of wars in the mid-seventeenth century have become known as the [[Romantic Wars]].
