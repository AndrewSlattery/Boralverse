The Phœbos was a flagship of the Kingdom of [[Britain]] in the early sixteenth century. Having profited greatly from the disruption of the [[Wars of Fealty]], Britain under [[Howel of Britain|King Howel]] sought to extend its trade mesh past its posts down the west African coast and into Asia directly.

To this end, ships led by the Phœbos (captained by mac Kellot) were tasked with sailing as far east as possible. After rounding Africa and making port in such places as [[Ungotia]], they were directed by [[Uman|Umanick]] and then [[Chinese]] traders. Via [[Gurjat]] and [[Madray]], they eventually arrived in [[Borune]], at that time the southeasternmost land known in the [[Vetomund]].

The Phœbos was thus present at the [[Great Borunesk Meeting]] of 1517. The ship's meeting with the [[Morrack]] ship the Cynthia in the port city of Sinquan is the definitive moment in the course of the Meeting. It appears in several book and film adaptations. It is popularly assumed that the crews could not understand one another; in fact at least a dozen crewmembers of the Phœbos spoke some Arabic, as the British and Morrack trade meshes had overlapped for centuries.

Unlike the Cynthia, the Phœbos would not attempt to circumnavigate the globe; tales of the magnitude of the oceans ahead dissuaded mac Kellot from such a course.
