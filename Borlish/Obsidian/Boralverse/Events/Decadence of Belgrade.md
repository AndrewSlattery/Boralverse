The Decadence of Belgrade refers to the [[Kingdom of the Danaw]] in its final decades before the [[Second German War]] (1815–23) and the subsequent dissolution of the state. The Decadence also represents the territorial maximum of the kingdom, having wrested [[Bulgary]] from the suzerainty of the [[Second Roman Empire]] after the latter's final collapse in the seventeenth century, and more recently having consolidated control over lands at the northwestern border with [[Bavarn]].
