The Great Flie Flood was a natural disaster in 1171 [[Willemy]] which submerged or swept through large parts of [[Frisland]]. Waters of the [[Rustig Strait]] created the island of [[Texel]], and the freshwater Lake Almere (which fed into the Strait along the Flie river) became brackish and eventually fully saline as a maritime gulf.

Then-duke [[Lovis the Tall]], who had been staying in the environs of [[Amstel]] for some months, is the most famous (and most historically influential) casualty of the Flood, but estimates have suggested a death toll approaching ten thousand.

The destruction is thought to have spurred the development of [[Axbane]] on [[Borland]] as an alternative harbour for traders passing through the Rustigh Strait.
