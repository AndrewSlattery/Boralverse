\et 19C from Dutch jaght "hunting party" via the phrase De Wildjacht “The Wild Hunt”, which refers to the folkloric hunting party of ghosts and spirits crossing the sky during storms. Referred to in Cráyenschot's opera Ad Pentaculum, in which much of the plot follows main character Jochem’s induction into the Wildjacht. The Wildjacht was often shortened to simply the Jacht, especially in later adaptations and translations as novels and films. The opera itself portrays the Wildjacht very much as a secret society of people with supernatural powers, and so in popular culture the term “Yacht” came to refer generally to occult groups.
