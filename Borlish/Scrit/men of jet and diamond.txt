It would be an exaggeration to say that the hotel's lobby is crowded. Nonetheless, Zoë Pentross finds she cannot take a seat without inserting herself into someone's lively conversation or another's relaxed solitude. Instead she remains standing at the bar, keys in her left hand and a gratifyingly-good Empordan wine in her right.

"Are you here to see the new King arrive in Nadacou?" A tall, slender man joins Zoe at the bar, signalling the tender for a refill.

"Not to see His Grace, per se," Zoe demurs, taking the opportunity to turn and look properly at her new companion. Dark hair, closely-shorn—not typical among those with long family ties in the area, though his complexion suggests he isn't entirely foreign.

"Ah, of course!” The smile that spreads across the man's face is charming and curious. Someone delighted at mystery, perhaps, or at least someone willing to humour it for the sake of conversation. "You plan to stand one street over from tomorrow's parade, I take it?"

Half an hour, far too much shockled cake and a generous glass of limmon acquetta later, Zoe strides out of the new unmanned lifter and peers at the ornate signposts. The key in her hand is helpfully inscribed with a fullaw bird and the number four in neat script, so she turns down the corresponding corridor until she finds her door, set discreetly into the wall. Inside, the set of rooms (really, not much more than a small parlour and a bed in an alcove) is decorated in the latest Morrack fashions, all exposed stonework draped in tapestries and curtains. The ewer in the corner even has a handle in the shape of a viper.
