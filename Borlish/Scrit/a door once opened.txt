The bookseller of Hawthorn Street was a handsome man of perhaps thirty years, and the first time Frederick met him, on a balmy summer evening in 1755, he had (by dint of some quick gossip with his sister) learnt two things about the man: first, he sold books of a higher quality and a lower price than anyone else in Sowbruck, or maybe even all of London, and yet always seemed as impeccably maintained as any professional in the borough (despite the reportedly small size of his household); and second, he would vanish for days at a time with little warning and still less in the way of excuses.

Fred had been privately convinced that the man was discreetly employed by the Lord Mayor's office, or by one of the better-concealed deparments of Her Majesty's administration—though bookseller seemed an odd role to foist upon a spy.

The shop itself was cramped and maze-like, with shelves overflowing with everything from pamphlets to great collections of heavy tomes. The air was redolent of paper and ink, though it lacked the dusty haze Fred had expected, and golden evening light illuminated the space through the shop's large street-facing windows. In the far corner sat a large mahogany desk with a high-backed chair behind it, and on the wall behind that was hung a map of the city larger than any he had ever seen.

By the chair stood the bookseller, closing a small book bound in green leather and looking up to greet him.

"Good evening, sir," the bookseller said, inclining his head in a way that was both courtly and conspiratorial—at once too formal for a tradesman and too obviously self-aware for a trained actor. "I don't believe we've met before. I'm Brandon Cavendish."

"Frederick Walton, at your service," Frederick replied, extending his hand. Cavendish's grip was dry and cool, his handshake firm without being crushing.

"Are you here to browse, Mr Walton, or did you have a particular volume in mind?"

"Nothing so planned," Frederick said. "I am recently arrived from Goring and in dire need of some new reading material."

"Then you've come to the right place," the bookseller said with a smile. "Let me show you what we have."
